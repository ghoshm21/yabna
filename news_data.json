      "summary": "Ministers claim sale in Hong Kong is unlawful and are demanding repatriation of relics buried in third-century BC",
      "content": "The Indian government has issued a legal notice to halt the \"unethical\" auction of ancient gem relics, which it said should be treated as the sacred body of the Buddha. Its ministry of culture said the auction of the Piprahwa gems in Hong Kong this week \"violates Indian and international laws, as well as United Nations conventions\", and demanded their repatriation to India \"for preservation and religious veneration\". The legal notice has been served on Sotheby's Hong Kong and Chris Peppe, one of three heirs of William Claxton Peppe, a British colonial landowner who in 1898 excavated the gems on his estate in northern India, who are selling the relics. The auction, which has prompted an outcry by scholars and monastic leaders, is scheduled for 7 May, and the gems are expected to sell for about HK$100m (PS9.7m). A letter, posted on the ministry of culture's Instagram account, said Peppe, a Los Angeles-based television director and film editor, lacked the authority to sell the relics. Sotheby's, by holding the auction, was \"participating in continued colonial exploitation\", it added. The ministry insisted on the immediate cessation of the auction, stating that the gem relics \"constitute inalienable religious and cultural heritage of India and the global Buddhist community\". It also called on Sotheby's and Chris Peppe to issue a public apology to the Indian government and Buddhists worldwide, and for the full disclosure of all provenance documents and any other relics in the possession of William Peppe's heirs or transferred by them to any other entity or individual. Failure to comply would result in legal proceedings in Indian and Hong Kong courts and international bodies \"for violations of cultural heritage laws\", the letter warned. The ministry added that it would launch a public campaign highlighting Sotheby's role \"in perpetuating colonial injustice and becoming a party to [the] unethical sale of religious relics\". The gems include amethysts, coral, garnets, pearls, rock crystals, shells and gold, either worked into pendants, beads, and other ornaments, or in their natural form. They were originally buried in a dome-shaped funerary monument, called a stupa, in Piprahwa, in present-day Uttar Pradesh, India, about 240-200BC, when they were mixed with some of the cremated remains of the Buddha, who died about 480BC. The British crown claimed Peppe's find under the 1878 Indian Treasure Trove Act, and the bones and ash were given to the Buddhist monarch King Chulalongkorn of Siam. Most of the 1,800 gems went to what is now the Indian Museum in Kolkata. Peppe was permitted to retain approximately a fifth of them, which were described as \"duplicates\" of some of the others. On the matter of the gems' provenance and ownership, the ministry's letter noted that under the Buddhist religion materials in sacred funerary mounds are \"sacred grave goods ... inseparable from the sacred relics and cannot be commodified. \"We beg to note that the relics of the Buddha cannot be treated as 'specimens' but as the sacred body and originally interred offerings to the sacred body of the Buddha.\" The ministry added that the sellers, who describe themselves as custodians of the gems \"had no right to alienate or misappropriate the asset ... an extraordinary heritage of humanity where custodianship would include not just safe upkeep but also an unflinching sentiment of veneration towards these relics.\" Its letter said the proposed auction \"offends the sentiments of over 500 million Buddhists worldwide\", violated ethics and disrupted sacred tradition. Peppe, who wrote a piece for Sotheby's about his family's custodianship of the gems, has been contacted for comment. He previously told the Guardian that the \"Piprahwa gems were relic offerings made at the time of the reinterment of the Buddha's ashes over 200 years after his passing. I have not found any Buddhists who claim the gems are corporeal remains.\" With regards to his and his two relatives' right to sell the gems, he added: \"Legally, the ownership is unchallenged.\" Sotheby's has been contacted for comment. It previously told the Guardian that it has conducted \"requisite due diligence\", including in relation to provenance and legality. The Indian ministry of culture's Instagram post stated that \"Sotheby's has responded to the legal notice with the assurance that full attention is being given to this matter.\"",

      "title": "Middle East crisis: Gaza offensive includes ‘wide-scale attack’ and ‘moving majority of the population’, says IDF – as it happened",
      "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/may/05/israel-gaza-yemen-middle-east-crisis-live-updates",
      "published": "2025-05-05",
      "summary": "Israeli military statement comes as UN chief expresses ‘alarm’ at plans to expand military operations in Gaza; Israeli reportedly strikes Hodeidah in Yemen",
      "content": "It's just past 10pm in Gaza and Tel Aviv. Here's a recap of the latest developments: Benjamin Netanyahu announced a new \"intensified\" offensive in Gaza that will involve Israeli troops holding on to seized territory and significant displacement of the population. Israeli soldiers would not go into Gaza, launch raids and then retreat, Netanyahu said. \"The intention is the opposite of that ... Population will be moved, for its own protection.\" Israel's security cabinet approved the plan on Sunday night for \"conquering\" the Gaza Strip and establishing a \"sustained presence\" there. The plan, which was unanimously approved, goes beyond any aims so far outlined by Israel for its offensive in the devastated Palestinian territory. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said the new offensive, named Operation Gideon's Chariots, would \"include a wide-scale attack and the movement of the majority of the strip's population. The announcement is a significant moment, at least in terms of public rhetoric, and will confirm many people's long-held fears of Israel's intentions in Gaza and prompt international outrage. The Israeli announcement prompted deep international concern and fierce opposition. A spokesperson for the UN secretary general, Antonio Guterres, said the Israeli plan will \"inevitably lead to countless more civilians killed and the further destruction of Gaza.\" A spokesperson for the British Foreign Office said: \"The UK does not support an expansion of Israel's military operations in Gaza. Continued fighting is in nobody's interests.\" Donald Trump did not offer his views on Israel's plan but blamed Hamas for having treated the people of Gaza \"very badly\". The US will \"help the people of Gaza get some food,\" Trump told reporters at the White House. \"Hamas is making it impossible, because they're taking everything that's brought in.\" Israel sees Trump's visit to the Middle East next week as a \"window of opportunity\" for a hostage deal in Gaza. Israel is reportedly trying to \"leverage\" the US president's trip to push Hamas to accept a deal, with a report claiming that Israel will launch a massive ground operation if no deal is reached. Israel's military said it carried out airstrikes against Yemen's Hodeidah port, a day after the Houthi group fired a missile that struck near Israel's main airport. More than 10 strikes targeted Hodeidah Port and the Al Salakhanah and Al Hawak neighbourhoods in Hodeidah City, Reuters reported. Four strikes also targeted a cement factory east of Hodeidah. The announcement of Israel's plan to launch imminently a new, expanded offensive in Gaza and to retain the territory it seized is a significant moment, at least in terms of public rhetoric. Throughout the nearly 19-month war, Israeli troops have carried out large and frequently bloody operations that have covered all except central parts of Gaza, but they have largely restricted their permanent presence to a buffer zone about 1km deep along the devastated territory's perimeter and two relatively narrow east-west corridors. This now seems to have changed. Once \"Operation Gideon's Chariots\" is under way, Israel will send its troops across much - if not all - of Gaza, and will seek to establish a \"sustained presence\" there, Israel officials said. Israeli officials are also talking openly about the displacement of Palestinians to southern Gaza, and their potential \"voluntary\" displacement from the territory altogether to allow the implementation of the reconstruction plan announced by the US president, Donald Trump, in January. The far-right Israeli finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, told Israelis on Monday to embrace the word \"occupation\". All this will confirm many people's long-held fears of Israel's intentions in Gaza and prompt international outrage. Read the full analysis here: Announcement of Israel's Gaza occupation plan is carefully timed Donald Trump has said the US will \"help the people of Gaza get some food\" as he blamed Hamas for having treated them \"very badly\". Asked about Israeli plans for an expanded offensive in Gaza, Trump did not offer his views on Israel's operations. Instead, he said: Hamas is making it impossible, because they're taking everything that's brought in. But we're going to help the people of Gaza because they're being treated very badly by Hamas. Israel's air force has confirmed it carried out strikes in Yemen's port city of Hodeidah. In a series of posts on X, it said the attack by its fighter jets was carried out in response to Houthi attacks against Israeli targets. The statement continues: The [Israel Defense Forces] IDF is determined to continue to act and strike forcefully against anyone who poses a threat to the residents and citizens of the State of Israel. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said its planned expanded offensive in Gaza includes a \"wide-scale attack\" and \"moving the majority of the population\" of the Palestinian territory. A statement from IDF spokesperson Effie Defrin, reported by the Times of Israel, says: The goal of the operation is the return of our hostages and the defeat of Hamas's rule. These two goals are combined with each other. The offensive \"will include a wide-scale attack and the movement of the majority of the strip's population, this is to protect them in an area sterile of Hamas. And continued airstrikes, elimination of terrorists, and dismantling of infrastructure,\" he said. Israel's plan to expand its military operation in Gaza was unanimously approved at a security cabinet meeting late on Sunday. Officials have said it would involved a new and intense offensive leading to \"the conquest of Gaza and the holding of the territories, moving the Gaza population south for their protection [and] ... powerful blows against Hamas\", going beyond any aims so far outlined by Israel for its offensive in Gaza. The UN's secretary general Antonio Guterres is \"alarmed\" by Israeli plans to expand military operations in Gaza and seek the \"conquest\" of the territory, a UN spokesperson has said. \"This will inevitably lead to countless more civilians killed and the further destruction of Gaza,\" said Farhan Haq, adding: Gaza is, and must remain, an integral part of a future Palestinian state. Israeli officials have confirmed that the Israeli air force is carrying out strikes in Yemen's port city of Hodeidah, the Times of Israel is reporting. Separately, Axios is citing an Israeli official as saying that the strikes were coordinated with the US but that American forces were not actively involved. A US official confirmed that Israel notified Washington in advance of the strike, Axios reports. Israel's air force has conducted airstrikes in the port city of Hodeidah in Yemen, Reuters reports, citing Houthi-affiliated media. Six strikes targeted the Hodeidah port, Al Masirah TV reported, blaming the strikes on Israel and the US. The reported strikes come after the Houthi group fired a missile from Yemen at the grounds of Israel's main airport on Sunday morning. As we reported earlier, Israel's prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, had vowed to retaliate against the Houthis after the strike. We reported earlier that a senior Israeli defence official said there was a \"window of opportunity\" for a hostage deal in Gaza during Donald Trump's visit to the region next week. The Times of Israel, citing an Israeli official said Israel is trying to \"leverage\" the US president's trip to push Hamas to accept a deal. Qatar is no longer \"putting spokes in the wheels\" of the Egyptian proposal for a deal, the official told the outlet. The paper quotes the official as saying: We hope that all these factors will come together in the coming days and maybe will lead to a deal ... If we come to an agreement, that is, if Hamas agrees to the Israeli conditions - because that is the only way we will reach an agreement - then the rest of the hostages would be released and the war would end. Israel's far-right national security minister, Itamar Ben Gvir, has reiterated his opposition to any humanitarian aid entering Gaza. His comments came after Israel's security cabinet approved a plan to seize all of the Gaza Strip, including allowing the Israeli military to take over aid deliveries into the Palestinian territory. Ben-Gvir was the only one who voted against the proposal. \"The only aid that ought to enter Gaza should be for voluntary migration, to allow them to emigrate voluntarily,\" he said in comments carried by Israeli media. As long as there are hostages no food, no electricity, and no other aid should be allowed - neither by the [Israeli military] nor by civil society. Donald Trump said he had a \"very good and productive\" call with Turkey's president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on Monday. The pair discussed the war in Ukraine and \"all things Syria, Gaza, and more,\" Trump said in a post on his Truth Social platform. Trump said he was invited to go to Turkey and that Erdogan will also be visiting Washington DC. The Turkish presidency, in its readout of the Trump-Erdogan call, said Erdogan expressed support for US negotiations with Iran and efforts to end the Russia-Ukraine war. Finland's minister for foreign affairs, Elina Valtonen, has said she is \"deeply concerned\" about Israel's plans to expand its military operation in Gaza. In a post on X on Monday, Valtonen wrote: I once again urge all parties to return to a ceasefire, and Hamas to immediately release the remaining hostages. Israel must ensure unimpeded access of humanitarian aid to Gaza. Here's more from Iran's foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, who accused Benjamin Netanyahu of \"directly meddling\" with the US government to \"drag it into another disaster\" in the Middle East region. The Israeli leader is attempting to \"brazenly dictate what President [Donald] Trump can and cannot do in his diplomacy with Iran,\" Araghchi wrote in a post on X on Monday. Iran's top diplomat warned against any attempt to attack Iran: If the goal is \"The only thing they can't have is a nuclear weapon\" as President Trump just said, a deal is achievable and there is only ONE PATH to achieve it: DIPLOMACY based on MUTUAL RESPECT and MUTUAL INTERESTS. His comments came after Netanyahu blamed Tehran after the Iran-backed Houthi group claimed a missile strike near Israel's main airport on Sunday. Iran denied any role in the attack. It also comes after the latest round of nuclear talks with the US, which were scheduled for 3 May, were delayed with mediator Oman citing \"logistical reasons\". Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu said a new offensive in Gaza will be an intensive military operation aimed at defeating Hamas that would involve moving the population of Gaza. He stopped short of detailing just how much of the enclave's territory would be seized following earlier reports that Israel could aim to capture the whole of the Gaza Strip. Two Israeli officials said earlier today that Israel's security cabinet had approved a plan to capture all of the Gaza Strip and remain there for an unspecified amount of time. The two officials said the plan would involve the displacement of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians to southern Gaza. A senior Israeli defence official said there was a \"window of opportunity\" for a hostage deal in Gaza during US President Donald Trump's visit to the region next week. It allows for the possibility that Israel might agree to a ceasefire in the meantime. Israel will not withdraw from the Gaza Strip even if there is another hostage deal is reached, far-right finance minister Bezalel Smotrich insisted as he called on Israelis to embrace the word \"occupation.\" \"We are finally going to occupy the Gaza Strip. We will stop being afraid of the word 'occupation,'\" Smotrich told journalist from Israel's Channel 12. An Israeli campaign group said the plan would mean \"sacrificing\" hostages held in the Palestinian territory. \"The plan approved by the cabinet deserves to be called the 'Smotrich-Netanyahu Plan' for sacrificing the hostages,\" the Hostages and Missing Families Forum said in a statement. Yemen's Houthis said the US carried out strikes in and around Sana'a, after the Iran-backed rebels claimed a missile strike on Israel's main airport yesterday. The Houthi-run Saba news agency said the strikes included two on Arbaeen Street in the capital and the airport road, blaming them on \"American aggression\". Saba said 16 people were wounded. Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that a new offensive in Gaza will be an intensive military operation aimed at defeating Hamas, but stopped short of detailing just how much of the enclave's territory would be seized, Reuters reports. \"Population will be moved, for its own protection,\" Netanyahu said in a video posted on X. He said Israeli soldiers won't go into Gaza, launch raids and then retreat. \"The intention is the opposite of that,\" he said. Earlier today two Israeli officials said Israel's security cabinet had approved a plan to capture all of the Gaza Strip and remain there for an unspecified amount of time. There was one arrest at a protest outside Israel's parliament, the Knesset today, according to the Times of Israel. Demonstrators were protesting against Benjamin Netayahu's government and for the return of the remaining 59 hostages trapped in Gaza. Police forcibly dispersed protesters who were blocking the road leading to the prime minister's office. peaking to Israel's Channel 12, protesters said they showed up to demonstrate over a number of issues, including the failure to recover the hostages, the mass call-up of IDF reservists, and the treatment of the country's educators amid ongoing wage disputes. Iran's foreign minister Abbas Araghchi has accused Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu of attempting to drag the US into \"disaster\" in the Middle East, warning against any attempt to attack Iran, AFP reports. \"Netanyahu is directly MEDDLING within the US Government to DRAG it into another DISASTER in our region,\" Araghchi said on X, warning against \"ANY mistake against Iran\". France has condemned the Houthi strike against Israel's Ben Gurion airport yesterday. \"The Houthi attacks against Israel are unacceptable and can only fuel high regional tensions, further delaying an end to the conflict. They must cease immediately,\" a statement from the French foreign ministry said. \"France reiterates its commitment to Israel's security and reaffirms the right of the Israeli people to live in peace and security, as well as its commitment to regional stability.\" \"The Ministry for Europe and Foreign Affairs, through its diplomatic and consular network, remains attentive to the situation of French citizens present in Israel, whether residents or passing through.\" An Israeli parliamentary committee is debating a law that would impose an 80% tax on non-government organisations that receive the majority of their funding from foreign entities, Reuters reports. Under the proposed law, these NGOs would not be able to petition Israeli courts. Israel's finance minister, though, would be able to grant an exemption from the tax. The debate in the Knesset's constitution, law and justice committee was at times heated and divided along coalition lines. The panel is preparing the bill for a first reading in the main plenum. \"This law will preserve a Jewish state and a democratic regime, and will block improper foreign interference,\" said Ariel Kallner, the bill's sponsor, during the debate. Opposition politicians criticised the proposed law, saying the state was trying to stifle voices, including the media, that don't agree with Israel's policies. Some said that if the government sought to prevent foreign influence, then companies should also be targeted. Adalah, the Legal Center for Arab Minority Rights in Israel, sent a letter signed by nine NGOs to the head of the committee, urging the bill be halted. \"This bill is a direct assault on civil society, the rule of law, and the basic constitutional structure of Israel's democracy,\" the letter said. \"It threatens the rights of individuals and communities and seeks to silence legitimate dissent under the guise of sovereignty.\" AFP has spoken to the head of the Norwegian Refugee Council, who has criticised an Israeli plan to take over the distribution of humanitarian aid to Gaza at hubs controlled by the military. \"We cannot and will not do something which is fundamentally against humanitarian principles,\" Jan Egeland said. He said \"the United Nations agencies, all other international humanitarian groups and NGOs have said no to be part of this idea coming from the Israeli cabinet and from the Israeli military.\" Egeland said the Israeli government wanted to \"militarise, manipulate, politicise the aid by allowing only aid to a few concentration hubs in the south, a scheme where people will be screened, where it's a completely inoperable system.\" \"That would force people to move to get aid, and it would continue the starvation of the civilian population,\" he said, adding: \"We will have no part in that.\" \"If one side in a bitter armed conflict tries to control, manipulate, ration aid among the civilians on the other side, it is against everything we stand for,\" he stressed. Meanwhile, the UN's Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), said the Israeli scheme \"will mean large parts of Gaza, including the less mobile and most vulnerable people, will continue to go without supplies.\" A defence official has also briefed Associated Press, saying that the new plan to intensify the assault on Gaza wouldn't begin until after Donald Trump wraps up his expected visit to the Middle East this month -- allowing for the possibility that Israel might agree to a ceasefire in the meantime. It is not clear if this is the same official who has briefed Reuters (see our previous post). A senior Israeli defence official said on Monday there was a \"window of opportunity\" for a hostage deal in Gaza during US President Donald Trump's visit to the region next week. However, Reuters reports, if no deal is agreed Israel would begin its new operation in the enclave. \"If there is no hostage deal, Operation 'Gideon Chariots' will begin with great intensity and will not stop until all its goals are achieved,\" he said, following a decision by the security cabinet to approve an expanded operation. Israel is to expand its military operations in Gaza in the coming weeks, with the aim of \"conquering\" the territory and establishing a \"sustained presence\" there, Israeli officials have said. The plan, which was unanimously approved at a security cabinet meeting late on Sunday, goes beyond any aims so far outlined by Israel for its offensive in the devastated Palestinian territory and is likely to prompt deep international concern and fierce opposition. Officials told reporters in Israel that the plan would involve a new and intense offensive leading to \"the conquest of Gaza and the holding of the territories, moving the Gaza population south for their protection [and] ... powerful blows against Hamas\". After a fragile ceasefire collapsed in mid-March, Israel renewed its bombardment of Gaza, with troops reinforcing kilometre-deep \"buffer zones\" along the perimeter of Gaza and expanding their hold over much of the north and south of the territory. The European Union has called for restraint from Israel after the country's security cabinet approved the expansion of military operations in Gaza. \"The European Union is concerned at the planned extension of the operation by Israeli forces in Gaza, which will result in further casualties and suffering for the Palestinian population. We urge Israel to exercise the utmost restraint,\" EU spokesman Anouar El Anouni said. AP provides some analysis of Israel's new plan to expand its operations in Gaza - and potentially capture the entire territory. The new plan, which two officials said was meant to help Israel achieve its war aims of defeating Hamas and freeing hostages held in Gaza, also calls for hundreds of thousands of Palestinians to move to Gaza's south -- which would likely lead to their forcible displacement and exacerbate an already dire humanitarian crisis. Israel withdrew from Gaza in 2005 after a decades-long occupation and then imposed a blockade on the territory along with Egypt. Capturing and potentially occupying the territory again for an indefinite period would not only further dash hopes for Palestinian statehood, it would embed Israel inside a population that is deeply hostile to it and raise questions about how Israel plans to govern the territory, especially at a time when it is considering how to implement US president Donald Trump's vision to take over Gaza. The Israel Defence Forces said a strike on Gaza's Khan Younis yesterday destroyed a Hamas rocket position. The IDF posted a video of the strike on X. It said secondary explosions in the clip indicated \"the presence of rockets prepared for launch toward Israeli territory\". The Guardian could not independently verify the footage or the IDF's claim it had destroyed a Hamas position. Overnight attacks on the Khan Younis refugee camp killed at least 11 people including three babies up to a year old, Gazan officials said. It is not clear if the strike in the IDF footage is related to these casualties. Israel will not withdraw from the Gaza Strip even if there is another hostage deal is reached, far-right finance minister Bezalel Smotrich has insisted as he called on Israelis to embrace the word \"occupation.\" \"We are finally going to occupy the Gaza Strip. We will stop being afraid of the word 'occupation,'\" Smotrich told Channel 12 journalist Amit Segal during a conference organised by Israel's right-wing Besheva newspaper. \"We are finally taking control of all humanitarian aid, so that it does not become supplies for Hamas. We are separating Hamas from the population, cleansing the Strip, returning the hostages -- and defeating Hamas,\" he said. \"The only way to release the hostages is to subdue Hamas. Any retreat will bring about the next October 7,\" he said. \"Once as we occupy and stay [in Gaza] we can talk about sovereignty. But I did not demand that this be included among the goals of the war. First, we will defeat Hamas and prevent it from existing.\" AFP provides some more detail on Israel's plans to intensify its operations in Gaza, with the official saying Israel was planning the \"conquest\" of the territory. The Israeli official said the plan for expanded operations \"will include, among other things, the conquest of the Gaza Strip and the holding of the territories, moving the Gaza population south for their protection\". The majority of Gaza's population had resided in the north of the territory, particularly Gaza City, and nearly all have been displaced at least once since the war began. The cabinet, which includes prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu and several ministers, \"unanimously approved\" the plan aimed at defeating Gaza's rulers Hamas and securing the return of hostages held in the territory. The official source said the plan included \"powerful strikes against Hamas\", without specifying their nature. One of Pope Francis's popemobiles is being transformed into a mobile health clinic for children in the Gaza Strip, fulfilling one of his final wishes, the Vatican said yesterday. The vehicle, used by the late pontiff during his 2014 visit to the Holy Land, is being outfitted with diagnostic and emergency medical equipment to help young patients in the Palestinian territory, where health services have been devastated by the Israeli invasion. Israel's expansion announcement has angered families of hostages still trapped in Gaza, AP reports. The Hostage Forum, which supports families, said that the plan puts every hostage at risk and urged Israel's decision-makers to secure a deal and prioritise the hostages. At a Knesset committee meeting, Einav Zangauker, whose son Matan is being held hostage, called on soldiers \"not to report for reserve duty for moral and ethical reasons.\" The Israeli military said the army was calling up tens of thousands of reserve soldiers shortly before it emerged that Israeli ministers had approved a plan to potentially capture all of Gaza. Hamas said a new Israeli framework for aid delivery in Gaza amounted to \"political blackmail\" and blamed Israel for the war-ravaged territory's \"humanitarian catastrophe\", AFP reports. \"We reject the use of aid as a tool of political blackmail and support the UN's stance against any arrangements that violate humanitarian principles,\" Hamas said in a statement, adding Israel's \"continued obstruction of aid entry\" since 2 March made it \"fully responsible\" for the \"humanitarian catastrophe\" in Gaza. One of Israel's goals is to prevent Hamas from handling aid in the Gaza Strip, AP reports. The Israeli officials who confirmed Israel's plans to potentially capture all of Gaza, did not disclose details on how the plan seeks to prevent Hamas from involvement in aid distribution. One said the ministers had approved \"the option of aid distribution,\" without elaborating. According to an internal memo circulated among aid groups and seen by AP, Israel told the UN that it will use private security companies to control aid distribution in Gaza. The UN, in a statement yesterday, said it would not participate in the plan as presented, saying it violates its core principles. The memo, sent to aid organisations, detailed notes from a meeting between COGAT, the Israeli defence body in charge of coordinating aid to Gaza, and the UN. Under COGAT's plan, all aid will enter Gaza through the Kerem Shalom crossing, letting approximately 60 trucks enter daily and distributing 20kg of aid parcels directly to people on the day of entry. The memo said the aid will be distributed at logistics hubs, which will be run by private security companies. The memo said that facial recognition will be used to identify Palestinians at the hubs and SMS alerts will notify people in the area that they can collect aid. Aid workers say the plan to centralise aid, rather than delivering it to Palestinians where they are, will forcibly displace people. Yemen's Houthis have said the US of carried out strikes in and around Sana'a, after the Iran-backed rebels claimed a missile strike on Israel's main airport yesterday, AFP reports. The Houthi-run Saba news agency said the strikes included two on Arbaeen Street in the capital and the airport road, blaming them on \"American aggression\". Saba said 16 people were wounded, citing the Houthi's health ministry. Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed a tough response against the Houthis, as well as its main backer Iran, over the airport attack. On social media platform X, Netanyahu said Israel would also respond to Iran at \"a time and place of our choosing\". Iran denied supporting the attack, calling it an \"independent decision\" by the Yemeni rebels taken in solidarity with the Palestinian people. As news of Israel's plans to for a renewed assault on the Gaza Strip emerge, Gaza rescuers said Israeli air strikes killed at least 19 people in the north overnight, AFP reports. Israel resumed major operations across Gaza on 18 March amid deadlock over how to proceed with a two-month ceasefire that had largely halted the war with Hamas, which was sparked by the militants' October 2023 attack on Israel. The health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza said yesterday that at least 2,436 people had been killed since Israel resumed its campaign in March, bringing the overall death toll from the war to 52,535. An Israeli campaign group said that a new government plan for expanded military operations in Gaza is \"sacrificing\" hostages held in the Palestinian territory, AFP reports. \"The plan approved by the cabinet deserves to be called the 'Smotrich-Netanyahu Plan' for sacrificing the hostages,\" the Hostages and Missing Families Forum said in a statement on the plan adopted by Israel's security cabinet. The reference was to far-right finance minister Bezalel Smotrich and prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu. A report by Israel's public broadcaster Kan, citing officials with knowledge of the details, said new plan to intensify operations in the Gaza Strip would be gradual and would take months, with forces focusing first on one area, Reuters reports. Such a timeline could leave the door open for a ceasefire and hostage release deal talks ahead of a visit by US president Donald Trump to the region next week, according to security cabinet minister Zeev Elkin. \"There is still a window of opportunity until president Trump concludes his visit to the Middle East, if Hamas understands we are serious,\" Elkin told Kan. Israel's security cabinet approved a plan to capture all of the Gaza Strip and remain there for an unspecified amount of time, two officials said, AP reports. The plan was approved today and is part of Israel's efforts to increase pressure on Hamas to free hostages and negotiate a ceasefire on Israel's terms. The two officials said the plan also includes the displacement of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians to southern Gaza. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were discussing military plans. Israeli ministers on Monday agreed to ramp up the war against Hamas in Gaza, an official said. Associated Press reported Israel has plans to capture more territory in the beleaguered Palestinian territory and call up tens of thousands of reserve soldiers. The plan, which the official said would be gradual, could mark a significant escalation in the fighting in Gaza, which resumed in mid-March after Israel and Hamas failed to agree on an extension to an eight-week truce. The official spoke on condition of anonymity in line with regulations. On Sunday, Israel's military chief of staff, Lt Gen Eyal Zamir, said the army was calling up tens of thousands of reserve soldiers and said Israel would \"operate in additional areas\" in Gaza and continue to strike militant infrastructure. Israel already controls roughly half of Gaza's territory, including a buffer zone along the border with Israel as well as three corridors that run east-west along the strip. These have squeezed war-weary Palestinians into ever shrinking wedges of land in the devastated territory. We will bring you more developments as we have them.",
      "ml_hf_summary": "This is a very detailed news summary about the escalating conflict between Israel and Hamas in Gaza. Here are some key takeaways:\n\n**Israel's Plans:**\n\n* **Capture of Gaza:** Israel's security cabinet has approved a plan to capture all of Gaza and occupy it indefinitely. This would involve displacing hundreds of thousands of Palestinians to southern Gaza.\n* **Military Escalation:** Israel plans to intensify its military operations against Hamas, calling up tens of thousands of reserve soldiers and expanding its control over Gaza territory. \n* **Control Over Aid Distribution:** Israel aims to prevent Hamas from handling aid distribution in Gaza, proposing a plan that involves private security companies controlling the flow of aid through centralized hubs. The UN has rejected this plan as it violates humanitarian principles.\n\n**Hamas Response:**\n\n* **Rejection of Aid Plan:** Hamas condemned Israel's plan for aid distribution as \"political blackmail\" and blamed Israel for the humanitarian crisis in Gaza.\n* **Continued Fighting:** Hamas continues to fight back against Israeli attacks, launching rockets into Israel and engaging in ground fighting.\n\n**International Reactions:**\n\n* **US Involvement:** US President Donald Trump is expected to visit the region next week, potentially offering a window of opportunity for a ceasefire and hostage release deal. \n* **UN Concerns:** The UN has expressed concern over Israel's plans for Gaza, particularly the control over aid distribution and potential displacement of Palestinians.\n\n**Humanitarian Crisis:**\n\n* **Civilian Casualties:**  The conflict continues to take a heavy toll on civilians in Gaza, with at least 2,436 people killed since March.\n* **Displacement:** The ongoing fighting has displaced hundreds of thousands of Palestinians within Gaza.\n\n\nThis situation is highly volatile and rapidly evolving. It's important to stay informed about the latest developments from reliable news sources."

      "content": "A frantic search for two children presumed lost in the unforgiving and thickly forested lands of Nova Scotia has entered its fourth day as police in Atlantic Canada expand their search. Nearly 150 searchers have braved rain and fog to track down Lily Sullivan, six, and Jack Sullivan, four, who were last seen on Friday around their home in Pictou county, 100 miles north-east of Halifax. Their mother Malehya Brooks-Murray and stepfather, Daniel Martell, have told local media they were sleeping with their 16-month-old baby on Friday morning as the older children played in the house. But when they awoke later in the morning, the two children were gone. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police believe the pair, members of the Mi'kmaq First Nation community of Sipekne'katik, wandered off from their home and probably entered a heavily forested area. Among the resources devoted to the effort have been dog teams with the heavy urban search and rescue team from Halifax, the region's largest city, as well as thermal imaging cameras attached to drones. Police say their work has been \"strategic and thorough\" as they weigh any clues that might suggest a likely whereabouts for the children. The search is also the first major undertaking by the Nova Scotia Guard, a newly formed a volunteer emergency organization meant to address shortfalls in the province's response to crisis. In 2023, a flash flood killed four people, including three children - a tragedy that some residents believe could have been avoided by timely warnings sent by authorities. Nova Scotia's premier, Tim Houston, a resident of Pictou county, has visited the search headquarters alongside other local officials, to offer support for residents and searchers. \"People in Pictou County and across Nova Scotia are praying for a positive outcome for two missing children,\" he said in a statement. \"During this time of worry, please know that our first responders and volunteers are working tirelessly during this 24/7 operation.\" Foiled at times by inclement weather, more than a dozen search teams are in the field. \"Everybody in the community is concerned and worried, but we're all hoping for the best here,\" said Donald Parker, a municipal councillor with the municipality of Pictou county told CBC News. \"It's hard on the whole community ... It's incredibly tough.\" On social media, the Sipekne'katik chief, Michelle Glasgow, questioned the decision not to issue an Amber alert, used when a child is presumed abducted, and said the disappearance underscored the need for a national alerting system. \"Please help bring Jack and Lily home,\" she wrote.",

      "summary": "Residents at street parties highlight importance of commemorating those who died in second world war",
      "content": "It's lunchtime in Manchester, and neighbours spanning three generations in Chorlton are celebrating VE Day with music, union jack hats and England's favourite delicacy: the sausage roll. It is one of 20 street parties happening across the city on bank holiday Monday to mark the day when the allies formally accepted Germany's surrender in 1945. If you can ignore the sound of Lady Gaga in the background the sight of children running freely on the road in between tables laid out with cake and red-white-and-blue flags is reminiscent of spring 1945. Carol Wilkinson, 67, sporting a dress with union jacks, spent the morning cooking for the party. She believes the celebration is particularly significant in teaching young people about the sacrifice made by those in the war. She says: \"You've got to remember we wouldn't be here if those people had not done what they've done for us. And I think unfortunately with the younger generation, it's not something they're really taught a lot about in school. I know they learn about world wars, but they don't really know about the sacrifice people made.\" Her husband, David Wilkinson, 73, a retired butcher who has lived on the street for 50 years, echoes a similar sentiment. He says: \"It's so important to remember all the people that have fought for this country, and a lot of them lost their lives. And to be fair, people on both sides, the Germans as well, they lost an awful lot of people. Wilkinson, whose father was in the Black Watch regiment, added: \"I think everyone should think about everyone. The war shouldn't have happened really, but unfortunately it did.\" Gareth Mulreid, 45, who is visiting his parents on the street, believes occasions like this are becoming more important as time goes on. He says: \"Now it's getting older I'm realising we are going to get to a stage now where there won't be anyone left from world war two. \"I was born in 1980 - 35 years after world war two, which seems like not a long time really, in hindsight. So it's a bit of a crazy thing to think it was that close to when I was born. It's hard to imagine, but these people laid down their lives for people to be free today. Bev Craig, leader of Manchester city council, says: \"As the decades go on and the second world war moves further from living memory, it makes it more important than ever that younger generations learn the lessons of history and keep alive the spirit of those who served our country. \"This is why we have been keen as a council to encourage and facilitate street parties, community events and celebrations not just today but across the summer. From our planned civic commemorations to events in schools to today's street parties, it's great to see so many communities coming together to celebrate all that's good about modern Manchester - that is what Manchester is all about.\" Just up the road from Chorlton, in Moss Side, Wendy Simms, founder of the charity Keeping it Real 24/7, is hosting her own VE Day party. But in place of union jacks, a colourful collection of flags from all over the world are hung across a marquee. Simms, 59, was inspired to host a party to commemorate black service personnel who lost their lives in the war. It is part of the war's history that she feels is often neglected. She says: \"Personally, especially coming from the Caribbean, I believe black people have not been recognised in the war. \"I didn't want to do VE Day, but this gave me an opportunity to say: 'You know what, here's my people and what they died for.' Let's go out and celebrate that day, the families and everything that happened with them.\"",

      "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/05/israel-expand-military-operations-gaza",
      "published": "2025-05-05",
      "summary": "Israeli PM says operation will lead to<strong> </strong>significant displacement of the population ‘for its own protection’",
      "content": "Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel's prime minister, has said a new \"intensified\" offensive in Gaza will involve Israeli troops holding on to seized territory and significant displacement of the population. Speaking after officials said Israel's security cabinet had approved a plan for \"conquering\" the Gaza Strip and establishing a \"sustained presence\" there, Netanyahu posted a video on X in which he said Israeli soldiers would not go into Gaza, launch raids and then retreat. \"The intention is the opposite of that,\" he said. \"Population will be moved, for its own protection.\" Brig Gen Efi Dufferin, the chief Israeli military spokesperson, said in a statement shortly afterwards that Operation Gideon's Chariots, as the new offensive has been named, would \"include a wide-scale attack and the movement of the majority of the strip's population, this is to protect them in an area sterile of Hamas. And continued airstrikes, elimination of terrorists, and dismantling of infrastructure.\" The plan, which was unanimously approved at a security cabinet meeting late on Sunday, goes beyond any aims so far outlined by Israel for its offensive in the devastated Palestinian territory and is likely to prompt deep international concern and fierce opposition. \"This will inevitably lead to countless more civilians killed and the further destruction of Gaza,\" said a spokesperson for Antonio Guterres, the United Nations secretary general. \"Gaza is, and must remain, an integral part of a future Palestinian state.\" A spokesperson for the British Foreign Office said: \"The UK does not support an expansion of Israel's military operations in Gaza. Continued fighting is in nobody's interests.\" After a fragile ceasefire collapsed in mid-March, Israel renewed its bombardment, with troops reinforcing kilometre-deep \"buffer zones\" along the perimeter of the territory and expanding their hold over much of the north and south of the strip. In all, more than 70% of Gaza is under Israeli control or covered by orders issued by Israel telling Palestinian civilians to evacuate specific neighbourhoods. On Sunday, the army chief, Lt Gen Eyal Zamir, said the military was calling up tens of thousands of reservists to allow for conscripted regular troops to be deployed to Gaza for the new offensive. Zamir has resisted calls by some Israeli ministers for the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) to take on the job of distributing aid in Gaza, which has been under a tight blockade by Israel for more than two months. Much of the 2.3 million population can no longer find enough to eat and the humanitarian system is close to collapse, aid officials in the territory have said. Israeli officials told local media that ministers believed there was \"currently enough food\" in the territory, but that they approved \"the possibility of a humanitarian distribution, if necessary, to prevent Hamas from taking control of the supplies and to destroy its governance capabilities\". Israel says the blockade and intensified bombardments since mid-March are to put pressure on Hamas to release hostages held in Gaza. Militants in the territory still hold 58 hostages seized in Hamas's October 2023 attack on Israel, which resulted in the deaths of about 1,200 people, mostly civilians. Israel's retaliatory military offensive has killed at least 52,535 people in Gaza, the majority of them civilians, according to the health ministry there. The officials also said Netanyahu \"continues to promote\" a proposal made in January by Donald Trump to displace the millions of Palestinians living in Gaza to neighbouring countries such as Jordan or Egypt, to allow its reconstruction. A \"voluntary transfer programme for Gaza residents ... will be part of the operation's goals\", the senior security official said. Israel's military on Monday carried out a fresh round of airstrikes against Houthi rebels in Yemen's Red Sea city of Hodeida, a day after the Iranian-backed rebels launched a missile that hit Israel's main airport. The rebels' media office said at least six strikes hit the crucial Hodeida port Monday afternoon. Other strikes hit a cement factory in the Bajil district in Hodeida province, the rebels said. Israeli media reported that dozens of Israeli air force took part in the operation. Trump's scheduled visit later this month to Saudi Arabia, Qatar and UAE may provide an additional incentive to the Israeli government to conclude a new ceasefire deal and allow aid into Gaza. Trump, who recently said he wanted Netanyahu to be \"good to Gaza\", is likely to come under pressure from his hosts to push Israel to make concessions to end the conflict. Israeli military officials say seizing territory provides Israel with additional leverage in its negotiations with Hamas, and some observers suggest that the public announcement of the new offensive and plans for a longer-term presence in Gaza are merely aimed at putting pressure on the militant Islamist group. Humanitarian organisations have unanimously rejected Israel's plan to establish a limited number of aid distribution hubs run by private contractors and guarded by the IDF in southern Gaza. The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) on Sunday accused Israel of trying to shut down the existing aid distribution system run by the UN and its humanitarian partners in order to impose its own supply system. \"[This] contravenes fundamental humanitarian principles ... It is dangerous, driving civilians into militarised zones to collect rations, threatening lives ... while further entrenching forced displacement,\" OCHA said. Hamas on Monday described the new Israeli framework for aid delivery in Gaza as \"political blackmail\" and blamed Israel for the war-ravaged territory's \"humanitarian catastrophe\". In Israel, hundreds of protesters took to the streets in Jerusalem while a coalition representing the majority of families of hostages held by Hamas, about half of whom are thought to be dead, condemned the planned new offensive as a threat the lives of hostages and Israeli soldiers. Netanyahu's governing coalition - and so his hold on power - depends heavily on the support of hardline rightwing parties that have long demanded the reoccupation and resettlement of Gaza, which Israel formally left in 2005. A new parliamentary session opened on Monday. Israeli strikes across Gaza continued overnight and during Monday, killing at least 32 people in the territory, according to hospital staff. Strikes hit Gaza City, Beit Hanoun and Beit Lahiya and among the dead were eight women and children, according to staff at al-Shifa hospital, where the bodies were brought.",

The plan involves Israeli troops holding onto seized territory, displacing the majority of Gaza's population for their \"protection,\" and continuing airstrikes against Hamas targets. This escalation goes beyond previous objectives and has drawn international concern, with the UN Secretary-General expressing alarm over potential civilian casualties and further destruction.  The offensive follows a collapsed ceasefire in mid-March and involves calling up tens of thousands of Israeli reservists. Israel claims the operation aims to pressure Hamas into releasing hostages seized during their October 2023 attack on Israel, which resulted in significant casualties on both sides.  \n\n\n"

      "summary": "Marcel Ciolacu quits after coalition candidate fails to make it to run-off against nationalist George Simion",
      "content": "Romania's pro-EU prime minister, Marcel Ciolacu, has resigned after his ruling coalition's candidate crashed out of a presidential election rerun decisively won by a far-right Trump admirer, dramatically deepening the country's political turmoil. \"Rather than let the future president replace me, I decided to resign myself,\" Ciolacu, told reporters after a meeting at the headquarters of his Social Democratic party (PSD). \"The ruling coalition has no legitimacy, at least in this formula.\" Ciolacu said the PSD would withdraw from the pro-western coalition - effectively ending it - while cabinet ministers will stay on in an interim capacity until a new majority can be negotiated after the presidential run-off on 18 May. Sunday's first-round vote was convincingly won by ultranationalist George Simion, 38, who sports Maga caps, pushes a socially conservative agenda and has called for the \"Melonisation\" - referring to Italy's far-right prime minister - of Europe. Simion's score of 40.96% was almost double that of the second-placed finisher, the Bucharest mayor Nicusor Dan. The two will face each other in a runoff that raises the prospect of another disruptive nationalist joining the EU leaders' club. The coalition candidate, Crin Antonescu, finished third in a bitter blow to the government, formed after December elections by the leftist PSD, the centrist Liberals and ethnic Hungarian UDMR to keep the EU and Nato member on a pro-western track. Simion's Alliance for the Union of Romanians (AUR) and two other sovereignist parties won more than a third of parliamentary seats, and forming a new majority without the far-right bloc will be hard - even more so if Simion is elected president. A Simion victory - and a likely change of government - could lead to Romania, which shares a border with Ukraine, veering away from the mainstream and becoming another disruptive force within the EU alongside Hungary and Slovakia. It would also be welcomed by conservative nationalists in Europe and beyond - including senior Trump administration figures such as the US vice-president, JD Vance - who accused Bucharest of denying democracy after the original ballot was cancelled. \"The problem now isn't that Romania is in a hard place, but that the EU is, should George Simion win,\" said the political scientist Cristian Pirvulescu. \"The anti-European group within the EU will become more substantial.\" The French far-right leader Marine Le Pen said Romania's voters had sent \"a very nice boomerang\" to the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, echoing claims Brussels was behind the cancellation of the original vote last year. Simion said after the result that his win was \"not just an electoral victory, it is a victory of Romanian dignity. It is the victory of those who have not lost hope, of those who still believe in Romania, a free, respected, sovereign country.\" The far-right candidate added: \"I am here to serve Romanians, not the other way around. He said he believed in an EU \"that thrives as a nest for its diverse and sovereign nations - not as a rigid system enforcing one-size-fits-all policies\". Simion, whose AUR has grown from an anti-vax movement into the country's second-largest party, finished first in 36 of 47 electoral districts and secured 61% of the large overseas vote. Dan, a 55-year-old mathematician who founded the Save Romania Union party (USR) and campaigned as a pro-EU, anti-corruption independent, called the runoff a battle \"to convince Romanians that Romania needs its pro-western direction\". He said the two weeks leading up to the runoff would be \"difficult against this isolationist candidate ... It will not be a debate between individuals, it will be a debate between a pro-western direction for Romania and an anti-western direction\". Experts have said Dan may struggle to beat Simion in the runoff because of side agreements between the independent candidate and the mainstream PSD and Liberal parties that could easily deter their voters from switching allegiance. Romania's president has a semi-executive role with considerable powers over foreign policy, national security, defence spending and judicial appointments. They also represent the country on the international stage and can veto important EU votes. That vote last November was won by Calin Georgescu, a far-right, Moscow-friendly independent, but was annulled by Romania's top court after declassified intelligence documents revealed an alleged Russian influence operation. Georgescu, who denies any wrongdoing, was later placed under investigation on counts including misreporting campaign finances, misuse of digital technology and promoting fascist groups. In March, he was barred from standing in the rerun. Simion promised on Sunday to make Georgescu prime minister, either through a referendum, early elections or forming a new government coalition, if he won. Simion denies his policies are far-right but has described his party as \"natural allies\" of Trump and promised an alliance of EU countries \"in the spirit of Maga\". He has frequently criticised Russia, but consistently opposed military aid to Ukraine.",
      "ml_hf_summary": "On May 14, 2023, Romanian ultranationalist George Simion won the first round of the presidential election with 40.96% of the vote, significantly defeating the pro-EU coalition candidate Crin Antonescu.

Following Simion's victory, Prime Minister Marcel Ciolacu resigned, stating the ruling coalition lacked legitimacy and would withdraw from the pro-western alliance.  Simion's potential presidency could shift Romania away from its pro-Western stance, aligning it with Hungary and Slovakia as disruptive forces within the EU. \n\n\n"

      "summary": "Sheinbaum emphasises communication with Trump ‘very good’ after rejecting offer to send US troops into Mexico",
      "content": "A sharp exchange of statements over the weekend has heightened concerns in Mexico that Donald Trump may push for a US military presence in its territory to fight drug trafficking. The Mexican president, Claudia Sheinbaum, sought to defuse the situation in her daily press conference on Monday, emphasising that communication between the two leaders had been \"very good\" so far. But the episode underlined the fraught path that Sheinbaum is navigating, as she attempts to placate Trump and protect the US-Mexico trade relationship while also defending Mexican sovereignty. On Saturday, Sheinbaum revealed she had rejected an offer from Trump during a call last week to send US troops into Mexico to help fight drug trafficking. \"I told him, 'No, President Trump, our territory is inviolable, our sovereignty is inviolable,'\" said Sheinbaum, adding that while the two countries can collaborate, \"we will never accept the presence of the US army in our territory\". Trump on Sunday confirmed he had made the offer to Sheinbaum, because the cartels \"are horrible people that have been killing people left and right and have been - they've made a fortune on selling drugs and destroying our people\". \"The president of Mexico is a lovely woman, but she is so afraid of the cartels that she can't even think straight,\" added Trump. Despite the exchange over the weekend, the public relationship between Trump and Sheinbaum has been largely cordial, with many comparing Sheinbaum's performance favourably against other world leaders who have clashed with the US president. The US-Mexico relationship is complex and vastly important for both countries, spanning trade, migration and security. Since returning to power in January, Trump has imposed various tariff schemes that have jeopardised the free trade agreement between the two countries and the near trillion dollars of trade a year that passes between them. Trump directly linked some of those tariffs to reducing the movement of undocumented migrants and fentanyl across the border into the US, and Sheinbaum's cabinet has been engaged in intense diplomatic efforts to persuade him to withdraw them. Sheinbaum first sent 10,000 additional troops to the border, then Mexico sent 29 high-level organised crime operatives to face justice in the US, including Rafael Caro Quintero, the drug lord who was convicted of the murder of an undercover US Drug Enforcement Administration agent in 1985. Meanwhile Sheinbaum has abandoned the hands-off security strategy of her predecessor and ally, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, and ramped up direct confrontation of organised crime groups, with soaring arrests and seizures of drugs and guns. \"Trump has created a real pressure that's forced Mexico to act,\" said Will Freeman from the Council on Foreign Relations, a US-based thinktank. \"I think Sheinbaum wants to act anyway, but it's made her job easier by putting this pressure behind her. \"I think Trump's vision is that this is almost like an insurgency in Mexico,\" added Freeman. \"And if the Mexican military is not willing to fight it - and they do often seem to be less than willing to use their full force against the cartels - then the US should do it.\" But experts say it is unclear that greater military action would fundamentally address the problem of organised crime in Mexico. \"I think to really change the balance of power between organised crime and the state in Mexico, you need intelligence, you need accountability through the justice system, you need political will,\" said Freeman. Still, Trump has said that the US could use unilateral military action if Mexico does not do enough to dismantle the cartels. Sheinbaum has warned that her country would not tolerate an \"invasion\" of its national sovereignty by US forces. \"But the Mexican government should not just assume that [unilateral military action] couldn't happen, regardless of how bad an idea it would be on many levels,\" said Cecilia Farfan-Mendez, from the Global Initiative against Transnational Organised Crime, an NGO. \"All scenarios should be planned for.\"",
      "ml_hf_summary": "On Saturday, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum rejected a proposal from US President Donald Trump to deploy US troops in Mexico to combat drug trafficking.

The US-Mexico relationship is complex, involving trade, migration, and security, and has been strained by Trump's tariff schemes aimed at reducing undocumented migration and fentanyl trafficking.  Sheinbaum has responded to pressure from Trump by increasing military presence at the border and collaborating with the US in apprehending high-level cartel members. \n\n\n"

      "published": "2025-05-05",
      "summary": "By going public now Benjamin Netanyahu hopes to squeeze Hamas for concessions and please the far right",
      "content": "The announcement of Israel's plan to launch imminently a new, expanded offensive in Gaza and to retain the territory it seized is a significant moment, at least in terms of public rhetoric. Throughout the nearly 19-month war, Israeli troops have carried out large and frequently bloody operations that have covered all except central parts of Gaza, but they have largely restricted their permanent presence to a buffer zone about 1km deep along the devastated territory's perimeter and two relatively narrow east-west corridors. This now seems to have changed. Once \"Operation Gideon's Chariots\" is under way, Israel will send its troops across much - if not all - of Gaza, and will seek to establish a \"sustained presence\" there, Israel officials said. Israeli officials are also talking openly about the displacement of Palestinians to southern Gaza, and their potential \"voluntary\" displacement from the territory altogether to allow the implementation of the reconstruction plan announced by the US president, Donald Trump, in January. The far-right Israeli finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, told Israelis on Monday to embrace the word \"occupation\". All this will confirm many people's long-held fears of Israel's intentions in Gaza and prompt international outrage. The idea of a major new offensive in Gaza has been discussed and debated within the government and the upper ranks of the military for some months. So why has Israel's government announced this plan so loudly? And why now? A key factor is the indirect talks being held with Hamas about a new ceasefire. The government of the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, hopes that the Israel Defense Forces' call-up of tens of thousands of reservists, the threat of the new offensive and the prospect of Israel seizing swaths of territory will force Hamas's leaders to make concessions. If it fails to do so, then physical possession of terrain will offer useful leverage in future negotiations and allow Hamas to be squeezed further in the meantime. Israel's twin war aims - to crush Hamas and free the 59 hostages it still holds - remain unchanged, though Netanyahu has signaled the former is the priority. Trump is due to visit the Middle East in 10 days, and Israeli officials said the offensive would start after the leader of their country's most important ally had enjoyed the hospitality of Saudi Arabia, UAE and Qatar. Images of destruction and death from Gaza would make the president's stay that much more diplomatically delicate. In reality, the complex logistics necessary to move and mobilise additional troops in Israel is likely to mean an even longer delay. Israel has also now gone public with its plan to allow some aid into Gaza, which has been brought to \"the brink of catastrophe\", aid officials say, by two months of Israel's tight blockade of food, fuel, medicine and everything else. The scheme involves creating big distribution sites run by private contractors in the south of Gaza, to which vetted representatives of each Palestinian family would travel to pick up food parcels. Israeli troops would guard the bases, likely to be situated in a vast zone up to 5km wide now being cleared along the border with Egypt. The scheme has been dismissed as unworkable, dangerous and potentially illegal under international law by leading humanitarian organisations. There has been no mention either of who might provide healthcare, sanitation, water, fuel and everything else necessary for life in the territory. Policy papers outlining and advocating the imposition of a military administration on Gaza have been circulating among senior officials in Israel for more than a year. Netanyahu continues to dismiss out of hand the possibility of the Palestinian Authority, which exercises partial authority in the occupied West Bank, governing the territory. Nor has he outlined any other kind of future political settlement in Gaza. The likely result, should the new offensive go ahead, would be that Israeli troops end up the de facto rulers of much of Gaza and its 2.3 million inhabitants. The Israeli prime minister also offers little to the majority of Israelis who call for a ceasefire deal to secure the release of the hostages. His coalition still depends heavily on the support of far-right parties who are very happy with the prospect of the new offensive and the prospect of a \"sustained\" Israeli presence in Gaza. Netanyahu now appears likely to remain in power for the 15 months or so until the next elections. More than 1,200 people died, mostly civilians, in the Hamas surprise raid into Israel in 2023 that triggered the war, and about 250 were taken prisoner, of whom 58 remain in Gaza. More than 52,000 Palestinians, mostly civilians, have died in the Israeli offensive there which followed. On Monday - among all the outrage and enthusiasm generated by Operation Gideon's Chariots - the announcement that Israel's security cabinet had decided not to establish \"at this time\" a state commission of inquiry into the failures that allowed that attack to take place went almost unnoticed. Any inquiry should wait until the war has ended, Netanyahu told Israelis.",
      "ml_hf_summary": "Israel announced its plan to launch \"Operation Gideon's Chariots,\" a large-scale offensive in Gaza with the aim of establishing a sustained military presence throughout the territory. This announcement follows nearly 19 months of conflict and comes amidst indirect talks with Hamas regarding a new ceasefire. Israel hopes that the threat of this offensive will pressure Hamas into concessions, potentially including the release of 58 hostages still held in Gaza. The operation is expected to involve the displacement of Palestinians and the creation of aid distribution sites controlled by Israeli troops, a plan criticized by humanitarian organizations as unworkable and potentially illegal.  The Israeli government has not outlined any future political settlement for Gaza beyond military control. \n\n\n"

      "content": "Thank you for reading today's live blog on the UK marking the 80th anniversary of VE Day. This blog will be closing shortly but you can see all the Guardian's VE Day coverage here. Here is our main story from today: Plus, here is a summary of the day's events: Senior royals joined thousands of people in London to observe a military procession and RAF flypast that began a series of commemorations marking the end of the second world war in Europe. King Charles and Queen Camilla were joined in the royal box by the Prince and Princess of Wales and their children Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis to watch the procession. They later watched the RAF flypast, including a display by the Red Arrows, from the Buckingham Palace balcony. Afterwards, a tea party for 30 second world war veterans aged from 98 to 104, and about 20 evacuees and others who lived through the war, was hosted by the king and queen at the palace. Nato allies joined 1,300 members of the UK armed forces for the parade, with the words of Winston Churchill's 1945 victory speech spoken by actor Timothy Spall kicking off events for the 80th anniversary of VE Day. In Whitehall, the Cenotaph was draped in a large union flag, with the south and north face of the landmark covered. It was the first time the war memorial had been draped in union flags since it was unveiled by King George V more than a century ago, in 1920. Crowds started to gather on the Mall on Monday morning, with some arriving the day before to secure a viewing spot. The commemorations featured displays by the Red Arrows and street parties took place across the UK. Keir Starmer, who was also at the London procession, said the week's events were a reminder that victory was \"not just for Britain\" as personnel from the US, France and Germany joined the military procession. In an open letter to veterans, he said: \"VE Day is a chance to acknowledge, again, that our debt to those who achieved it can never fully be repaid.\" Starmer was greeted with applause from guests as he joined the VE Day street party in Downing Street after the parade. The prime minister, joined by his wife, Victoria, walked out of No 10 holding a plate of cakes, which he then handed out to some of the guests. Starmer then picked up a commemorative teapot and walked around the tables to serve tea before taking his seat. Alan Kennett, a 100-year-old Normandy veteran, began the military procession which set off down Whitehall, through Admiralty Arch and up the Mall towards Buckingham Palace. The procession officially began shortly after midday when Kennett received the Commonwealth War Graves' Torch For Peace by air cadet Warrant Officer Emmy Jones. Thirty further veterans attended official events on Monday, including 26 who watched the procession in London. Representatives of the Ukrainian military, selected from the UK armed forces' training programme for Ukrainian recruits, also took part in Monday's military procession, receiving cheers and applause from the crowds gathered. The Nato detachment, which included personnel from Poland, Lithuania and Sweden, marched in the procession wearing the uniforms of their nations under the Nato flag. The royal family are scheduled to take part in engagements over the next four days. King Charles and Camilla are \"looking forward\" to the week's events, and it is understood that, out of respect for the surviving veterans, Buckingham Palace hopes \"nothing will detract or distract from celebrating with full cheer and proud hearts that precious victory and those brave souls, on this most special and poignant of anniversaries\". Here are some more images from today's commermorations for the 80th anniversary of VE Day: The Princess of Wales asked for a copy of a book written by a second world war evacuee as the royal family commemorated VE Day, the author has said. Margaret Wood was evacuated from Chingford in east London to the Midlands at the start of the war, where she remained until 23 May 1945. Wood said the Kate had asked for the book during their conversation at the Buckingham Palace tea party. She said of their encounter: I have written a book about my time as an evacuated and it was published. She asked for a copy. As Big Ben chimed at noon and with the Cenotaph, the symbol of sacrifice, draped in the union flag for the first time since its unveiling in 1920, the UK marked the 80th anniversary of VE Day with military pomp before large crowds who had gathered in central London. Buckingham Palace may have served as the centrepiece of Monday's spectacle before Thursday's anniversary of Victory in Europe Day. At the event's heart, however, were the VVIP second world war veterans, those remaining few who bore actual witness then and who today serve to remind. Back in 1945, Britain allowed itself a brief period of rejoicing on VE Day with overwhelming relief and optimism at Germany's surrender after long wartime years of deprivation and huge loss of life on all sides. On Monday, the first of four days of commemorations, tribute was paid with a 1,300-strong military procession, a flypast, marching bands, massed pipes and drums, and youth cadets. The procession set off from beneath the bronze gaze of Churchill's statue in Parliament Square and ended outside the palace. Elsewhere, street parties were held across the UK. Thousands crowded on to the Mall, many waving red, white and blue flags. Watching from a dais on the Queen Victoria Memorial were the king, queen, senior royals and the prime minister, Keir Starmer, sitting alongside those who had served in the war and who were wrapped up both in their memories and against the spring chill. As Big Ben fell silent, the actor Timothy Spall boomed aloud words from Churchill's victory speech beginning: \"My dear friends, this is your hour.\" Keir Starmer was greeted with applause from guests as he joined the VE Day street party in Downing Street. The prime minister, joined by his wife, Victoria, walked out of No 10 holding a plate of cakes, which he then handed out to some of the guests. Starmer then picked up a commemorative teapot and walked around the tables to serve tea before taking his seat. King Charles followed in his grandfather's footsteps 80 years on as he chose not to adorn his uniform with medals at the VE Day parade. Charles wore the naval No 1 dress uniform to see Monday's military procession and flypast in central London. He elected not to wear medals, reflecting the same choice made by King George VI when he stepped on to the Buckingham Palace balcony on 8 May 1945. The queen paid tribute to her family's military legacy with a 12th Royal Lancers brooch - her late father's regiment - pinned to her sapphire blue wool crepe dress and coat. Her father, Maj Bruce Shand, served with the 12th Lancers during the second world war and was awarded the Military Cross in 1940 during the retreat to Dunkirk, and again in 1942 for his efforts in north Africa, and was later wounded and taken prisoner while fighting in the same region. On Monday, the Princess of Wales also wore a brooch fit for the occasion - an RAF wings pin. Kate's grandfather served in the RAF as a fighter pilot during the second world war. The Prince of Wales was dressed in the RAF No 1 uniform. The Princess Royal wore the uniform of the First Aid Nursing Yeomanry (Princess Royal's Volunteer Corps), emulating what the late Queen Elizabeth II wore when she was a princess appearing on the palace balcony on VE Day in 1945. Members of the royal family watched the parade on Monday from a specially built platform on the Queen Victoria Memorial before making their way to Buckingham Palace's balcony to watch the flypast overhead. This year's VE Day commemorations will take on extra poignancy given the fading of the \"greatest generation\", reports Agence France-Presse (AFP). It will be the last major commemoration for which \"anyone will still be alive who actually served in the second world war,\" monarchy specialist Robert Hazell of University College London told AFP. \"It's important to remember some of the poor devils who didn't make it like I did,\" 99-year-old Royal Air Force veteran Dennis Bishop told AFP. The first part of the 80th anniversary commemorations on a chilly Monday morning in London was the draping of two huge union flags on the Cenotaph war memorial. Hundreds of people set up camp outside Buckingham Palace with chairs and rugs. \"It's so emotional to be here today. Eighty years of peace and peace of mind. Where would we be without them?\" asked Patrick Beacon, 76, who arrived with his wife at about 7am BST (6am GMT) to get the \"best view\". Tourists included 52-year-old Ludivine Batthelot from southern France. \"We came out of curiosity because it's the kind of celebration that the English do so well,\" she told AFP. \"It's folklore, we wanted to be in the mood and live the experience.\" At Buckingham Palace, the Prince of Wales told 101-year-old Alfred Littlefield his son Prince George was \"interested\" in learning about veterans, Littlefield's granddaughter says. Samantha Davidson, from Denmead in Hampshire, said: The Prince said George is very interested in finding out about the veterans. George even asked my grandfather how old he was during his service. She said that Littlefield was very happy that George has taken an interest in the past. Littlefield himself said: \"I'm very proud.\" Guests have begun to arrive for a VE Day street party hosted by the prime minister at Downing Street. Two long tables lined with red and gold chairs on the street were decorated with flowers, miniature union flags and table mats. Each seat was given a commemorative plate and mug with the words 'VE Day 80' written on them, while food served on the tables included Victoria sponge cake, scotch eggs and pork pies. Among the guests were second world war veterans Ruth Brook Klauber and Colin Deverell; both aged 101. Bunting was hanging over the tables and draped over the ground floor windows of No 10. Musicians from the Grenadier guards military band played songs to the guests as they received drinks on arrival. A new display of almost 30,000 ceramic poppies at the Tower of London is part of commemorations marking the end of the second world war in Europe. The poppies have been set to resemble a wound to reflect the long-lasting sacrifices made during the war. The poppies are on loan from the Imperial War Museum and were originally displayed as part of artist Paul Cummins ''Blood Swept Lands and Seas of Red' installation at the Tower in 2014, commemorating the centenary of the first world war. The new display, created by designer Tom Piper, is on view from 6 May until Armistice Day on 11 November. Street parties are being held in towns and cities across the UK. Local authorities have offered support for communities and organisations wishing to hold a VE Day street party, with some councils such as Portsmouth waiving fees to close roads for the celebrations. My colleague, Martin Belam, is in central London and watched the RAF flypast from Waterloo Bridge. He has shared a photograph for the live blog and this note: A sizeable crowd had gathered on Waterloo Bridge, which was on the path of the flypast. Buses stopped to let passengers see the planes go overhead, and several taxis tooted their horns to salute the flypast. Following the flypast, King Charles and Queen Camilla will host a tea party reception for about 50 veterans and members of the second world war generation at Buckingham Palace. According to the PA news agency, veterans will enjoy sandwiches, scotch eggs and scones at the tea party. Also on the menu are potted shrimps with brown bread and butter, egg and bacon quiche, vegetable pasties and sausage rolls. There will also be lemon and carrot cake, chocolate cake, treacle tarts and strawberries and cream. They will dine on large tables in the Marble Hall which has been decorated in bunting made from fabrics recycled from the Royal estate. Here are some images from the flypast for the 80th anniversary of VE Day: Members of the royal family watched from Buckingham Palace's balcony as the VE Day flypast soared over. King Charles and Queen Camilla as well as the Prince and Princess of Wales and their children were on the balcony. The first aircraft, a Lancaster Bomber, reached the palace at 1.45pm BST with more planes following behind. Veterans watching in Buckingham Palace smiled and looked up as the flypast went over, reports the PA news agency. Army veteran Joe Mines, 100, waved as the planes went over, while others applauded. Politicians including prime minister Keir Starmer, London mayor Sadiq Khan, foreign secretary David Lammy and Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch joined veterans and actor Timothy Spall on the Buckingham Palace garden steps to watch the flyover. They were serenaded by a brass band as they waited for the aircraft. Some of the group applauded, waved and pointed as the first planes flew over the palace. Crowds have gathered in front of the gates of Buckingham Palace as the RAF flypast begins. Earlier, a line of police officers walked hundreds of spectators forward along the Mall past the Queen Victoria Memorial. Many people in the crowd are waving flags, while children are being carried on shoulders to ensure they can catch a glimpse of Buckingham Palace, reports the PA news agency. Amid windy conditions and grey skies, there is a jovial atmosphere with members of the public taking photos and videos as they move towards the palace. Crowds cheered loudly as the military displayed the Ukraine flag as they marched towards Buckingham Palace, reports the PA news agency. Military bands played medleys of second world war-era music as they marched. Here are some more images via the newswires as crowds move towards Buckingham Palace to watch the RAF flypast and see the royal family on the balcony: Members of the royal family are expected to make an appearance on the Buckingham Palace balcony to watch the Royal Air Force (RAF) flypast. The Red Arrows flypast is scheduled fo r1.45pm BST. It is understood there are no plans for any changes to the flypast despite the weather, reports the PA news agency. If you're joining the live blog now, here is a summary of the day's events so far: Senior royals have joined thousands of people in the London rain to observe a military procession to begin commemorations marking the end of the second world war in Europe. King Charles and Queen Camilla were joined in the royal box by the Prince and Princess of Wales and their children Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis to watch the procession.

The military procession has now finished and the national anthem will be played shortly. Members of the royal family will then watch a flypast from the palace balcony where, 80 years ago, George VI, Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother and the princesses Elizabeth and Margaret made multiple appearances before a cheering crowd. Later, King Charles and Queen Camilla will host a tea party reception for about 50 veterans and members of the second world war generation at Buckingham Palace. In Whitehall, the Cenotaph has been draped in a large union flag, with the south and north face of the landmark covered.

Thirty further veterans are to attend official events on Monday, including 26 who will watch the procession in London, reports the PA news agency. The list includes Royal Navy veteran Albert Keir, 99; Royal Engineers veteran Alfred Littlefield, 101; Royal Air Force (RAF) veteran Bernard Morgan, 101; army veterans Arthur Oborne, 99, and Tom Stonehouse, 99; and Royal Marines veteran Francis James Grant, 99; who all served during D-day. The Nato detachment, which included personnel from Poland, Lithuania and Sweden, marched in the procession wearing the uniforms of their nations under the Nato flag. Representatives of the Ukrainian military, selected from the UK armed forces' training programme for Ukrainian recruits, also took part. The BBC's royal correspondent, Sean Coughlan, who is reporting from the Mall says that there was appaluse from the royal viewing platform as the Ukrainian contingent walked past in the military procession, carrying the blue and yellow flag of their country. Massed Pipes and Drums, kitted out in kilts, played Scotland The Brave as they marched down Whitehall, to cheers and claps from some of the crowd. As the final groups in the procession passed the Cenotaph, many spectators began to follow them towards the Mall to see them make their way towards Buckingham Palace, according to the PA news agency. King Charles stood and saluted as the start of the procession reached the Queen Victoria Memorial. Before the procession arrived, cadets and scouts watching on cheered and waved to the royal family from the paths nearby, reports the PA news agency. Here are some images of the VE Day 80th anniversary military procession coming in via the newswires: The military procession is under way. As mentioned previously, you can watch live coverage of it via the stream at the top of this blog. Also, for ease, here is the map of the parade route which was posted in the blog earlier: Crowds on Whitehall cheered and clapped as Ukraine's marching detachment passed the Cenotaph. Some spectators stood on walls and street furniture to get a better view of the procession, reports the PA news agency. There was a sea of colour down Whitehall as the Band of the Irish guards, wearing red, marched down Whitehall, closely followed by the flags of the Commonwealth nations. The Prince and Princess of Wales's children have joined King Charles, Queen Camilla and veterans to watch a military parade marking the 80th anniversary of the end of the second world war in Europe. The procession of 1,300 members of the armed forces and Nato allies, past some of London's most famous buildings and monuments and ending at Buckingham Palace, commemorates the service of those who fought to bring peace to Europe and the rest of the world. Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis made a rare public appearance with their parents William and Kate to see the ceremony which began a few minutes before they arrived at the royal box. Charles and Camilla led the royal party sat in the shadow of the Queen Victoria Memorial who included the Princess Royal and her husband, Vice Adm Tim Laurence, the Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh and the Duke of Kent. Nearby were sat second world war veterans and prime minister Keir Starmer. Crowds have lined the Mall, with some waiting since early morning to secure a good spot to watch events. Normandy veteran Alan Kennett, 100, who was in the Royal Air Force (RAF) with the Mustang Squadron and was in Celle near Belsen on VE Day, formally started the VE Day procession in central London on Monday. Garrison Sergeant Major Warrant Officer Class One Andrew Stokes, of the Coldstream guards, asked Kennett, who sat on a chair in Parliament Square flanked by cadets, for permission to march. He said: Thank you and your generation for securing our freedom 80 years ago. May I have your permission to start the parade please? \"Carry on,\" Kennett replied. Kennett had earlier been presented with the Commonwealth War Graves Commission's Torch of Peace by one of the cadets. Actor Timothy Spall has kicked off commemorative events for the 80th anniversary of VE Day in London as he delivered some of the words of Winston Churchill's 1945 victory speech. Speaking in Parliament Square in front of a statue honouring Winston after Big Ben struck midday, Spall said: My dear friends, this is your hour. This is not victory of a party or of any class. It's a victory of the Great British nation as a whole. We were the first, in this ancient island, to draw the sword against tyranny. Wearing a dark grey suit, Spall continued: Every man, woman and child in the country had no thought of quitting the struggle. When shall the reputation and faith of this generation of men and women fail? I say that in the long years to come not only will the people of this island, but of the world, wherever the bird of freedom chirps in human hearts, look back to what we have done and they will say: 'Do not despair, do not yield to violence and tyranny, march straightforward and die if need be unconquered'. You can follow the television coverage of the VE Day 80th anniversary ceremony via the live stream at the top of this blog. You may have to refresh the page to see it. The actor Timothy Spall, who portrayed Winston Churchill in the film The King's Speech, has begun the VE Day 80th anniversary commerations by reading extracts from the wartime prime minister's VE Day broadcast. Normandy veteran Alan Kennett, 100, will formally start the procession after being handed the Commonwealth War Graves Torch for Peace. Members of the royal family and government officials have been arriving for the VE Day 80th annivesary ceremony. Live television coverage showed the UK prime minister, Keir Starmer, taking his seat shortly before Big Ben chimed at 12pm. Foreign secretary, David Lammy, has also been pictured arriving. Reporters from the PA news agency have been speaking to members of the public who have turned out to watch today's military procession: \"I just love the celebration of it all,\" said Laura Bill, a 1940s re-enactor from Staffordshire. The Bill family, who all dressed in 1940s-style clothing for the parade, travelled for three hours to Buckingham Palace. She said: We've done reenactments all over the country. We shop at vintage shops a lot. There are traders at events who we buy clothes from. Today is about coming together, and I'm so excited for it. Jacqueline Bill, Laura's mother, said: It's great to do this as a family. It's more of a social thing. We know a woman who collects 1940s wedding dresses, we're hoping to meet up with her later. Lesley Watson and her friend David are in Whitehall to witness the parade. David, who did not wish to be fully named, said: We are here to show the veterans who are on the parade that we support them and we will carry on the tradition. David, who worked in the Royal Navy for 12 years, wore medals he received for his time working in what was then called Yugoslavia from 1993 to 1995. Watson, whose father joined the East Surrey Tower Corps during the second world war when he was 17, stressed the importance of remembering veterans. \"My father is not alive now but he would have been 97,\" she said. Two women gathered outside Buckingham Palace made their own dresses for the occasion. Grace Gothard, from Ghana, describing her union flag dress, said: I made this dress personally. So anytime there's any Royal occasion I make my own dresses. It took two weeks to make. The last one was the king's coronation and that dress is in a museum now. Satvinder Cubb, wearing a dress which reads 'Lest We Forget', added: I also made my dress. I had a union flag one before but this year I wanted something simple to represent all the soldiers that actually fought. It took just a few hours to make because it's actually two flags joined together. And I don't have a sewing machine so it was all by hand. The pair met at the queen's jubilee and have attended Royal events together in handmade dresses ever since, reports the PA news agency. They arrived at the Mall at 6am this morning. Cubb added: I know people who have actually fought in the war. I have a very close friend, he's 94 and was 14 at the time. It's just about thanking them all. We're here for a reason and have freedom now. It's important for us to be a part of it. With the military procession to begin soon, those taking part in the parade have been getting into position. About 1300 members of the armed forces, including the Royal Navy, the Royal Marines, the British army and the Royal Air Force, along with Commonwealth nations, Ukraine, and Nato allies are taking part in the military procession for VE Day. If you or your friends and family have memories of the end of the second world war in Europe, the Guardian community team would like to hear from you. Do you have stories or photographs of the celebrations? Were you or a family member a child at the time, or still in active service on VE Day, and if so where?

Please share your story if you are 18 or over, anonymously if you wish. For more information please see our terms of service and privacy policy. Ahead of today's military procession, Lisa Nandy, the culture secretary, said: 80 years ago millions of people celebrated the end of the second world war in Europe. This week, we will recreate this moment across towns and cities, in our homes, in pubs and on our streets. We must do all we can to ensure that the stories and memories of this period in our history are not forgotten. We must not forget the hardships, the heroics and the millions who lost their lives. We are here because of the sacrifices they made and the horrors they endured. This week, I urge the nation to come together and send a powerful message: we will remember them. Actor Timothy Spall has been pictured this morning rehearsing Winston Churchill's 1945 victory speech, in front of the statue of the war time leader. Spall will do this reading at 12pm before the military procession begins. Here are some images coming in via the newswires today: At 12pm BST, actor Timothy Spall will read part of Winston Churchill's VE Day broadcast. A military procession will then begin, making its way from Parliament Square towards Whitehall, passing by the Cenotaph, before heading to Buckingham Palace via the Mall near Trafalgar Square. You can see the full procession route in the map below: At 1.45pm, King Charles and Queen Camilla will watch a flypast of current and historic military aircraft over Buckingham Palace. People are beginning to gather near the Cenotaph ahead of the procession at noon. Maria Crook, 69, travelled from Devon to London on Sunday and set up to watch the procession from Whitehall early this morning. \"I think it's extremely important to pay our respects and honour those who have died for us,\" she told the PA news agency. The 69-year-old, wearing a hat with red, white and blue ribbons tied to it, sat near the Cenotaph and attached a large union flag with silhouettes of paratroopers on it to the barriers in front of her. Crook said: I came for VE Day in 2005 and the atmosphere was fantastic. I'm going to dash down to Buckingham Palace after I've seen the procession. I want to get a great view of the Red Arrows and hopefully see Charles too. As we await the start of today's ceremony in London, the PA news agency has been speaking to those that have travelled to the city to watch the parade: One group of women gathered outside Buckingham Palace have brought along song sheets to pass out to the crowd. They practised singing their songs ahead of the parade. Mandy Ellis, 67, from the Midlands, said: We do all the royal events. I've been doing this 60 years now. We all get the gang together - there's seven of us come down. The oldest is my auntie Linda, she's 87. My daughter Cara, she's the youngest. Wearing a union flag hat, she said: I sing in the local choir, we've had some song sheets over the years for different events so I just adapted them at home. We've got everything from Land of Hope and Glory, We'll Meet Again, Pack Up Your Troubles, the national anthem. It's the smallest thing we can do to say thank you for 80 years of peace and the sacrifice everyone made. David Smith, a military royal engineer from 1960 to 1972, travelled from Lincolnshire on Sunday to honour the veterans at the parade. The 79-year-old said: \"It's about patriotism. It's what we do.\" Smith has marched at the Cenotaph for 26 years and will watch the parade on Monday from the Mall. His wife, Muriel, said: Where we live in Lincolnshire, the 'bomber county', there is always a bomber base five miles from you. There's still air raid shelters where we live. About the parade, the 77-year-old said: I just love the songs, the ceremony, everything. I've heard some stories about Victory Day. Some naughty stories! Lizzie McCrae MacIntyre, a retired Women's Royal Air Force veteran, arrived at the Admiralty Arch, Westminster at 4am to see the parade. MacIntyre, who travelled from Surrey, said: It's so important to remember those that didn't make it home. My dad was military, my brother was air force. Geoffrey York, 71, said: \"We are all ex-military.\" The Household Cavalry veteran said: We were here for the coronation, we camped out for three nights for the queen's funeral. It's a big day for us to pay our respects. My dad was a prisoner of war in Tobruk, Libya. He escaped in 1944. Street parties will be held in towns and cities across the UK as part of the special events - including community tea parties, 1940s dress-up events, and gatherings on second world war warships, reports the PA news agency. Local authorities throughout the country have offered support for communities and organisations wishing to hold a VE Day street party, with some councils such as Portsmouth waiving fees to close roads for the celebrations. The Palace of Westminster, the Shard, Lowther Castle in Penrith, Manchester Printworks, Cardiff Castle and Belfast City Hall are among hundreds of buildings which will be lit up from 9pm on Tuesday. A new display of almost 30,000 ceramic poppies at the Tower of London is also set to form another touching tribute. The poppies have been aranged to resemble a wound to reflect the long-lasting sacrifices made during the war. A service at Westminster Abbey will begin with a national two-minute silence of reflection and remembrance on Thursday, where veterans will be part of the congregation. Horse Guards Parade will then hold a live celebratory concert to round off the commemorations. Pubs and bars have also been granted permission to stay open for longer to mark the anniversary. Venues in England and Wales which usually close at 11pm will be able to keep serving for an extra two hours to celebrate on Thursday. Churches and cathedrals across the country will ring their bells as a collective act of thanksgiving at 6.30pm, echoing the sounds that swept across the country in 1945, the Church of England said. Photos from VE Day in 1945 showed joyous scenes across London as crowds gathered to celebrate victory over Nazi Germany. Ten years ago, the Imperial War Museum released colourised, amateur footage shot in London on Victory in Europe Day that showed how people in their thousands turned out to celebrate in the capital. The actor Sheila Hancock, who was evacuated from her London home during the second world war, wrote for the Guardian on her memories of VE Day, reminding readers that it was a muted celebration marked as much by tragedy as triumph. In an extract, she writes: This month, we are commemorating the 80th anniversary of VE Day, and I worry that we will turn it into a yet another jingoistic celebration of the second world war. Yes, in 1945 we were relieved that the bombs and doodlebugs and rocket weapons had stopped, and we heard there was fun going on in the West End of London - but where I lived it was less jubilant. The war there felt far from over: we were still waiting anxiously for the return of the young lad next door from the rumoured horror of a Japanese prisoner of war camp, and many of my friends were trying to accept as fathers strange men they barely knew. The unspeakable details of the Holocaust were being revealed, and I imagine the grownups were utterly exhausted and often grief-stricken. For five years, they had lived under the threat of occupation. Churchill said we would fight them on the beaches and never surrender, but he did not deny that we could be invaded. In fact, it was a miracle we were not. And that threat is what the grownups lived with, and presumably, being unequipped, knew they could not withstand. More than 30 veterans of the second world war are to attend celebrations in London to mark the 80th anniversary of VE Day. The Royal British Legion has worked with their families and the government to ensure as many as possible can be there to see 1,300 members of the armed forces take part in a procession through London, PA Media reports. The charity will also host a VE Day tea party and service of remembrance at the National Memorial Arboretum in Staffordshire on 8 May, the anniversary of VE Day, where they expect to see more than 40 Second World War veterans. A total of 31 veterans are to attend official events on Monday, including 26 who will watch the parade, which will head from Parliament Square to Whitehall, then to Trafalgar Square, Admiralty Arch, The Mall, and finally to Buckingham Palace. RAF veteran Alan Kennett, who will turn 101 on May 29, will formally start the parade as he receives the Commonwealth War Graves' Torch For Peace from air cadet warrant officer Emmy Jones. Mr Kennett was in a cinema in Celle, north-central Germany, when the doors burst open as a soldier drove a jeep into the venue and shouted: \"The war is over.\" He said the cinema erupted with joy, and celebrations soon spread through the streets. The British public is largely unaware of the contribution made by soldiers from Commonwealth countries such as Jamaica and Kenya to the second world war, research has found, as campaigners say greater recognition of the diversity of those who fought against fascism will strengthen national unity. Community affairs correspondent Chris Osuh writes: Before the 80th anniversary of VE Day on 8 May, a FocalData poll for the thinktank British Future, which works to highlight integration, found \"a strong public appetite\" for greater awareness and teaching in schools of the diversity of the war effort - but a lack of knowledge about the contribution of Black and Asian personnel. The research found 86% of respondents agreed \"all those who fought for Britain in the world wars, regardless of where they came from\" should be commemorated and 77% felt remembering the \"shared wartime history\" of British and Commonwealth troops could help build cohesion in today's \"multi-ethnic society\". But only 24% of respondents were aware troops from Jamaica and Kenya fought for Britain, while only 34% were aware of Muslim soldiers' contributions and only 43% knew about the service of Sikh personnel. The findings of the poll, from a representative sample of 1,079 adults, come as the Commonwealth War Graves Commission (CWGC) urges people to reflect on the \"loss of so many from across the globe\" this VE Day, which marks the official surrender of Nazi Germany. Read the full story here. Garrison Sergeant Major Vern Stokes, who is in charge of the VE Day military procession, said the participation of Ukrainian and Nato troops is a reminder that \"allies really do matter\". He told BBC Breakfast that it is \"right\" for Ukrainian and Nato troops to take part in the procession in central London, where from midday 1,300 people will march along The Mall. He said: \"Eighty years ago we were stronger together and today we are stronger together, and it's just a reminder for us that allies really do matter and it's nice for them to be able to take part.\" Calling veterans the \"VVIPs\", he added: \"Today is very much their day and we're very proud to be able to honour them.\" Eighty years after Winston Churchill addressed the nation from Downing Street with the words \"This is your victory!\" a recitation of his famous VE Day speech will be broadcast as the nation commemorates the day the Allies formally accepted Germany's surrender in 1945. The actor Timothy Spall, who portrayed Churchill in the film The King's Speech, will read extracts from the wartime prime minister's VE Day broadcast on Monday, as the Normandy veteran Alan Kennett, 100, formally starts the procession. In Whitehall the Cenotaph has been draped in a large Union flag, with the south and north face of the landmark covered. It is the first time the war memorial has been draped in Union flags since it was unveiled by King George V more than a century ago, in 1920. Crowds have started to gather on The Mall, with some arriving on Sunday evening to secure a good viewing spot. Alan Kennett, a 100-year-old Normandy veteran, will start the procession in London which is set to march down Whitehall, through Admiralty Arch and up The Mall towards Buckingham Palace. The King, Queen, Keir Starmer and second world war veterans will be on a platform on the Queen Victoria Memorial in front of Buckingham Palace. Members of the royal family are later expected to make an appearance on the Buckingham Palace balcony to watch the RAF flypast. On VE Day 1945, the then Princess Elizabeth, dressed in her Auxiliary Territorial Service uniform, slipped out of the palace and joined the cheering crowds outside incognito. She once described it as \"one of the most memorable nights of my life\". Following her death in 2022, this year will be the first landmark VE Day commemoration without any of the royals who stood on the balcony that day. A Nato detachment, which will also include personnel from Poland, Lithuania and Sweden, will march in the procession wearing the uniforms of their respective nations under the Nato flag. Representatives of the Ukrainian military, selected from the UK armed forces' training programme for Ukrainian recruits Operation Interflex, will also take part. Victory in Europe Day (VE Day) on 8 May 1945 was the day the allies accepted Nazi Germany's surrender in the war in Europe. The war in the East did not end until 15 August 1945, when Japan surrendered on a day celebrated as Victory over Japan Day (VJ Day). At 3pm BST Winston Churchill spoke to the nation and announced that Germany had signed an unconditional surrender of all German land, sea and air forces in Europe to the Allied Expeditionary Forces and Soviet High Command. \"Hostilities will end officially at one minute after midnight tonight,\" he said. Later he made another speech, to cheering crowds, after he had made his way down Whitehall and on to the balcony of the ministry of health. Crowds had massed in Trafalgar Square and along the Mall to Buckingham Palace. My dear friends, this is your hour. This is not victory of a party or of any class. It's a victory of the great British nation as a whole. We were the first, in this ancient island, to draw the sword against tyranny. After a while we were left all alone against the most tremendous military power that has been seen. We were all alone for a whole year. \"There we stood, alone. Did anyone want to give in? Were we down-hearted? \"The lights went out and the bombs came down. But every man, woman and child in the country had no thought of quitting the struggle. London can take it. \"So we came back after long months from the jaws of death, out of the mouth of hell, while all the world wondered. When shall the reputation and faith of this generation of English men and women fail? \"I say that in the long years to come not only will the people of this island but of the world, wherever the bird of freedom chirps in human hearts, look back to what we've done and they will say: 'Do not despair, do not yield to violence and tyranny, march straightforward and die if need be-unconquered.' \"Now we have emerged from one deadly struggle - a terrible foe has been cast on the ground and awaits our judgment and our mercy. \"But there is another foe who occupies large portions of the British Empire, a foe stained with cruelty and greed - the Japanese. I rejoice we can all take a night off today and another day tomorrow. \"Tomorrow our great Russian allies will also be celebrating victory and after that we must begin the task of rebuilding our hearth and homes, doing our utmost to make this country a land in which all have a chance, in which all have a duty, and we must turn ourselves to fulfill our duty to our own countrymen, and to our gallant allies of the United States who were so foully and treacherously attacked by Japan. \"We will go hand and hand with them. \"Even if it is a hard struggle we will not be the ones who will fail.\" Keir Starmer has praised the \"selfless dedication\" of those who have served in the military before the anniversary of VE Day as the government unveiled a new PS50m support system for veterans. In an open letter to mark 80 years since the end of the second world war in Europe, the prime minister said the sacrifice made by members of the armed forces was a debt that could \"never fully be repaid\". He said the country would show how thankful it was during events to commemorate VE Day, which signalled the end of fighting on 8 May 1945. \"It was also a victory for good against the assembled forces of hatred, tyranny and evil,\" Starmer wrote. \"VE Day is a chance to acknowledge, again, that our debt to those who achieved it can never fully be repaid.\" Starmer said his thoughts would turn both to those who served in the second world war and those who carried \"the torch of their legacy\" today. \"Alongside our history and our values, service is the other great force that binds a nation together,\" he said. \"So this week, I want you to know: the whole nation is inspired by the selfless dedication of your example.\" Midday BST: The ceremony begins in Parliament Square when Big Ben strikes midday, and an actor will recite extracts from the iconic Winston Churchill VE Day speech. A young person will then pass the Commonwealth War Graves Torch for Peace to Alan Kennett, 100, a Second World War veteran who served in the Normandy campaign. The Torch for Peace is an enduring symbol, honouring the contributions made by individuals, which will act as a baton to pass and share stories to future generations. At 12.10 BST The procession will make its way to Buckingham Palace. The Household Cavalry Mounted Regiment and The King's Troop, Royal Horse Artillery will then lead the procession from Parliament Square, down Whitehall and past the Cenotaph which will be dressed in Union Flags, through Admiralty Arch and up The Mall through to Buckingham Palace where the procession will finish. They will be followed by a tri-service procession group featuring marching members of the Royal Navy, the Royal Marines, the British Army and the Royal Air Force. Cadets from all three services and other uniformed youth groups will also take part in the procession to ensure the message of VE Day is handed down to a new generation. The Prime Minister and Second World War veterans supported by the Royal British Legion will watch the procession from a specially built dais on the Queen Victoria Memorial. The King and Queen will be joined by the Prince and Princess of Wales to watch the procession At 1.45pm BST a flypast featuring the Red Arrows and current and historic aircraft will take place The King and Queen will host a tea party at Buckingham Palace for veterans, families and members of the wartime generation. VE Day 80 street parties, picnics and community events will take place around the country. Welcome to live coverage of the UK commemorations of VE Day. On 8 May 1945, Winston Churchill announced that the war in Europe was over and crowd took to the streets to celebrate. Commemorative evens will be held across the UK and further afield over the next week to mark the anniversary with a procession down Whitehall and a flypast from the Red Arrows over central London later today. There will be a service in Westminster Abbey on Thursday and, in August, another commemoration of Victory over Japan Day (VJ Day).",

      "summary": "Royal family and war veterans watch 1,300-strong military procession in London while street parties held around UK",
      "content": "As Big Ben chimed at noon and with the Cenotaph, the symbol of sacrifice, draped in the union flag for the first time since its unveiling in 1920, the UK marked the 80th anniversary of VE Day with military pomp before large crowds who had gathered in central London. Buckingham Palace may have served as the centrepiece of Monday's spectacle before Thursday's anniversary of Victory in Europe Day. At the event's heart, however, were the VVIP second world war veterans, those remaining few who bore actual witness then and who today serve to remind. Back in 1945, Britain allowed itself a brief period of rejoicing on VE Day, with overwhelming relief and optimism at Germany's surrender after long wartime years of deprivation and huge loss of life on all sides. On Monday, the first of four days of commemorations, tribute was paid with a 1,300-strong military procession, a flypast, marching bands, massed pipes and drums, and youth cadets. The procession set off from beneath the bronze gaze of Churchill's statue in Parliament Square and ended outside the palace. Elsewhere, street parties were held across the UK. Thousands crowded on to the Mall, many waving red, white and blue flags. Watching from a dais on the Queen Victoria Memorial were the king, queen, senior royals and the prime minister, Keir Starmer, sitting alongside those who had served in the war and who were wrapped up both in their memories and against the spring chill. As Big Ben fell silent, the actor Timothy Spall boomed aloud words from Churchill's victory speech beginning: \"My dear friends, this is your hour.\" Alan Kennett, a 100-year-old Normandy veteran, then started the parade as he was handed the Commonwealth War Graves torch for peace. In 1945, Kennett, from Lichfield, was in Celle, near Belsen, in a cinema with other men in his unit, when they were told the war had ended. \"The whole place erupted and of course it became one great party,\" he recalled. UK armed forces personnel were joined by representatives from Commonwealth and Nato allies. A detachment of Ukrainian military, selected from the UK armed forces' training programme for Ukrainian recruits, offered a reminder that while VE Day marked peace, war continued today in many corners of the world. A Buckingham Palace tea party for 30 second world war veterans aged from 98 to 104, and about 20 evacuees and others who lived through the war, was hosted by the king and queen. Those invited included a 98-year-old former prisoner of war, a 99-year-old who served in the Desert Rats and took part in the D-day landings, and a 100-year-old woman who worked in the Special Operations Executive (SOE), known as Churchill's secret army. Prince George attended with his parents. His father, the Prince of Wales, spoke to Alfred Littlefield, a 101-year-old Royal Engineers D-day veteran, of the importance of preserving veterans' stories. William smiled as he shook hands with veterans and said it was very important for George and the next generation to hear stories from those who fought in the war. Starmer hosted a tea party in Downing Street, with guests served a menu including Victoria sponge cake, scotch eggs and pork pies. A flypast of 23 historical and current aircraft, including a Lancaster Bomber and the famous Red Arrows streaming red, white and blue, flew over the crowd in the Mall and the royals watching from the palace balcony to conclude Monday's official commemorations. Another of those invited to the palace tea party was Joyce Wilding, 100, who enlisted at 18 into the First Aid Nursing Yeomanry and worked in the SOE. Recalling VE Day, she said: \"We went to Piccadilly where there was a stream of people singing and dancing. We joined a crocodile and did the palais glide down Piccadilly. There were soldiers up lamp-posts, it was extraordinary.\" Bernard Morgan, a 101-year-old RAF D-day veteran who worked as a codebreaker, received a secret telegraph message two days before VE Day that read: \"German war now over, surrender effective sometime tomorrow.\" When it was officially confirmed on 8 May, he and his comrades lit a huge bonfire and celebrated until late into the night. He said: \"It's so important that we make the most of these opportunities to remember what happened, not just to celebrate the achievement but also to ensure that such horrors never happen again.\" * A picture caption on this article was amended on 5 May 2025.

      "published": "2025-05-05",
      "summary": "Catholic charity says the late pontiff endorsed the idea of creating a ‘vehicle of hope’ to deliver medical aid",
      "content": "Just over a decade ago, the converted Mitsubishi whisked Pope Francis through the streets of Bethlehem before it was left to gather dust. Now, in keeping with one of the late pontiff's last wishes, the popemobile is being given a second life - as a mobile health clinic for children in the Gaza Strip. In a region ravaged by more than 18 months of war, the initiative is both symbolic and practical, said Peter Brune, the secretary general of the Catholic charity Caritas Sweden. \"We call it a vehicle of hope because it conveys a message to the children of Gaza that peace is possible, there will be peace, you will have a future and the world has not forgotten about you. And then there's the very practical dimension in that it will actually deliver medical aid to affected children.\" Brune and his counterpart at Caritas Jerusalem, Anton Asfar, came up with the idea late last year. They soon arranged to have the question put to Pope Francis. \"We got a letter from the pope saying, 'Yes I'm glad to say that I fully endorse this idea',\" said Brune. Work swiftly began on fitting out the vehicle, which had been left sitting in Bethlehem since the 2014 visit, with supplies such as rapid tests for infections, suture kits and oxygen as well as a refrigerator for medication. It will be used to diagnose and treat children who have no access to healthcare, bolstering the aid provided by Caritas Jerusalem, which has about 100 staff on the ground in Gaza. \"This is a concrete, life-saving intervention at a time when the health system in Gaza has almost completely collapsed,\" said Brune. The announcement, made days before the start of the conclave to elect a new pope, echoes Francis's deep commitment to those caught in the crossfire of the conflict. He had long called for an end to the hostilities and voiced his disapproval at how the war was being carried out. \"Yesterday children were bombed. This is cruelty, this is not war,\" he said in December after an Israeli airstrike killed seven children from one family. He added: \"I want to say it because it touches my heart.\" For much of the past year and a half, Francis had made nightly calls to Gaza's only Catholic church, offering his unwavering support to the congregation as they grappled with the pain and devastation of war. \"It was close to his heart,\" said Brune. \"Since the war broke out, 3% of the Christians in Gaza have been killed.\" The transformed popemobile is expected to be ready in a week or so, said Brune, and talks have been launched in the hope of obtaining permission from Israeli officials to bring it into Gaza. Brune described the situation on the ground as urgent. \"Since 2 March, no aid has been let into Gaza at all. It's horrible. A few months ago, when it was cold, children were freezing to death. Now they're starving to death.\" While aid groups have warned that Israel's blockade of food and medicine into Gaza has left civilians in the territory facing starvation, Israel has said that the blockade, along with its renewed military campaign, is aimed at pressuring Hamas to release the remaining hostages. Unicef said last month that the conflict had killed more than 15,000 children, injured tens of thousands of others and left nearly 1 million children repeatedly displaced in the Gaza Strip, adding to warnings that the humanitarian situation had reached its worst point since the hostilities broke out in 2023. The war in Gaza was triggered by a surprise attack launched by Hamas into Israel on 7 October, in which militants killed more than 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took 250 hostages. Israeli officials say 59 hostages remain in Gaza, more than half of whom are believed to be dead. Brune called for aid to be let in. \"It's forbidden to use civilians and, even worse, children as some kind of instrument in an ongoing war between adults,\" he said. \"It's against all humanitarian principles and laws.\" He hoped the popemobile's transformation would set a precedent of sorts, paving the way for other papal vehicles to be repurposed. \"Maybe Gaza now, but then Ukraine in the future or Congo or other places,\" he said. \"Everywhere where humanitarian access is denied, we want to apply the principle of saying that the popemobile will stand for the importance of letting humanitarian aid come through.\"",
      "ml_hf_summary": "A former popemobile used by Pope Francis during his 2014 visit to Bethlehem is being repurposed into a mobile health clinic for children in the Gaza Strip. The initiative, endorsed by Pope Francis before his death, aims to provide medical aid to children lacking access to healthcare in the war-torn region. Caritas Sweden and Caritas Jerusalem collaborated on the project, outfitting the vehicle with medical supplies such as rapid test kits, suture kits, oxygen, and a refrigerator for medication.  The transformed popemobile is expected to be operational within a week, pending permission from Israeli officials to enter Gaza. The project highlights the urgent humanitarian needs in Gaza, where a blockade has restricted the entry of aid since March 2nd, exacerbating the suffering of civilians, particularly children.\n\n\n"

      "summary": "Signalling cable taken from four locations, delaying high-speed services between Madrid and Seville, week after massive power cut",
      "content": "Spain's transport minister has said the country's rail network suffered \"an act of serious sabotage\" after vital signalling cable was stolen over the busy bank holiday weekend, bringing severe delays to high-speed services between Madrid and Seville that affected more than 10,000 travellers. Government sources said the problems on the line between the capital and the southern region of Andalucia had been caused by the theft of copper cable from five different locations in the Toledo area, south of Madrid, late on Sunday. They said that while the cables that had been targeted had little monetary value - being worth a total of around EUR300 (PS256) - they were essential to the safety of the lines as they allow the system to know where trains are. \"If those safety cables are taken, then the line is blind,\" they added. \"They're optimal if you want to put the whole line out of service.\" As the country's state-owned rail operator, Renfe, and the railway infrastructure company, Adif, rushed to restore services, Spain's transport minister, Oscar Puente, said: \"We have suffered an act of serious sabotage on the high-speed line between Madrid and Seville\". He urged anyone with information to contact the police. In a radio interview on Monday morning, Puente said the network appeared to have been deliberately targeted. \"This is a low-value theft,\" he told Cadena Ser. \"Whoever did it knew what they were doing because there were no cameras and the financial gain is absolutely negligible compared with the enormous damage.\" The minister said he viewed the incident as \"damage\" rather than theft, adding that it involved 150 metres of cable. Alvaro Fernandez Heredia, the president of Renfe, said he also felt the theft was suspicious. \"It's strange and I'm sure the transport ministry and the police will be looking into this because it isn't something we've seen up until now,\" he toldRadio Nacional de Espana. Asked if he shared Puente's contention that it was a case of sabotage: \"I do ... The theft of signalling cable on which the safety infrastructure depends is sabotage, even if it's just simple theft because it's an attack on the infrastructure itself.\" The interior ministry said the Guardia Civil had opened an investigation, adding that both that force and the Policia Nacional had long been in contact with Adif as part of a special plan for prevent the theft of copper from the rail network. According to interior ministry statistics, there were 4,433 thefts involving copper and conductive materials last year. By 9.30am on Monday, Renfe and Adif said the Madrid to Seville line was running again and hoped services would return to normal over the course of the day. By early Monday morning, Alberto Valero and his family, visiting Spain from Mexico, had spent hours at Madrid's Atocha station, waiting for a train to Seville. \"We're here with tourists from everywhere; France, Portugal,\" Valero told the Associated Press. \"Everyone is at a loss for what to do because of the total disarray.\" The severe delays came a week after Spain and neighbouring Portugal suffered an unprecedented and as yet unexplained power blackout, prompting the opposition conservative People's party (PP) to accuse the socialist-led government of incompetence. \"We've had two events in the past week that are more commonly seen in countries we wouldn't want to resemble; countries where the government has forgotten about its citizens,\" said PP sources. The PP's leader, Alberto Nunez Feijoo, said thousands of people had been stranded on trains overnight without water. \"This is the second Monday when we've had scenes that do not befit the fourth-largest eurozone economy,\" he said. \"People don't deserve to be paying more taxes for worse services. Spain needs to function again and that's my aim.\" In an interview with El Pais on Sunday, Spain's environment minister, Sara Aagesen, warned it could take days to discover the reasons for last week's power outage. She also echoed her view that it was far too soon for opposition parties and others to be pointing the finger at the country's renewable energy sources as a possible cause. \"Blaming renewable as a [reason for the blackout] seems irresponsible and simplistic to me,\" said Aagesen. \"Irresponsible because we're talking about a resource that has been part of our energetic mix for a long time. And, besides, we've had very similar power generation on many previous days, with lots of renewables and even with lower demand - and the system has worked perfectly.\"",

      "summary": "British Virgin Islands criticised for launching financial crime-fighting cartoon mascot before new legislation",
      "content": "UK offshore havens have missed a deadline to publish their plans to improve corporate transparency, as MPs criticised the British Virgin Islands (BVI) in particular for launching a financial crime-fighting cartoon mascot before new legislation. Jurisdictions including the BVI and Bermuda pledged last year to approve laws allowing access to company ownership data to those with a \"legitimate interest\" by April 2025, with implementation to follow in June. But four British overseas territories - the BVI, Bermuda, Anguilla and Turks & Caicos - have failed to meet the deadline, the Guardian understands. Any further delay is likely to fuel lingering concerns that UK offshore centres famed for their secrecy are dragging their feet on the UK's transparency push, risking a clash between Westminster and the islands' governments. The BVI, named in multiple international investigations into alleged financial wrongdoing, has yet to introduce legislation to make its registers of beneficial ownership available to those with a legitimate interest in seeing the information. In the meantime, the islands' government has launched a cartoon bird, called Riley Right, whose stated mission is to encourage \"responsibility, integrity, global awareness, honesty, and transparency\". The bird, which appears to be a green parakeet wearing a suit, is part of a larger action plan published by the BVI's National Anti-Money Laundering and Countering the Financing of Terrorism Coordinating Council. Joe Powell MP, who leads a UK cross-parliamentary group (APPG) examining financial crime and tax, said: \"The British Virgin Islands have not only missed a key deadline they committed to at the joint ministerial council, but are now making a mockery of UK values by unveiling a cartoon mascot instead of taking real action against economic crime. \"If the BVI wishes to do business under the British flag and our rule of law, they must also uphold the standards of transparency and integrity we expect. This trivialisation of serious global financial threats undermines our fight against money laundering and kleptocracy - and it ultimately makes Britain less safe. \"It is deeply disappointing that the BVI and other overseas territories continue to delay the implementation of vital transparency measures. The UK must now look seriously at how to ensure these longstanding commitments are delivered.\" Granting access to ownership data to those with a \"legitimate interest\" is seen as a stepping stone to full publicly accessible registers of beneficial ownership , a measure that ministers and campaign groups believe should become the global norm in an international crackdown on financial crime. Phil Brickell, who is a member of the same APPG that Powell chairs, said: \"While I welcome efforts to promote doing business the right way anywhere, surely time and money would be better spent lifting the veil of corporate secrecy in the British Virgin Islands which has been used by the world's crooks and kleptocrats to clean and stash their dirty cash.\" A spokesperson for the BVI said Riley Right was a \"simple and effective way to engage the wider community and enhance understanding\". \"Dismissing or looking at it in isolation would present a highly misleading depiction of the scale of work we have undertaken. It does not negate or replace our broader international commitments in any way.\" Regarding open ownership registers, they added that the BVI government was \"in the late stages of finalising its policy, which will be shared with UK government imminently and published in due course\". A spokesperson for the Bermuda government said it was \"in the process of taking the necessary steps, both legislative and operational, towards the implementation of a legitimate interest access beneficial ownership register\". A spokesperson for the UK Foreign Office said: \"This government has made tackling illicit finance in the UK and our overseas territories and crown dependencies a priority since day one. \"All overseas territories are making progress and officials remain in contact with governments to ensure their proposals meet the requirements of the agreement in November.\" The Guardian has approached the governments of Anguilla and Turks and Caicos for comment.",
      "ml_hf_summary": "Four British Overseas Territories – the British Virgin Islands (BVI), Bermuda, Anguilla, and Turks & Caicos – have missed an April 2023 deadline to publish plans for improving corporate transparency by allowing access to company ownership data for those with a \"legitimate interest.\"  The BVI, despite being named in international investigations into financial wrongdoing, launched a cartoon mascot called Riley Right instead of introducing legislation for open beneficial ownership registers. This delay has drawn criticism from UK MPs who argue that the territories are undermining efforts to combat financial crime and money laundering. While the BVI government claims it is \"in the late stages\" of finalizing its policy, Bermuda stated it is taking steps towards implementing a legitimate interest access register. The UK Foreign Office maintains that all overseas territories are making progress on this issue.  \n\n\n"

      "summary": "Song made famous by Aretha Franklin is on military band’s set list for handover of chancellery to Friedrich Merz",
      "content": "The German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, is to be played out of office by a military band who will perform tunes chosen by him that are intended to sum up his mood and political life. Scholz will bow out to the Beatles, Johann Sebastian Bach and an Otis Redding hit made famous by Aretha Franklin. The 66-year-old will hand over office on Tuesday to Friedrich Merz, whose centre-right conservatives won Germany's federal election in February, and who will lead a coalition with Scholz's Social Democrats. In a tradition going back to the 16th century, chancellors, presidents, defence ministers and military generals are given a farewell ceremony, and their chosen playlist always receives much scrutiny. According to tradition, Scholz was allowed to request three pieces of music that will be performed by the band of the armed forces. On the programme is the Beatles' In My Life, seen as a nod to his earlier political life when he was mayor of the northern port city of Hamburg between 2011 and 2018, where the Liverpool musicians cut their teeth in its clubs and bars in the 1960s. Some commentators have suggested the song, the lyrics of which include the line \"of all these friends and lovers, there is no one compares with you\", is also a tribute to his wife, the fellow politician Britta Ernst, to whom he has often expressed his affection and gratitude. An excerpt from Bach's second Brandenburg Concertos, his only classical choice, is a likely reference to the state of Brandenburg, where he lives and which he will continue to serve as a backbencher. He was the only Social Democrat to win a direct mandate in the former communist east, where the far-right Alternative fur Deutschland more or less swept the board. The song choice that has caused the most mirth is the feminist anthem Respect, made famous by Franklin, which alludes to a keyword of the election campaign that brought him to power in 2021, and which he has repeated often. Critics say he has not always lived up to the motto himself, having sometimes been gruff or appearing dismissive to journalists in particular. Commentators have said Scholz's musical choices offer a rare glimpse into the emotional side of the chancellor, who was often referred to as a \"Scholzomat\" due to his robotic-like responses, and whose old black leather briefcase became something of a TikTok star while he stayed in the background. Referring to him as a \"file carrier\" in a farewell column, Franz Josef Wagner, a veteran columnist for the tabloid Bild, said Scholz's inability to communicate had probably contributed to the brevity of his tenure as chancellor, which lasted just over three years. \"Dear departing chancellor, if you had told us everything that went on in your heart, you would maybe still be chancellor today. But your mouth was sealed. You had a silent heart,\" he wrote. Scholz's immediate predecessor Angela Merkel chose Nina Hagen's 1974 hit You Forgot the Colour Film, a mix of nostalgia for holidays on the Baltic coast and a critique of grey life in communist Germany; the chanson Red Roses Should Rain for Me, a 1968 hit by the German actor Hildegard Knef; and Great God, We Praise You, a 17th-century ecumenical hymn. Among the choices of her predecessor, the Social Democrat Gerhard Schroder, was Frank Sinatra's My Way.",
      "ml_hf_summary": "German Chancellor Olaf Scholz will be leaving office on Tuesday, October 24th, 2023, and handing over to Friedrich Merz, leader of the center-right conservatives who won the February federal election.  As part of a centuries-old tradition, Scholz chose three pieces of music for his farewell ceremony: The Beatles' \"In My Life,\" Johann Sebastian Bach's Second Brandenburg Concerto, and Aretha Franklin's \"Respect.\"  Scholz's selections have been analyzed by commentators as reflecting his political life, personal relationships, and campaign themes. His predecessor, Angela Merkel, chose a diverse playlist including Nina Hagen, Hildegard Knef, and a 17th-century hymn.  \n\n\n"

      "published": "2025-05-05",
      "summary": "Players have had enough of rule 6(b) of the sport’s code, which requres a ‘skirt/skort/divided skirt’",
      "content": "They are called skorts - a portmanteau of shorts and skirts - and the Irish camogie players who are obliged to wear them have had enough. Players from Dublin and Kilkenny instead wore forbidden shorts before a provincial game on Saturday, in a coordinated protest that has won support from politicians and commentators who say the dress rules for the female-only sport are archaic. The players say skorts are uncomfortable and deter girls and women from taking up camogie, a female version of the Gaelic game of hurling, but the sport's ruling body insists upon the garment, which is considered more feminine than shorts. Niamh Gannon, the captain of Dublin's camogie team, told RTE: \"Players have spoken out about the effect this has had on their mental health, just in terms of not being comfortable or confident seeing pictures after games of themselves in skorts. \"And there are young girls, who have said that they've stopped playing camogie because they don't feel comfortable. In no other area in our lives are we told that we have to wear something that resembles a skirt.\" After years of complaints about rule 6(b) of the sport's code, which says players must wear a \"skirt/skort/divided skirt\", Dublin and Kilkenny players turned up at their provincial Leinster semi-final in shorts. After the referee threatened to abandon the game, they changed into skorts. But the protest has ignited wider calls for the Camogie Association of Ireland to drop the rule. Simon Harris, Ireland's tanaiste, said on X: \"Rules forcing camogie players to wear skorts while playing are archaic. Players have made their views clearly known.\" Alan Kelly, the chair of the Irish parliament's sports committee, said he would like to invite the Camogie Association to address the issue before the committee. He said: \"It's bananas that in today's day and age there are rules forcing our camogie players to wear skorts rather than their preferred choice of clothing when playing matches. \"We can't continue to ignore this. No sportsperson should have to tog out in gear that's unsuitable and uncomfortable.\" The hybrid garment comprises an overlapping fabric panel over tight, compressor-type shorts, giving the impression of a skirt. In a recent Gaelic Players Association (GPA) survey, 70% of respondents cited \"discomfort\" while wearing skorts and 83% wished to have a choice between shorts and skorts. Aisling Maher, a co-chair of the GPA, said she loved the game but skorts were unfit for purpose. \"In no other facet of my life does someone dictate that I have to wear something resembling a skirt because I am a girl. Why is it happening in my sport?\" she said. Camogie players at London's Gaelic Games Association club Thomas McCurtains launched a Shorts Not Skorts campaign in 2023. But a majority of delegates at the Camogie Association of Ireland's annual congress last year rejected two motions to amend the rule. In a statement on Sunday, the association said a democratic vote had retained the rule and a working group was examining playing wear. It said: \"A wide range of national and international manufactured skorts have been sourced. Testing of these skorts for comfort, fit and design will begin in mid-May and will include adult and juvenile players from club and county teams, as well as referees.\"",
      "ml_hf_summary": "On Saturday, camogie players from Dublin and Kilkenny wore shorts instead of the required skorts during a provincial semi-final game. This protest was a response to rule 6(b) of the Camogie Association of Ireland's code, which mandates that players wear a \"skirt/skort/divided skirt.\" Players argue that skorts are uncomfortable and discourage participation, while the association maintains that they are more feminine.  A recent GPA survey found that 70% of respondents cited discomfort with skorts and 83% desired a choice between shorts and skorts. The protest has garnered support from politicians like Simon Harris and Alan Kelly, who have called for the rule to be reconsidered. The Camogie Association stated they are examining playing wear through a working group that will test various skort designs for comfort and fit starting in mid-May. \n\n\n"

      "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/05/pope-francis-mixed-legacy-women-catholic-church",
      "published": "2025-05-05",
      "summary": "He made strides in boosting female workforce in Vatican but also insisted women could never become priests",
      "content": "Just a few days before he died, Pope Francis met nurses and medics from Rome's Gemelli hospital, where for five weeks he had been treated for severe pneumonia, to thank them for their care. Leading the group of 70 men and women was Elena Beccalli, who in June last year became the first female rector of Milan's Catholic University of the Sacred Heart. The university's health faculty in Rome has close ties with Gemelli. \"Thank you for the service in hospital, it was very good, keep it up,\" Francis told the group, before turning to Becalli and adding: \"When women are in charge, things go well!\" It was not the first time Francis had publicly praised the role of women, and throughout his 12-year papacy he made strides in boosting the female workforce in the Vatican while appointing several women into the top echelons of its governance. He also gave women the right to vote during synods, the periodic Vatican summits involving the world's bishops. But in other areas, whether it be the handling of accusations of clerical abuse of nuns or his repeated assertions that women could never become priests, Francis leaves behind a disparate legacy. That women are still mostly passive participants in the church was made clear by their absence during his funeral mass in St Peter's Square among the mourners filling the seats surrounding the altar and front rows on the side of the pulpit reserved for Catholic church leaders. Instead, nuns stood among crowds of pilgrims and tourists, mostly making do with following the service on TV screens. Meanwhile, the theme of women has so far been missing from the discussion among cardinals as they share visions for the future of the church during their daily pre-conclave meetings, at least according to briefings given to the press by a Vatican official. But as the men prepare to enter the Sistine Chapel to elect a new pope on Wednesday, all the while capturing the world's attention, a team of women will be working behind the scenes to support them. In a mission led by the sisters who manage Casa Santa Marta, the guesthouse where the 133 sequestered cardinal-voters will reside during the conclave, their task will be to cook for the men and clean their bedrooms. The nuns will also assist them in managing their daily needs, especially the more frail among them, while providing spiritual support for their electoral duty through prayer. \"It is the women who actually hold everything together,\" said Gloria Branciani, a former nun. \"But the Catholic church remains a patriarchal institution where women are barely even listened to.\" Branciani should know. She left the nunhood after allegedly being sexually abused for years - including being forced into having threesomes - by Marko Rupnik, a once-prominent Jesuit artist-priest who was friends with Francis. Rupnik, who has been accused of abuse by at least nine women, was excommunicated in 2020 for absolving a woman with whom he had sex, only to be reinstated after he repented. Rupnik was finally expelled from the Jesuit order in June 2023 after the \"degree of credibility\" of the allegations against him was found to be \"very high\". However, he remains a priest and is now based at a diocese in Koper, in his native Slovenia. Branciani had long reported the abuse, but claimed she was never listened to. There was hope in 2019 when Francis became the first pontiff to publicly admit that priests had sexually abused nuns, but he failed in his pledge to do more to fight the problem. The Rupnik case is with the Dicastery for the Doctrine of the Faith, the Vatican body responsible for overseeing the church's prosecution of serious crimes. But it has been slow to progress, with Rupnik's alleged victims being told that judges were deterred from taking on the case because the women had spoken to the press. \"Gloria made the first complaint in 1993, and if it had been dealt with at that time we would never have needed to turn to the media ... and how many victims would have been spared?\" said Laura Sgro, a lawyer representing Bracciani and other alleged victims, and the author of a recently published book about the case, Stupri Sacri (Sacred Rapes). Sister Livia Angelillis, a nun based in Tuscany, said the problem of clerical abuse against nuns had always been there, \"whether in a light or heavy form\". \"They were afraid to speak out - nuns tend to view priests as Jesus on Earth,\" she said. \"But Francis's acknowledgment has at least given more women the courage to report it.\" The major obstacle limiting the power of women in the church is the ban on them becoming priests. \"They don't have voices,\" said Sgro. The battle for female priests has long been fought by the Catholic Women's Ordination (CWO), a global organisation that challenges misogyny in the church. Pat Brown, a spokesperson for CWO, said that while Francis was \"wonderful\" in so many ways, he appeared to have a blind spot when it came to giving women \"justice\". \"There is absolutely no argument why women can't be priests - it is misogyny,\" she said. Justice is exactly what Branciani would like to see from the next pope. \"Words are all well and good but we need substance, starting with an immediate trial [against Rupnik]. But real reforms can only really begin once women can train to become priests.\"",
      "ml_hf_summary": "Pope Francis met with nurses and medical staff from Rome's Gemelli hospital, where he received treatment for pneumonia, expressing gratitude for their care.  During his papacy, Francis made strides in increasing the female workforce and representation within the Vatican, including granting women voting rights during synods. However, he also maintained traditional stances on women's roles, such as barring them from priesthood. While women played crucial behind-the-scenes roles during the papal conclave, their presence was largely absent from public proceedings.  The legacy of Francis' papacy regarding women in the church remains complex, marked by both progress and continued limitations. \n\n\n"

      "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/05/salvage-operation-to-recover-mike-lynch-superyacht-the-bayesian-begins-off-sicily",
      "published": "2025-05-05",
      "summary": "British tech entrepreneur and his daughter were among seven killed when the Bayesian sank in a violent storm",
      "content": "A 55-metre (180ft) barge carrying a heavy-lift crane has begun work to raise the British-flagged superyacht Bayesian from the seabed off Sicily, where it sank last summer killing seven people including the UK tech entrepreneur Mike Lynch. The barge, named Hebo Lift 2, with its 700-sq-metre deck, specialist diving apparatus and a remotely operated underwater vehicle, arrived last week in Porticello, a fishing port near Palermo, where marine salvage experts have started operations to raise the Bayesian. On 19 August 2024, the 56-metre yacht was anchored just off Porticello when the vessel was struck by a violent storm shortly before dawn and sank. Lynch, once described as Britain's Bill Gates, and his 18-year-old daughter, Hannah, were among the victims. Morgan Stanley's international chair, Jonathan Bloomer, and his wife, Judy, also died along with the US lawyer Chris Morvillo and his wife, Neda, and boat's chef Recaldo Thomas. Fifteen people survived, including Lynch's wife, Angela Bacares, whose company owned the Bayesian. Experts expect the salvage operation to be fiendishly complex. \"The mobilisation of this specialist salvage consortium and key lifting assets follows a detailed assessment of the best technical methodology to safely recover Bayesian,\" said Marcus Cave, a director of the British-based consultancy TMC Marine, which will oversee a consortium of expert salvage specialists undertaking the project. \"Every marine salvage operation requires unique planning considerations, given the specific marine conditions, and this is no different. The safety of personnel on site, environmental protection and recovery of Bayesian intact, have been pivotal to the planning and decision-making process.\" The wreckage sits at a depth of 50 metres in the bay of Porticello, which is under surveillance by Italian authorities. During the recovery, salvage workers will use undersea drones with laser scanners with Hebo Lift 2 remotely operating underwater with specialist diving equipment. Offshore, the Hebo Lift 10 - one of Europe's largest floating cranes - which is not yet involved in the operations, will use its 83-metre boom to hoist the yacht from the seabed. \"Once mobilised on site, these dedicated lifting assets will be supported by specialist anti-pollution experts and assets that have been monitoring Bayesian since her sinking,\" TMC Marine said in a statement. \"They will help to continue to ensure that protection of the marine life and environment is maintained throughout the recovery of the Bayesian.\" To facilitate the lift, the 72-metre, 24-tonne mainmast will be cut away. Once raised, the vessel will be towed to Termini Imerese, where prosecutors have opened an inquiry into suspected manslaughter. The Bayesian's captain, James Cutfield, a New Zealander, and two British crew members, Tim Parker Eaton and Matthew Griffiths, have been placed under investigation. In Italy this does not imply guilt or mean formal charges will necessarily follow. Investigators hope the yacht will yield vital clues: whether a series of human errors led to the sinking, as initially suspected, or whether other factors were at play. Once ashore, forensic examination will determine whether one of the hatches remained open and if the keel was improperly raised. Sicilian port officials have declared a 650-metre exclusion zone around the sunken vessel, forbidding \"any navigation, anchoring, diving, swimming or fishing until the work is complete\". Insurers estimate the salvage will cost about $30m (PS22.4m), a bill the Bayesian's underwriters will pick up. The Italian coastguard, which is supervising operations and patrolling the security perimeter, said the overall operation to recover the Bayesian could take from 20 to 25 days, weather permitting.",

      "summary": "Shorter winters and thinning ice are imperiling cultural activities in the north, including hockey, broomball and hunting",
      "content": "Janelle Oombash stands on the smooth ice of an outdoor rink, keeping score and watching the time as two teams of teenagers run across the ice, whacking a ball with sticks under the afternoon sun. Outside the rink, a bonfire crackles, keeping spectators warm as they watch the game. Broomball has been played for more than a century in northern Ontario. The game is similar to hockey, but players use a ball instead of a puck and wear specialized shoes rather than skates. Now 31, Oombash started playing the game at age 11. Her dad is a coach and taught her to play. \"It's a big sport. Everybody plays broomball or hockey,\" she said. Oombash organized today's broomball tournament in Cat Lake First Nation, a remote Ojibway community of 650 people nestled about 500km north of Lake Superior as a way to encourage teenagers to socialize. She pointed at two boys on the same team. \"These boys here, you would never see them talk. But in broomball, they can play together. They get along very well,\" she said. But these broomball games are becoming a rare occurrence. Cat Lake has no indoor arena, affording them only a few weeks of ice each winter. \"We used to have tournaments every few weeks, but we haven't been able to do that because the ice goes bad really early,\" Oombash said. \"It's been disappointing.\" The outdoor rink opened in early February but then closed for a week due to warm temperatures, cancelling broomball and hockey practice for adults as they prepared to travel outside the community for competitive regional tournaments. \"That was supposed to be the week we had practice, but we cut it because of how warm it was,\" she explained. \"We don't know how long we're going to have this ice.\" The climate crisis is piling increasing pressure on Indigenous communities' constitutionally protected rights and traditions. Global heating is changing the migration patterns of animals that are crucial sources of food, and endangering sacred plants such as sage, burned in ceremonies, and black ash, used to weave baskets and make medicine. In northern Ontario, warming temperatures are threatening wintertime events such as broomball, hockey, ice fishing and goose hunting. Shorter winter seasons and disappearing ice are forcing subarctic communities to adapt. \"I'm hoping they build an arena so we could play all year round,\" Oombash said. \"Because we all know the climate is going to change. We all know it's going to get warmer and warmer.\" The landscape of northern Ontario consists of evergreen forests and spongy muskeg cut through by intertwined lakes and rivers. Dozens of remote First Nations are scattered across the north, accessible only by plane and thousands of kilometres of ice roads. In winter, the lakes freeze solid and snow cloaks the landscape, allowing people to travel overland to hunting camps. Winter is prime hunting season in Eabametoong First Nation, a remote community of about 1,600 people. It's the time of year that the lake surrounding the community freezes solid, enabling people to drive across and join family members in nearby communities for hunting trips. In March, Eabametoong resident Martha Papah was looking forward to spending the weekend at her adult son's hunting camp in the neighbouring community of Neskantaga. They planned to hunt beaver for meat and pelts, which can be made into blankets, hats or gloves. Beaver is a delicacy in winter because the animals haven't yet had the chance to eat plants that make their meat bitter. \"This time of year is good if you want to have beaver,\" she said. To reach Neskantaga, Papah must drive over an ice road that crosses a 5.5km-wide frozen lake, with ice that has become thinner and more treacherous in recent years. \"I'm excited, and at the same time, you have to be on guard on the ice road. We drive really slow when we cross the lake. It's dangerous for us,\" she said. There is no all-season road connecting the two communities and no direct flights. To visit her son without a winter road, Papah would need to fly 360km south to Thunder Bay, and then 420km north to Neskantaga, at a cost of C$1,500 (US$1,085) round trip. \"It's much cheaper to go on the winter road,\" she said. Warmer temperatures are especially affecting the spring goose hunt. In fall, Canadian geese flock south in iconic V-shape formations, returning in spring to their northern breeding grounds. It's the one time of year that geese gorge themselves to prepare for migration and breeding, which means more meat on the birds for hunters. This meat provides not only a traditional source of food, but an alternative to expensive groceries at the Northern Store. In April, hunters and their families travel to camps, where they shoot geese and cook the meat over campfires. They typically travel by snowmobile across the frozen land. But in recent years, open water has appeared along the lakes and rivers, cutting off travel. \"Global warming has disrupted every activity we do, like hunting for sustenance. So it's becoming really difficult,\" said Solomon Atlookan, Eabametoong's chief. \"We used to go to our traditional territory way 'til late April on a snowmobile, and we had a lot of snow,\" he said. \"In the last five years, none of us have gone there, to go spend a week and hunt geese during their migration, because there's no snow.\" Eabametoong resident John Meeseetawaygeesic spends months each year out on the land, hunting, fishing and trapping - activities he shares on social media to followers all over the world. But travelling overland is riskier these days. \"I have to be cautious, I have to take my time and have to be careful,\" he said. \"It's not the way it used to be. Used to go anywhere before, but not now. You have to observe everywhere you go now. It's dangerous now.\" He said the April goose hunt was more complicated now. \"Because of the ice melting, we can't really go anywhere. Years ago, when the ice was good and the snow was there, we would be everywhere. But now we can't really do that because the ice has been melting too fast.\" He added that migration patterns of animals were changing. \"We're not catching anything, and now we don't know where the animals are going.\" On 7 March, Meeseetawaygeesic boarded a small, 40-seat plane. He gripped the arms of his seat as the plane lifted off the short runway. These bumpy, low-flying planes make him nervous. When he's not hunting, Meeseetawaygeesic coaches the local men's hockey team, Pick Your Poison. He and his teammates boarded the plane heading south to Thunder Bay, toward their final destination of Dryden, Ontario. Held in March every year, the Northern men's hockey tournament in Dryden is the biggest event of the year for hockey teams in the north. \"We've been hitting all the tournaments this winter, so I think we're ready for the big one.,\" Meeseetawaygeesic said. The previous week, Pick Your Poison won a smaller tournament and used the prize money to pay for their flights. Normally, hockey players from northern communities drive south along ice roads to reach the big tournament, but these routes are becoming unreliable. A few nights earlier, Meeseetawaygeesic's truck got stranded on a winter road. Warm temperatures made the road's snowy surface softer than usual, and his truck became trapped in the snow. So they had to fly. The winter roads that freeze each year make it cheaper for teams to travel to tournaments. But spring is arriving earlier each year, cutting short the winter road season. \"With climate change, some of the reserves up north will have a hard time going home after the tournament next week because of the melting of the snow and ice,\" he said. To motivate his team, Meeseetawaygeesic tells them: \"Play hard, play smart, have fun. Winning is not everything. Even losing is not everything. It's a matter of being out there and enjoying yourself and meeting other people.\" After arriving in Dryden, Pick Your Poison went on to win the championship in the B-side division.

      "published": "2025-05-05",
      "summary": "In today’s newsletter: The Australian election saw a remarkable comeback for Anthony Albanese’s Labor party – and a crushing defeat for Peter Dutton and the Liberal-led Coalition",
      "content": "Good morning. Last week, a left-of-centre party that had looked to be on the ropes triumphed after an astonishing turnaround partly triggered by the reverberations from Donald Trump's arrival in the White House - and the Trump-adjacent leader of the rightwing party faced the humiliation of losing his seat. Well, it's happened again. The Australian election was different from the Canadian one in a lot of ways. But a second term for Anthony Albanese and the Labor party, and such a crushing defeat for the Coalition leader, Peter Dutton, is a significant result - the first time an Australian prime minister has won a second term in 21 years, coming even as a growing number of voters turn their backs on the main parties. Labor's victory will strengthen the case of those who think that offering a moderate alternative to the kind of chaotic politics unleashed by Trump is the right approach for progressive parties - but, as the news of far right success in Romania in the headlines below suggests, that is not a universal playbook. We'll return to Romania in the weeks ahead. For today's newsletter, I asked Lenore Taylor, editor of Guardian Australia, to unpack what just happened, what to expect from the returning Labor government, and whether the right will conclude that it's time to abandon a Trumpist approach. Here are the headlines. Five big stories UK politics | The sacked former transport secretary Louise Haigh has urged Keir Starmer to avoid a \"simplistic and naive\" lurch to the right after Reform UK's success in the local elections. Haigh, the most senior Labour MP to publicly criticise the party's strategy, said that Labour was \"shying away from the battles that we need to have\". Romania | An ultranationalist who opposes military aid to Ukraine, has vilified the EU's leaders, and calls himself Donald Trump's \"natural ally\" has won the first round of Romania's rerun presidential vote and will face a centrist in the runoff. George Simion's far-right Alliance for the Union of Romanians (AUR) began as an anti-vax movement during the pandemic. Middle East | Israel will strike back against Yemen's Houthis after a missile fired by the militia movement hit close to Tel Aviv's Ben Gurion airport on Sunday. The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said Israel would respond to the attack \"at a time and place of our choosing\". Terrorism | Eight men, including four Iranian nationals, have been arrested in armed anti-terrorist raids in England. Some of the suspects were planning a terrorist plot, police allege, amid growing concern about Tehran-backed plots in the UK. Greens | A leading Green has launched a surprise campaign to oust Carla Denyer and Adrian Ramsay as party leaders, saying the party needs to transform itself into a radical, mass-membership \"eco-populism\" movement. Deputy leader Zack Polanski said: \"We should never turn into Nigel Farage. But there are things we can learn in terms of being really clear in speaking to people.\" In depth: Collapse of conservative vote hands Labor a thumping victory As recently as February, YouGov's MRP poll gave a 1% chance of a Labor government; by last week, that figure had rocketed to 97%. But while some models pointed to Labor being the largest party in a hung parliament, even the most optimistic analysts on the left didn't expect the 85 seats (out of 151 in total) that they are on track to win, with the potential for even more in the final tally. The result is a renewed Labor government that will not need to rely on the support of smaller parties or independents to govern - and a rare moment of stability in Australian politics. \"It's an extraordinary achievement to win two terms in office,\" Lenore Taylor said. \"Albanese has a lot of political capital to spend now, and it'll be very interesting to see how he does it.\" *** How did it happen? You might imagine that an outright majority for the government would be an indication of a settled two-party system. But the evidence of the votes suggests that this was much more a story of disaster for the Coalition, the long-term right-leaning alliance of the Liberal and National parties, led by the Liberals. \"What happened above anything else is that the conservative vote collapsed,\" Lenore Taylor said. In this data analysis of the result, Nick Evershed points out that despite Labor's success, once all the votes are tallied, more than a third of Australians may have voted for someone other than a Labor or Coalition candidate for the first time. It's too early to have a firm understanding of why the polls overestimated Coalition support. \"They all got burned in 2019, when they were absolutely sure Labor would win, and they were wrong,\" Lenore said. \"My suspicion is that they overcorrected their methodology, but we don't know that yet.\" An important factor in all this is Australia's compulsory preferential voting system, which asks voters to rank their choices, eliminating the last-placed candidate until someone has a majority. (Here's a useful explainer.) \"When a third of the electorate is not voting for a major party, and you have a compulsory system, it's really tricky to predict,\" Lenore said. \"People who aren't engaged in politics but still have to vote are hard to poll accurately.\" *** What does the result tell us about Labor and the Coalition? In an election dominated by housing and cost of living concerns, Albanese will feel vindicated for a steady, centrist approach despite the apparent threat on his left from the Greens (who ended up losing seats, and blamed it on Liberals in their target constituencies lending their votes to Labor). \"Things changed a lot during the course of the campaign, but Labor stuck to its plan,\" Lenore said. \"There was a mood of aversion to conflict: Albanese promised to oversee a reforming government, but not a radical government.\" The result was a \"thumping victory for Labor. But it's important to say that they had some good fortune: interest rates and petrol prices have come down recently, and the Liberal party comprehensively screwed it up.\" On that subject: \"Their policies were really poorly thought through,\" Lenore said. \"Dutton opposed a top-up tax cut introduced by Labor and presented himself as more fiscally responsible - and then a week later he announced his own tax rebate and a petrol tax cut even though prices were coming down anyway.\" The Coalition actually had higher deficits projected for the next two years than Labor, not lower. \"The view of Dutton you heard a lot from people was that he was all over the shop. The whole thing didn't add up.\" Sure enough, voters in his own constituency booted him out after 24 years. (He was gracious in defeat to Labor's Ali France, a disability advocate who lost her leg in a car accident in 2011, and whose son Henry died of leukaemia last year. You can read more about her here, and see her remarkable tribute to Henry in her acceptance speech here.) The contrast between the pitches from the two sides worked out badly for the Coalition in a time when many Australians believe the economy has turned a corner: \"Dutton kept saying, do you feel better off than three years ago? Whereas Labor were saying, this is how we will make you better off in three years' time.\" In this piece, political historian Judith Brett reflects on the dire position the Liberal party now finds itself in, perhaps as bad as any in its history since the Second World War. *** How significant an impact did Donald Trump have? It's not long since Dutton was quite happy to take a tone that was strikingly reminiscent of Trump and the Maga movement: he has praised Trump's grasp of \"the art of the deal\" over his suggestion that the US could take over Gaza; proposed a Doge-style government efficiency unit; promised to slash the education department; warned that young men are being \"disenfranchised and ostracised\" by diversity initiatives; and vowed a \"war on woke\". He has also called Guardian Australia and national broadcaster the ABC \"hate media\". All of that earned him the excellent nickname Temu Trump, in honour of the Chinese website known for cheap knock-offs of well known brands. The Coalition's approach was modelled on the referendum over the Indigenous Voice proposal - a plan to establish a formal body for Indigenous people to advise on laws that was resoundingly defeated in 2023. \"The Coalition ran a very nasty, negative campaign against the Indigenous Voice proposals, and they thought that that would be a template for a successful federal campaign,\" Lenore said. \"But then the reality of Trump governing hits, and suddenly that doesn't work any more.\" Trump's ascent was not directly at issue in Australia in the same way it was in Canada - but, said Lenore, \"it was incredibly influential background music. It's not like people were thinking about him as they cast their vote for the most part. But his return to office has made that kind of politics anathema. And it may also be a sense of it being better to stick with the devil you know in an unstable wider world.\" *** What does the result mean for climate policies? Australia's per capita greenhouse gas emissions are the highest in the OECD, and the country is also one of the biggest exporters of fossil fuels - so climate policy really matters. In this piece published on Friday, Adam Morton lays out the stark differences between the two sides - even if neither is exactly inspiring for climate campaigners. The Coalition's climate policies have been a significant victim of their vacation of the centre ground, Lenore said. \"For as long as I can remember, the internal conflict has been between people who are climate sceptics and those who believe they need a credible policy. Their promise to build seven nuclear reactors in 10 years and do literally nothing in the meantime was not taken seriously. Nobody thought they would get built - it was climate scepticism in a thin disguise.\" Now, Albanese's climate policies - executed without the pressure of a Green bloc in government - will be a key measure of how he will govern. \"He went into the last election promising to fix environmental laws that are not fit for purpose, but then it looked like doing that would cost them some seats, and it was shelved. Progressives will want him to return to serious climate action now - to roll out renewables further and faster, and to announce a renewed 2035 emissions reduction target.\" What else we've been reading A wonderful birthday tribute to the Goat of national treasures David Attenborough: 99 nature lovers - one to mark each year of Sir David's life - pay tribute including Barack Obama, Jane Fonda, Margaret Atwood and Billie Eilish.

      "ml_hf_summary": "Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and his Labor party secured a second term in office with a decisive victory over the Coalition led by Peter Dutton.  Labor won 85 out of 151 seats, securing an outright majority and avoiding reliance on smaller parties for governance. This outcome marks the first time an Australian prime minister has won a second term in 21 years. The Coalition's defeat was attributed to poorly conceived policies and internal conflicts, while Labor benefited from a steady, centrist approach and a favorable economic climate.  The election results also reflect a growing trend of voters turning away from traditional parties, with over a third potentially voting for candidates outside the major parties. \n\n\nLabor's victory is seen as a potential setback for right-wing populism in Australia, which had been gaining traction under Dutton's leadership.

Kwok, 28, is the executive director of the Washington-based Hong Kong Democracy Council, and is one of 19 overseas activists wanted by the national security police, who are offering bounties of HK$1m (PS97,000) for information leading to arrest. Kwok's father, 68, and her brother, 35, were arrested on 30 April on suspicion of \"attempting to deal with directly or indirectly, any funds or other financial assets or economic resources belonging to, or owned or controlled by, a relevant absconder\". The police said the men were suspected of helping Kwok to change the details of a life insurance policy and withdraw its remaining value. Kwok's father was charged and detained while her brother was released on bail pending further investigations. Yalkun Uluyol, China researcher at Human Rights Watch, said: \"The Chinese government has increased its appalling use of collective punishment against family members of peaceful activists from Hong Kong. The Hong Kong authorities should immediately and unconditionally release Anna Kwok's father and cease harassing families of Hong Kong activists.\" ChinaAid, a US-based human rights group, said: \"This represents a deeply unsettling and significant escalation of the ongoing retaliatory actions against the families of exiled activists ... this is a blatant attempt to silence overseas dissidents by targeting their family members at home, a tactic that brazenly disregards fundamental human rights and the rule of law.\" Police in Hong Kong have repeatedly questioned the relatives of exiled activists. In recent months relatives of Tony Chung, Frances Hui and Carmen Lau, overseas pro-democracy activists who are also wanted by the Hong Kong police, have been questioned. Chung and Lau, who are in the UK, have both had threatening letters sent to their neighbours offering rewards for information leading to their capture. The arrests in Kwok's case mark the first time that relatives have been criminally charged. Kwok's father faces a sentence of up to seven years in prison if convicted. He has been denied bail with the case adjourned to 13 June, according to Reuters. The Hong Kong police and the Hong Kong Democracy Council did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

      "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/05/greece-booming-tourist-economy-workers",
      "published": "2025-05-05",
      "summary": "About 80,000 jobs still to be filled – and country is turning to asylum seekers and overseas for help",
      "content": "On the facade of the Karyatis taverna in a plaza of palm trees and garden plants beneath the Acropolis, the notice says it all: \"Seeking staff, chefs, waiters, kitchen personnel.\" With record numbers of tourists slated this summer to visit Athens, the restaurant's owners are not taking any chances. \"It's becoming harder and harder to find employees,\" said Dimitris Stathokostopoulos, who runs the eatery with his brother. \"Tourism is definitely on the rise but these days Greeks prefer to work 9 to 5 office jobs that don't require putting in hours at night, or over the weekend.\" In the countdown to the season getting into full swing, the search for staff to keep the industry afloat has assumed an unexpected urgency. Greece may be among Europe's most popular destinations but workers are in short supply. Shortages are such that just weeks away from tourists flying in, an estimated 80,000 work slots have yet to be filled in the food and hotel sector - the backbone of an industry that, at 25% of GDP, is the engine of the Greek economy. Stathokostopoulos is not the only entrepreneur struggling to find staff to meet the demands of the popular taverna at what is likely to be the busiest time of the year. Nationwide, hoteliers are in race to find front desk managers, cleaners, lifeguards, door staff, waiters and cooks. On big-draw islands such as Crete and Rhodes, reports of hoteliers poaching employees from competitors with promises of better pay and work conditions have soared. \"It's partly a legacy of the [Covid-19] pandemic, which all of Europe has felt but in Greece the problem is particularly acute,\" said Giorgos Hotzoglou, president of the Panhellenic Federation of Workers in Food Service and Tourism (POEET). \"What we're seeing is an unprecedented lack of qualified and experienced workers, especially in the hotel and food industry, following the exodus of employees during the lockdown. Many never returned. As a result an estimated 80,000 jobs are now needed.\" For Hotzoglou the sector's seasonality is to blame. \"Once the season is over workers are entitled to only three months of unemployment benefit. When there's a cost of living crisis, how are they expected the rest of the year to possibly survive?\" Tourism is not the only sector hit by the labour shortages. Construction and agriculture have also been affected by the scarcity in a country not only confronting a dramatic demographic decline but still reeling from the exodus of more than 500,000 mostly high-skilled students and workers at the height of its near decade-long economic crisis. In a bid to address the problem, partly because of pressure from local MPs, the centre-right government has sought to legalise the status of about 30,000 unregistered migrants. It has also signed an array of bilateral agreements \"for labour mobility\" with third countries including Egypt, Vietnam, Bangladesh, Georgia, India and Moldova. \"I've just received a recruitment offer from a company in Dubai that I'm considering,\" said Stathokostopoulos. \"A Bangladeshi is working in our kitchen and he's excellent. It's people from Asia and other parts of the world who are now applying for this type of work.\" Asylum seekers, until recently languishing in refugee facilities, will take up jobs in northern Greece later this month after being trained by the Hellenic Hotel Association - a groundbreaking step in a nation where the coastguard and other officials have been accused by human rights groups of illegal pushbacks to keep migrants at bay. Since assuming the helm of the migration ministry in March, Makis Voridis, a former far-right student activist, has vowed to expel \"illegal migrants\", tightening a government policy that takes a \"tough but fair\" approach to immigration. \"It's inconceivable that we're discussing an increasing number of deportations when statistics show that in Greece 750,000 work positions will need filling by 2050,\" said Sofia Kouvelaki, who heads the Home Project, an organisation that supports refugee and migrant children in Athens. \"More than 1,400 kids have passed through our shelters and hundreds have thrived when given the opportunity in often very high-skilled jobs.\" It is not lost on officials that Greece's dilemma has also been spurred by its own success: in a resurgent economy that is also one of the fastest growing in Europe, unemployment rates have halved, dropping from 18% to 9%, over the past six years. \"Five hundred thousand new jobs have been created in areas ranging from construction to logistics, retail services and healthcare,\" said Spiros Protopsaltis, the governor of the Greek public employment service, DYPA. \"The rhetoric around job vacancies is, I think, a little inflated but there are still untapped sources of labour ... starting with women.\" Time is of the essence. By 2028, Athens' tourism ministry has forecast 40 million visitors - nearly four times the country's population - a result of increased arrivals mostly from the emerging markets of India and China. The tourist season is also lengthening as travel habits change with climate change. Greece has begun actively recruiting abroad, holding career day job fairs in Germany, Holland and the UK. In addition to foreigners, the hope is that Greeks who left during the financial crisis will also return, said Protopsaltis. \"We tell people: 'come back,'\" he said. \"The Greek economy is not what you remember. It's doing very well.\"",
      "ml_hf_summary": "Greece faces a significant labor shortage in its tourism sector, with an estimated 80,000 unfilled positions in food and hotel services weeks before the peak season. This shortage stems from several factors, including the COVID-19 pandemic's impact on employment and Greece's demographic decline.  To address this issue, the government is seeking to legalize the status of unregistered migrants and has signed labor mobility agreements with countries like Egypt, Vietnam, and Bangladesh. Additionally, Greece is actively recruiting abroad through job fairs in Europe and hopes that Greeks who left during the financial crisis will return. The tourism sector is crucial to Greece's economy, contributing 25% to its GDP, and the government aims to attract 40 million visitors by 2028.  \n\n\n"

      "summary": "Exclusive account reveals previously unreported details and insights into how Kremlin’s sabotage campaign played out on the ground – and the multinational effort to track down the network behind it",
      "content": "On a frosty November morning last year, a broad-shouldered man with short grey hair staggered, exhausted, into a small guesthouse on the outskirts of Bosanska Krupa - a quaint Bosnian border town where ancient stone bridges span the emerald-green waters of the Una River. Alexander Bezrukavyi had been on the run for more than three months, pursued by European security services who accused him of working for Russia's military intelligence agency, the GRU. Bezrukavyi, 44, had set out from Croatia on foot two days earlier, navigating dense Balkan forests and rugged hills to cross into Bosnia illicitly. As evening arrived, Bezrukavyi messaged his wife, promising her that they would soon be reunited in Russia, and contacted his friend to finalise his plans for getting back home, using new forged papers and a flight from neighbouring Serbia. But a few hours later, at about 2am, a group of Bosnian intelligence officers and police burst into his room. Bezrukavyi's arrest was part of a Polish-led operation targeting a suspected Russian-backed criminal network. The cell is accused of sending parcels containing camouflaged explosives on cargo planes across Europe, triggering fires at three locations. Polish prosecutors believe Bezrukavyi was part of a plot to send shipments with explosives to the US and Canada, a brazen plan that would have marked a major escalation of a sabotage campaign that western security officials believe Moscow has unleashed over the past three years across Europe. Western security officials believe the exploding parcels could have led to a plane crash and mass casualties. When intelligence about the alleged plot reached Washington, it caused so much alarm that top officials in Joe Biden's administration had called their Russian counterparts to demand that Vladimir Putin call it off. On 13 February, three months after his arrest in Bosnia, Bezrukavyi was extradited to Poland amid much fanfare. An image published in Polish media showed a man in handcuffs, chained at the ankles, being escorted off a plane by two masked law enforcement officers. \"A Russian hiding in Bosnia-Herzegovina, suspected of coordinating acts of sabotage against Poland, the US, and other allies, was extradited to Poland and arrested by court order,\" the Polish prime minister, Donald Tusk, wrote on X. The country's interior minister described his extradition as \"a serious blow to the Russian sabotage network in Europe\". This exclusive account - based on the first known interviews with two direct participants in the parcel operations, as well as others close to Bezrukavyi's group and current and former western intelligence sources - reveals previously unreported details into how the Russian sabotage campaign played out, and the multinational effort to track down the wider network behind it. It also raises questions about the chain of command in today's Russian intelligence operations, in which staff officers tend to remain in Moscow, leaving the dirty work on the ground to proxies and recruits. The Polish prosecutor, in a statement, said Bezrukavyi would be charged \"with coordinating acts of sabotage in Poland and other countries, consisting of setting fire to buildings and sending courier packages with incendiary materials\". In communications with those close to him, Bezrukavyi has claimed he was duped - unknowingly used to deliver packages coordinated via the Telegram messaging app, without understanding their true purpose. Others in the group claimed the same. \"We were being used like blind mules,\" one of them told the Guardian. \"We were set up.\" On the run across Europe Bezrukavyi grew up in Rostov-on-Don, a Russian city near the Ukrainian border, where court records suggest he has a long history of violent offences. Over the years, he faced multiple criminal charges, including illegal possession of weapons, burglary, robbery and drug-related crimes. According to those who know him from his time in Russia, he made much of his money in various smuggling schemes in Ukraine's Donetsk region, including moving cigarettes across the separatist-controlled border into Russia. In 2019, Russian court documents show he was briefly detained and later charged with participation in an organised criminal ring. Before he could be re-arrested, he fled to Ukraine and settled in Kharkiv - a city nearly captured by Russian forces in the early days of the invasion. As the war raged, Bezrukavyi supposedly lay low in Ukraine, eventually managing to leave for Moldova on 17 February 2024, according to leaked border data. By May, he had entered the Schengen zone via Croatia, and later obtained Spanish residency through a fictitious marriage to a Ukrainian woman. \"He couldn't return to Russia because he was still wanted there, so he stayed in Europe waiting for Moscow to drop the charges,\" claimed his real wife, Natalia, in a phone interview. The Guardian has a photograph of Bezrukavyi's Spanish residency permit. From Spain, Bezrukavyi moved to Warsaw, where he hung out with a group of Ukrainian friends and acquaintances. He shared a flat on the city's outskirts with Vyacheslav Chabanenko, a clean-shaven Ukrainian, nicknamed \"Ponchik\" or \"Doughnut\" for his stocky physique, whom Bezrukavyi had met back in Kharkiv. Chabanenko also had a criminal past, allegedly spending five years in a Russian jail for beating his wife and mother-in-law. He also became friends with Serhiy Yevseyev from the Ukrainian city of Lutsk, who was later detained and is believed to have aided the operation. In the summer of 2024, the group reportedly began searching for jobs among Russian-language Telegram channels commonly used by Ukrainian refugees. Amid the legitimate job listings and housing tips, they apparently came across an anonymous account that went by the name VWarrior, which Polish authorities believe was operated by a GRU handler. The account began offering courier jobs paying hundreds of dollars per assignment. A close associate of Bezrukavyi who supplied cars for the operation disclosed new details of the parcel shipments to the Guardian. \"The packages looked very random - sex toys from China, vibrators, lubricants, cosmetics ... we thought it was pretty worthless shit,\" said Kirill, whose name has been changed to allow him to speak freely, and who is hiding from law enforcement in a third country, outside Europe and Russia. Kirill said an account they knew only as VWarrior would send the group lists of items to buy via Telegram, which they would then collect and pack into boxes. Kirill said the account would post from several different accounts, all with names that included the word \"warrior\". VWarrior usually tasked the group with delivering the boxes from one location to another across Poland and Lithuania, though on at least two occasions, he instructed them to send them via DHL, according to Kirill. All payments to the couriers were done in cryptocurrency. \"It could be true that the purpose of the parcels was sinister,\" Kirill admitted. \"We just wanted easy money, work that wouldn't involve drugs or weapons ... but it turned out to be some packages to test some fucked up shit,\" he said. Polish officials would later discover that at least one of the parcels sent by Bezrukavyi's group concealed a homemade incendiary device, hidden among the sex toys and reportedly crafted from a cocktail of chemicals, including highly reactive magnesium. Multinational race to find culprits Over the course of three days in July, European security agencies were shaken by three separate package explosions - each sent from Lithuania - that detonated in Birmingham, UK; Leipzig, Germany; and near Warsaw, Poland. Western security agencies were quick to suspect Russian intelligence was behind the incidents, which came amid a series of other hostile acts - including arson, cyber-attacks, data theft and the targeting of undersea cables. It was a fourth package - sent by another member of Bezrukavyi's network - that helped Polish authorities piece together what was happening. Dispatched from Vilnius on 18 July, the parcel was prepared by a Ukrainian national, Vladyslav Derkavets, and disguised as a shipment of cosmetics and sex toys. Unlike the others, the package failed to detonate at a depot in Warsaw, allowing investigators to recover it intact and analyse its contents. Reuters earlier reported that the devices were rigged to ignite using pre-set timers repurposed from inexpensive Chinese electronics typically used for tracking lost items. Their impact was intensified by tubes disguised as cosmetics, which were actually filled with a flammable gel containing compounds such as nitromethane. The Guardian obtained what a second source involved in the scheme described as a photograph of the alleged order before it was dispatched. The image - the first of its kind to be published - shows four massage pillows, along with several cosmetic tubes and sex toys, laid on a mattress. The source said the shipment was coordinated by the VWarrior account who paid for it via cryptocurrency, specifically the Tether crypto token, through a middleman. According to information seen by the Guardian, a cryptocurrency wallet said by a source to be linked to VWarrior transferred the equivalent of $960 (PS720) to another wallet in July as payment for the delivery. A screenshot of the VWarrior telegram account, no longer active, shows a person in tactical gear and helmet, face hidden. The Guardian was unable to reach VWarrior for comment. It remains unclear what role exactly Bezrukavyi and his associates played in the three parcel deliveries that caught fire. However, all the couriers appear to have operated within the same network and transported similar content of sex toys and massage pillow devices. As European officials set off on a multinational race to find the culprits behind the mysterious fires, Bezrukavyi's group continued their courier work, apparently under the instructions of VWarrior. On 1 August, Bezrukavyi, together with Chabanenko, strolled through a market on the outskirts of Warsaw. They picked out two pairs of Nike sneakers and six sets of sportswear, stuffing them into a plastic bag. VWarrior then instructed them to ship the goods to fictitious addresses in Washington and Ottawa via DHL. These shipments appear to have raised suspicion among Polish security services, who had already been on high alert after the string of explosions. Sending American-branded clothes back to North America - at steep transatlantic shipping costs - made little sense. Polish investigators soon concluded the packages with clothes did not contain explosives in contrast to the other shipments. Instead, the shipments, they believed, were a test - a dry run to probe international delivery routes and timing for future Russian operations to target North American-bound cargo. After receiving intelligence about the alleged plot, top officials in the Biden administration were shocked, and wondered whether the Kremlin was aware of the possible implications. \"It's unclear whether the Russian services were aware of the fact that a fairly large number of cargo traffic goes on passenger planes,\" said a former US security official, pointing out that the consequences of a mid-flight explosion could be catastrophic. Several top officials called their Russian counterparts and asked them to tell Putin to put a stop to the operation. \"I think the calls were successful,\" the former security official added. Arrests across Europe Four days after the trip to the Warsaw market, Polish police forces arrived at the flat shared by Bezrukavyi and Chabanenko in Warsaw, arresting the latter. \"From that moment on, they started picking up our friends one by one,\" said Kirill. Yevseyev, who together with Kirill had provided the car, fled to Spain where he was later apprehended and was handed over to Polish authorities. Derkavets, the Ukrainian who had sent the package that did not catch fire, was arrested in Poland. Kirill spoke to the Guardian from a third country, where he is hiding. A law enforcement source confirmed there was an Interpol red notice issued by Poland for Kirill for \"sabotage and espionage of a terrorism nature\". Bezrukavyi was out grocery shopping when the police came for him. His friends warned him about the raid, according to his wife, Natalia, and instead of returning home, he went on the run. He fled to Slovakia, where he spent the next few weeks hiding out in small villages. He decided to attempt to return to Russia, telling Natalia he would rather risk arrest at home than keep hiding in Europe. But on the way, while in Bosnia, Polish authorities caught his scent. Natalia painted the whole case as a huge misunderstanding. \"He is completely innocent. This is all a very bad dream,\" she said. Warsaw, however, considered Bezrukavyi important enough for the head of its domestic intelligence services to fly to Bosnia to discuss his extradition with his counterpart in the Balkan nation, according to a source with direct knowledge of the meeting. There are also indications that Russia valued Bezrukavyi. Shortly after his arrest in Bosnia, Russian officials initiated a parallel extradition request - citing a 2019 criminal case as the basis. Moscow frequently relies on old charges - or launches new ones - against its own citizens, including intelligence operatives and Kremlin-linked businessmen, to establish legal grounds for demanding them back. Bezrukavyi's background, in the criminal circles of Rostov region, does not contain any of the red flags previously present in staff GRU officers who travelled to direct operations in Europe. Western intelligence officials say that, hit by travel bans and western sanctions, Moscow now prefers to use freelancers on the ground. \"What we see recently is that staff officers of the Russian intelligence services rarely leave Russian territory, instead recruiting agents to do the work remotely, often via Telegram,\" said one European security official. These freelancers might know nothing about what they are doing, or they might be trusted coordinators, taking orders from contacts in the security services and recruiting others to run operations. Another western security official, who was briefed on the case, said they believed Bezrukavyi was knowingly working for the GRU, who directed the operation to send the clothing parcels. He recruited friends - many of them financially struggling and with criminal records - who may not have fully understood the true purpose behind the tasks they were given. Kirill told the Guardian he had never suspected the parcels could be linked to intelligence work. He admitted he could not be fully certain that his old friend Bezrukavyi was also in the dark about the true purpose of the packages. Perhaps he knew more than he let on. But even then, he said, he did not think his friend would have been acting from any sense of higher calling. \"I'm sure he didn't do it 'for the Motherland' - he just wanted easy money. He's been a criminal his whole life,\" said Kirill. One thing is certain, he added. If the Russian services continue their sabotage offensive, there are sure to be more arrests: \"There will be others who'll want to make some money, and someone will be there to take advantage of that.\" * Russia's spies: Uncovering Russia's secret espionage programmes.

      "ml_hf_summary": "In July 2024, a series of package explosions originating from Lithuania and targeting locations in Birmingham, Leipzig, and Warsaw raised suspicions of Russian involvement. Polish authorities identified Alexander Bezrukavyi, a Russian national with a history of criminal activity, as a key figure in the operation. Bezrukavyi, along with associates Vyacheslav Chabanenko and Serhiy Yevseyev, allegedly received instructions from an anonymous Telegram account named \"VWarrior,\" believed to be linked to Russia's GRU military intelligence agency. They transported packages containing camouflaged explosives disguised as everyday items like sex toys and massage pillows.  \n\nThe operation was disrupted when a package sent by another member of the network failed to detonate, allowing investigators to uncover the plot. Bezrukavyi fled to Bosnia but was apprehended in November 2024 and extradited to Poland in February 2025. The Biden administration intervened, urging Russia to halt the operation due to its potential for catastrophic consequences on passenger planes.  Bezrukavyi claims he was unaware of the true purpose of the packages, stating he was simply seeking easy money. However, Western intelligence officials believe Bezrukavyi knowingly participated in the GRU's sabotage campaign, which utilizes freelancers and recruits with criminal backgrounds to carry out operations remotely. \n\n\n"

      "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/05/luis-antonio-tagle-cardinal-philippines-catholic-karaoke-priest-pope",
      "published": "2025-05-05",
      "summary": "Tagle is considered progressive and humble, but has faced some criticism for his response to the drug war and sexual abuse in the church",
      "content": "Filipino Cardinal Luis Antonio Tagle laughed when asked in 2015 if he had ever considered that he might one day be pope. \"I make a public confession here. I cannot even manage my life. How can I imagine a worldwide community?\" Despite his self-deprecating response, the Filipino cardinal is among those tipped as a potential successor to Pope Francis. If appointed, he would be the first Asian pope in modern times. Tagle, who goes by the nickname \"Chito,\" has been described as the Asian Francis, due to his progressive outlook and humble lifestyle. He has previously criticised the \"harsh\" stance toward single mothers, and people who are gay or divorced. As bishop of Imus, a city near Manila, he rode jeepneys, cheap public minivans and invited the destitute to eat with him. Known as approachable and unpretentious, Tagle is also a fan of singing and dancing. Videos of him on Tiktok have been shared widely, winning him the approval of many in the Philippines, where karaoke is practically a national sport, and beyond. \"When he speaks and gives lectures he's not the usual, formal priest. He sings. He's a Filipino. He is a karaoke priest,\" said Michael Xiao Chua, a historian at De La Salle University. Tagle has an \"off the cuff\" style, and is like \"a rock star\" after mass, he added, saying he had seen volunteers circle around Tagle to manage queues of people wanting to greet him. Tagle, 67, was born in Imus, near the capital region Metro Manila, to Catholic parents who worked in a bank. \"He's [from] a very simple family - not poor but not rich,\" said Mary John Mananzan, a missionary benedictine sister who has known Tagle for decades. Tagle reportedly wanted to become a doctor, but entered the church after a priest tricked him into applying to a seminary in Quezon City. He obtained a doctorate at the Catholic University of America and became Bishop of Imus and, later, archbishop of Manila. He was made a cardinal by Pope Benedict XVI in 2012. But his rise to the top echelons of the Catholic church has not been without controversy. Tagle served as president of Caritas Internationalis from 2015 until 2022 when the leadership team was removed due to concerns over mismanagement. At the time Tagle - who was not involved in day-to-day operations - said the decision did not relate to allegations of sexual abuse or mismanagement of money. This March a survivors group, the Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests, called for an investigation into Tagle, and five other cardinals, in relation to the handling of alleged child abuses cases by Caritas Internationalis in New Zealand and the Central African Republic. Tagle has not commented on these calls. Campaigners have said Tagle has not worked hard enough to tackle sexual abuse in the church. Anne Barrett Doyle, co-director of BishopAccountability.org, said last week the church in the Philippines was in the \"dark ages\" on the issue, and that guidelines on dealing with allegations have not been published on the website of the Manila archdiocese or the Bishops' Conference of the Philippines. Questioning his suitability, she said: \"If Cardinal Tagle cannot even get his brother bishops from his home country to publish guidelines. What on earth can we expect for him to achieve as pope of a global church?\" However the Catholic Bishops Conference of the Philippines defended Tagle, stating that during his tenure as bishop of Imus and archbishop of Manila he had \"actively participated in the development and implementation\" of guidelines on handling sexual abuse cases but that he \"no longer holds direct authority over any diocese in the Philippines\". Tagle, it said, \"has consistently advocated for a humble and responsive Church that listens to the cries of the wounded and acts decisively to protect the vulnerable.\" In the Philippines, Tagle has also been accused of being slow to condemn former Philippine president Rodrigo Duterte's so-called war on drugs. As many as 30,000 people were killed in the crackdowns, which began after Duterte took office in June 2016. Many victims were young men, who were shot dead in the streets. In 2017, Tagle wrote a pastoral letter criticising the killings, saying: \"We cannot govern the nation by killing. We cannot foster a humane and decent Filipino culture by killing.\" However, some say he should have spoken out more clearly earlier. Duterte's war on drugs marked a difficult chapter for the Catholic church in the Philippines. Some priests risked retaliation by criticising the killings, and despite international outrage over the killings, Duterte remained highly popular among the Catholic-majority population. Mananzan said Tagle was not \"the condemning type\". \"He had very strong statements about the extrajudicial killings... But he never [talked] about Duterte as a person.\" Tagle opposed the passing of the Reproductive Health Bill in the Philippines, which offered free contraceptives and information on family planning. He also opposes abortion rights. Were Tagle to be appointed pope, it would be met by huge celebrations in the Philippines, where 80% of the population is Catholic. Despite a 500-year history with the Catholic church, the Philippines has always felt that it exists on the outskirts, said historian Xiao Chua. Pope Francis was the first non-European pope in centuries, he said, of a trend that should continue. \"We need [another] pope from the peripheries.\"",
      "ml_hf_summary": "Cardinal Luis Antonio Tagle, nicknamed \"Chito,\" is considered a potential successor to Pope Francis and would be the first Asian pope in modern times. Known for his progressive views and humble lifestyle, Tagle has criticized harsh stances towards single mothers, LGBTQ+ individuals, and divorced people. He gained popularity in the Philippines for his approachable demeanor, singing talent, and use of social media platforms like TikTok.  While Tagle's rise within the Catholic Church has been marked by both praise and controversy, including allegations of mismanagement during his presidency of Caritas Internationalis and criticism regarding his handling of sexual abuse cases, he remains a prominent figure in the Philippines where Catholicism is deeply ingrained. \n\n\n"

      "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/04/ultranationalist-wins-first-round-of-romanias-rerun-presidential-election",
      "published": "2025-05-05",
      "summary": "George Simion will face centrist Bucharest mayor Nicușor Dan in runoff vote",
      "content": "An ultranationalist who opposes military aid to Ukraine, has vilified the EU's leaders, and calls himself Donald Trump's \"natural ally\" has won the first round of Romania's rerun presidential vote and will face a centrist in the runoff, as vote counting nears its end. With 99% of votes counted late on Sunday, George Simion, whose far-right Alliance for the Union of Romanians (AUR) began as an anti-vax movement during the pandemic, was comfortably in the lead on a projected 40.5% of the vote. Far behind in second place was Bucharest Mayor Nicusor Dan with 20.89%, and in third place the governing coalition's joint candidate, Crin Antonescu, with 20.34%. He conceded defeat after midnight, saying he believes it's an \"irreversible result.\" Final results are not expected until early on Monday. The two highest-scoring candidates are scheduled to face each other in a second-round runoff on 18 May, nearly six months after the original ballot was cancelled amid evidence of an alleged \"massive\" Russian influence campaign. After the exit polls were published, Simion said: \"This is not just an electoral victory, it is a victory of Romanian dignity. It is the victory of those who have not lost hope, of those who still believe in Romania, a free, respected, sovereign country.\" Polls are not highly reliable in Romania but several have suggested Simion could beat Dan in a runoff, but would face a harder race against Antonescu, who has been out of politics for a decade but is a well-known figure. A far-right victory could lead to Romania - which shares a border with Ukraine and is a member of the EU and Nato - veering from its present pro-western path and becoming another disruptive force within the bloc and the transatlantic defence alliance. It would also be welcomed by conservative nationalists in Europe and beyond, including senior Trump administration figures such as the US vice-president, JD Vance, who accused Bucharest of denying democracy after the original ballot was cancelled. That vote was won by Calin Georgescu, a far-right, Moscow-friendly independent who declared zero campaign spending. It was annulled by Romania's top court after declassified intelligence documents revealed an alleged Russian influence operation. In February, Georgescu, who denies any wrongdoing, was placed under investigation on counts including misreporting campaign finances, misuse of digital technology and promoting fascist groups. In March, he was barred from standing in the rerun. Romania's president has a semi-executive role with considerable powers over foreign policy, national security, defence spending and judicial appointments. They also represent the country on the international stage and can veto important EU votes. Anti-establishment sentiment is running high in Romania, where median household income is one-third of the EU average. More than 30% of the country's 19 million people are at risk of poverty and social exclusion, and nearly 20% of the workforce is working abroad. Casting his ballot alongside Georgescu in Bucharest on Sunday, Simion, 38, said the pair had \"one mission only: the return to constitutional order, the return to democracy. I have no other goal than first place for the Romanian people.\" Georgescu, 63, called the vote rerun \"a fraud orchestrated by those who have made deceit the only state policy\", but said he was voting to \"acknowledge the power of democracy, the power of the vote that frightens the system, that terrifies the system\". Dan, a 55-year-old mathematician and former anti-corruption activist who founded the Save Romania Union party (USR), is running on an independent, pro-EU \"Honest Romania\" ticket. He said he voted \"for hope and a new beginning\" for Romania. Antonescu, 65, whose presidential run is backed by the ruling Social Democratic party (PSD) and the centre-right National Liberal party (PNL), said he was voting for \"a united Romania, for a strong Romania, for a dignified Romania\". Simion has described himself as \"more moderate\" than Georgescu but has repeatedly insisted on Romania's \"sovereignty\", and called for the country's pre-second world war borders to be restored by Moldova and Ukraine, from both of which he is banned. In contrast to Georgescu, Simion has frequently denounced Russia, while lashing out at Brussels and praising Trump's Republicans in the US. He has said he aims to set up an alliance of countries within the EU \"in the spirit of Maga\". He said on Sunday that he aimed to bring Georgescu into government if he won. \"There are several ways in which, if the Romanian people want, Mr Georgescu can be in our country's leadership, and we will use it,\" Simion said. \"We can form a majority and have him as a prime minister, we can have snap elections or call for a referendum.\" Romania held parliamentary elections in December, with Simion's AUR and other far-right groups winning 35% of seats. A snap election can be triggered if MPs reject two proposed governments within the space of 60 days. Experts have said this is unlikely since it has never happened before, and for the time being at least, the ruling centrist coalition appears united. If he is elected, Simion has said he would reveal \"how much we have contributed to the war effort in Ukraine, to the detriment of Romanian children and our elderly\". To date, Romania has donated a Patriot air defence battery to Kyiv, is training Ukrainian fighter pilots and has enabled the export of 30m tonnes of Ukrainian grain through its Black Sea port of Constanta since Russia's invasion.",
      "ml_hf_summary": "George Simion, leader of the far-right Alliance for the Union of Romanians (AUR), won the first round of Romania's rerun presidential election with an estimated 40.5% of the vote.  He will face Bucharest Mayor Nicusor Dan in a runoff on May 18th. The original ballot was annulled due to alleged Russian influence, and the previous winner, Călin Georgescu, is under investigation for campaign finance violations. Simion has expressed anti-EU sentiment, called for Romania's pre-World War II borders, and praised Donald Trump. A victory for Simion could shift Romania away from its pro-Western stance and towards a more nationalist direction.  \n\n\n"

Prague steers a European drive to supply artillery ammunition to Ukraine, financed largely by Nato allies. \"Not only North Korea is capable of helping [Russia] in the war - we have allies who are helping Ukraine,\" Zelenskyy said in comments reported by the Kyiv Independent. Zelenskyy added there would be a meeting on Monday with \"Czech defence companies\", with details to be announced later. Discussions were under way for a Ukrainian-Czech pilot training school for F16 fighter jets, which could not be established in Ukraine \"due to current security concerns\". Zelenskyy spoke alongside Petr Pavel, president of the Czech Republic and a former Nato general, who said that \"Putin can end the war with a single decision but he has not shown any willingness so far\". The Czech prime minister, Petr Fiala, and the speakers of both parliament chambers said they would meet Zelenskyy in Prague on Monday. Ukrainian forces struck an electrical equipment factory in Russia's Bryansk region close to the border with Ukraine, destroying much of the plant, said the local governor, Alexander Bogomaz. Ukraine said the factory specialised in the production of electronics for Russia's defence industry. \"According to preliminary information, the Strela factory in Suzemka, Bryansk region, is no longer operational following the strike,\" said Andriy Kovalenko, head of the government's Centre for Countering Disinformation. Mash, a Telegram channel with links to Russia's security services, said the factory produced electrical equipment and was hit by a Grad rocket system. Russian air defences destroyed four Ukrainian drones flying towards Moscow, the city's mayor said early on Monday. A total of 26 Ukrainian drones targeted Russian territory overnight, Russia's defence ministry said, including those aimed at Moscow as well as 17 over the Bryansk region and five over the Kaluga region. The aviation authority Rosaviatsia said it halted flights at Domodedovo airport, which serves Moscow, for about one and a half hours. Zelenskyy said on Sunday that he did not believe Putin would adhere to a self-declared three-day truce to coincide with Russia's \"victory day\" celebrations on 9 May. \"This is not the first challenge, nor are these the first promises made by Russia to cease fire. We understand who we are dealing with, we do not believe them.\" Citing a military report, he said Russia had carried out more than 200 attacks on Saturday, \"so there is no faith [in them]\". Zelenskyy said, though, that a ceasefire with Russia was possible at any moment and called on Kyiv's allies to apply greater pressure on Moscow otherwise Putin would take no real steps to end the war. The Guardian's Shaun Walker has investigated how Moscow is using \"disposable people\" recruited online to carry out sabotage, arson and disinformation campaigns in Europe - sometimes against specific targets related to support for the Ukrainian war effort, but more often simply to cause chaos and unease. While some know exactly what they are doing and why, others do not realise they are ultimately working for Moscow. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, said in comments broadcast on Sunday said that the need to use nuclear weapons in Ukraine had not arisen, and that he hoped it would not, writes Angelique Chrisafis. Putin said Russia could bring the conflict in Ukraine to what he called a \"logical conclusion ... There has been no need to use those [nuclear] weapons ... and I hope they will not be required.\"",

And one of its top customers, no less. \n India, a big buyer of Chinese solar panels and electric vehicle batteries, is using a raft of government incentives to make more green gear at home. It is driven not just by the need to satisfy the galloping energy demands of its 1.4 billion people, but also to cash in on other countries that want to China-proof their energy supply chains, not least the United States. \n India remains a tiny and tardy entrant. Last year it produced around 80 gigawatts of solar modules, while China produced more than 10 times that. India is still tied to coal, the dirtiest fossil fuel: Coal is its largest source of electricity, and India plans to mine for more of it. \n But India is aggressively trying to take advantage of a global energy transition and a backlash against Chinese dominance of new energy technologies. \n Hoping to spur a clean energy manufacturing boom, the government is offering lucrative subsidies for locally produced solar cells and batteries, and it is restricting foreign products in its biggest renewable-energy projects. To cash in on government contracts to install rooftop solar for 27 million households by the end of this decade, for instance, companies must make the panels at home. \n For New Delhi, there are social, economic and geopolitical imperatives. China is its most formidable rival -- the two countries have in the past gone to war over border disputes -- so India's quest to build solar, wind and electric vehicle factories is partly designed to secure its energy supply chain. At the same time India wants to create good-paying manufacturing jobs. \n Still, India confronts a dilemma facing many other countries: Either buy renewable energy technologies as cheaply as possible from China, or spend more to make the goods at home. \n \"Strategically, to ensure we have energy independence, we need to have manufacturing capacity,\" said Sudeep Jain, additional secretary in India's Ministry of New and Renewable Energy. \"Currently, yes, there is a cost arbitrage.\"",

      "content": "Eighty years after the second world war, polling shows many Americans and western Europeans believe an even more devastating third global conflict could break out within a decade, with tensions with Russia seen as the most probable cause. As Europe prepares to mark the 80th anniversary of VE Day, the YouGov polling also showed large majorities felt that events during and before the second world war were relevant today and must continue to be taught to younger generations. Between 41% and 55% of respondents in the five European countries polled: Britain, France, Germany, Italy and Spain, said they thought another world war was very or fairly likely within the next five to 10 years, a view shared by 45% of Americans. Majorities of 68% to 76% said they expected any new conflict would involve nuclear weapons, and between 57% and 73% also said a third world war would lead to greater loss of life than in 1939-1945. Many (25% to 44%) believed it would kill most people in the world. Most people, ranging from 66% in Italy to 89% in the UK, said they would expect their country to be involved in such a war - but only minorities, from 16% in Italy to 44% in France, thought their armed forces would be able to defend them. In contrast, 71% of Americans said they had confidence in the US military. Russia was seen as the most probable cause of another world war by between 72% and 82% of western Europeans and 69% of Americans, followed by Islamic terrorism. Many Europeans, however, also felt the same about Europe's supposed ally the US, with majorities in Spain (58%), Germany (55%) and France (53%) seeing tensions with the US as a major or moderate threat to continental peace. Looking back to the second world war, respondents in France (72%), Germany (70%) and the UK (66%) were the most likely to say they knew a great deal or a fair amount about the conflict, with those in Spain - which was not involved - the least (40%). About 77% of French people said they had been taught a great deal or fair amount about the war in school, compared with 60% of Germans, 48% of Britons and only 34% of Spaniards. Younger generations were more likely to report having been taught a lot. Overwhelming majorities (82% to 90%) of western Europeans and Americans, however, said they thought it was important the second world war be taught in schools, with between 72% and 87% saying the events of the conflict and those leading up to it were still relevant today. Between 31% (Spain) and 52% (the US) across all six countries said they thought it was possible that \"crimes like those committed by the Nazi regime in Germany in the 1930s and 40s\" could happen in their own country, during their lifetimes. More respondents (44% to 59%) said they thought Nazi-style crimes could be committed in \"another western European country\", with 44% to 60% also saying such a scenario was possible in the US - including 52% of Americans. Asked who had done the most to defeat the Nazis, 40% to 52% in five countries surveyed replied the US, and 17% to 28% the Soviet Union. In the UK, however, 41% of respondents answered Britain - a view shared by only 5% to 11% of Americans and other western Europeans. Almost half of Germans (46%) said they believed their country had done a good job since 1945 of dealing with its wartime actions, a view 49% of Americans and 58% of Britons agreed with. Respondents in France (34%) and Italy (30%) were not so sure. However, almost half of Germans (47%) said they also thought their country had been \"overly conscious of its Nazi past\", preventing it from acting strongly enough on more recent problems. Only 24% thought their leaders had got the balance right. When it came to who had done the most to preserve peace since the end of the war, majorities (52% to 66%) in all six countries answered Nato, with at least a plurality (44% to 60%) crediting the United Nations with contributing a \"great deal\" or \"fair amount\". Between 45% and 56% of western Europeans and Americans also believed the EU - established partly with the goal of maintaining peace in Europe - had been a significant contributor to the absence of conflict.",

      "summary": "Military armistice ending second world war was signed in this nondescript Reims schoolhouse before VE Day",
      "content": "For a building that witnessed one of the pivotal moments of European history, it is oddly unremarkable: a nondescript red-brick schoolhouse on an unexceptional street on the wrong side of the railway tracks in Reims, eastern France. In May 1945 it was the College Moderne et Technique. Students came and went. Passersby may have wondered, briefly, at the two US military police officers outside the doors, but Americans were everywhere - the city had been liberated in August 1944. Up on the first floor, however, in a commandeered classroom, Gen Dwight D Eisenhower and his staff were coordinating the final assault on Nazi Germany from what was then the Supreme Headquarters of the Allied Expeditionary Force. It was, as the Baltimore Sun correspondent Price Day said, \"the most secret of secret places in Europe\". And it was here, as neat black lettering on the facade now notes, \"that on 7 May 1945 was signed the act that ended the second world war in Europe\". This Victory in Europe (VE) Day, the 80th, carries more weight than usual. Few of those who attend it are likely to mark the next major anniversary in 2035, and it comes at a time when peace and security on the continent have rarely felt more fragile. In the small museum that Eisenhower's headquarters has now become, the present mayor of Reims confessed to just one minor regret. \"France never appropriated that date of 7 May,\" said Arnaud Robinet. \"There were reasons, but it's a shame. The date chosen for Victory in Europe Day was 8 May. Yet the Germans surrendered here, in the next room, on the seventh. It's been a bit forgotten.\" Reims has always marked 7 May. This year, its ceremony will be televised, a day before national commemorations in Paris. The 80th anniversary was vital, Robinet said: \"We're at a turning point. A moment where memory and history separate.\" To mark it here, the eternal flame is being brought from the Arc de Triomphe. Besides the official ceremonies there will be talks and documentaries, a specially written play, a son et lumiere display, period vehicles, concerts and a bal populaire. Through five days of events, the focus will be on transmission to the next generation. \"Because events elsewhere show us the peace in Europe that was made here is not guaranteed,\" he said. \"If you don't know your history, you can't prepare the future.\" Next door at the Lycee Roosevelt, as the technical college is now known, Sven Turpin-Mihailovic, 18, agreed. \"You feel the huge weight of history - of the most devastating war in history - heavily here,\" he said. \"Yet the same mistakes are being made.\" Turpin-Mihailovic and two final-year classmates, Julie Le Bailly, 18, and Doriane Koutcheroff, 17, are among five students preparing a guided tour of the building for VIPs attending next week's commemorations. What happened in the schoolhouse was part of their upbringing, they said. \"My mum used to bring me here all the time,\" said Koutcheroff. \"It's incredibly important today that this history is transmitted. We can't forget.\" Le Bailly said the schoolhouse, and the commemorative events it will host, stood for \"memory, for peace, and for the courage of those who fought. They're a homage to all of that. And a warning not to commit the mistakes of the past.\" Turpin-Mihailovic said the students felt \"like the guarantors of this history, this memory. The ones who will carry it forward. Our generation saw the return of war in Europe. Here, you can almost smell what that felt like, 80 years ago. We mustn't let go of that.\" If history records that the allied victory came on 8 May 1945, it is mainly because of Joseph Stalin, who decided he wanted a far statelier, more symbolic capitulation in Berlin, where Germany's aggression began, and which was now in Soviet hands. The Reims surrender was a purely military affair, and relatively low-key. Grand Admiral Karl Donitz, Adolf Hitler's successor after the Fuhrer's suicide on 30 April 1945, had wanted separate ceasefires so as to continue fighting the Red Army in the east. Eisenhower, however, refused, and on the afternoon of 6 May, Gen Alfred Jodl, chief of the German armed forces operations staff, was sent to Reims with authority to sign a full and unconditional surrender of land, air and seaborne forces. Final negotiations dragged on deep into the night, with the German delegation pressing in particular for a delay to the ceasefire to enable as many soldiers and civilians as possible to flee west and avoid falling into the hands of the Red Army. It was not until 2.41 on the morning of 7 May that the document was finally signed at the long table in the brightly lit war room, its walls hung with huge charts of battlefield and air operations, railways, supply depots and prisoners taken. Eisenhower's chief of staff, Gen Walter Bedell Smith, signed for the western allies, followed by Gen Ivan Susloparov for the Soviet forces, and Jodl for Germany. Maj Gen Francois Sevez, representing France, signed as a witness, since the surrender was on French soil. Seventeen members of the press had been bussed in from Paris for the occasion. \"The scene seemed to freeze,\" the Associated Press correspondent Relman Morin, who died in 1973, would write later. \"It had the character of a picture, somehow, a queer unreality. Here was the end of nearly five years of war, of blood and death, of explosions and bullets whining and the wailing of air raid sirens. Here, brought into this room, was the end of all that.\" With Jodl's signature on the act of surrender, Morin said, he was \"signing away the German army, and the Luftwaffe, and the submarines\". With one scratch of the general's pen, \"the state that was to have lasted a thousand years, died.\" Because Eisenhower outranked Jodl, he was not present for the signing, but he received the German delegation in his office upstairs. Minutes later, he dispatched a simple message: \"The mission of this allied force was fulfilled at 0241, local time, May 7th, 1945.\" There were no immediate celebrations. The ceasefire was set for 11.01pm on 8 May, and the correspondents present were sworn not to report the surrender until further notice. A few hours later, however, German radio did - and the news was out. \"Nazis Quit!\" was the banner headline in a late-night extra edition of the Cleveland News on 7 May, with variations on the same theme in every other US paper. \"The greatest war in history ended today with the unconditional surrender of Germany.\" The western allies' leaders - the US president, Harry S Truman, the British prime minister, Winston Churchill, and the head of the Free French, Gen Charles de Gaulle - announced the end of the war the next afternoon. It was not quite over yet, though. \"Stalin refused to acknowledge the surrender and said Susloparov was not authorised to sign it,\" said Benedicte Hernu, the director of Reims's historical museums. \"He insisted on another, grander surrender in Berlin that would highlight the Soviet role.\" De Gaulle fully backed the idea, Hernu said, since he believed the Free French \"had been short-changed by the Americans, too\". The other allies did not object, so Reims became \"the military surrender, and Berlin the political, diplomatic one\". The text - containing hardly any significant changes, but agreed this time by three marshals: Georgy Zhukov, Arthur Tedder and Wilhelm Keitel - was signed at 10.43pm CET. At 11.01pm, as dictated in the Reims capitulation, the fighting in Europe ended. The Museum of the Surrender in Reims, where the war room has been preserved almost exactly as it was on 7 May 1945 - bar a few missing ashtrays, spirited away on the night as souvenirs - closes for renovation after the 80th VE Day events. \"We're modernising it, focusing on explaining what happened here and why, and what is left now,\" Hernu said. \"It's about educating and transmitting. No one would have thought, even a few years ago, we'd be asking the same questions as then.\"",

      "summary": "The draft bill is modelled on Australian laws and would force digital platforms to verify the age of users or face heavy fines",
      "content": "New Zealand's prime minister has proposed banning children under 16 years old from using social media, in an effort to protect young people from harms such as exposure to violent content and cyberbullying. Christopher Luxonsaid on Tuesday the draft law would force social media companies to verify users were at least 16 before allowing them to create an account, or face fines of up to NZ$2m ($1.2m). While good things could come from social media, it was not always a safe place for young people and the onus was on tech companies to be socially responsible, Luxon said. \"This is about protecting our children. It's about making sure social media companies are playing their role in keeping our kids safe,\" Luxon said. Teachers and parents had raised issues with him including cyberbullying, exposure to violent and inappropriate content, exploitation and social media addiction. \"Parents are constantly telling us that they are really worried about the impact that social media is having on their children,\" Luxon said. \"And they say they are really struggling to manage access to social media.\" The author of the bill, National MP Catherine Wedd, said there are no legally enforceable age verification measures for social media platforms in New Zealand and her bill would better support families to have oversight of their children's online use. The proposed ban is closely modelled on that of Australia, which sits at the forefront of global efforts to regulate social media. Australia passed landmark laws in November banning under-16s from social media - one of the world's toughest crackdowns on popular sites such as Facebook, Instagram and X. The move sparked a fierce backlash from big tech companies who variously described the laws as \"rushed\", \"vague\" and \"problematic\". In December, a 1News Verian poll found more than two-thirds of New Zealanders supported restricting social media access for under-16s. The New Zealand bill was drafted by Luxon's centre-right National party, the biggest member of the three-way governing coalition and would need the support of Luxon's two coalition partners to pass. It is not yet clear when the bill will be introduced to parliament, but Luxon hoped the it would generate bipartisan support. \"It's not a political issue, it's a New Zealand issue,\" he said. Opposition Labour leader Chris Hipkins told Radio New Zealand he was open to the idea. \"This is a conversation we need to have as a country. The Australians have been courageous and tackled it. I think New Zealand needs to do the same.\"",

      "summary": "Ukrainian forces reportedly smash back across border into Kursk, where Syrski says offensive has achieved most of its goals. What we know on day 1,168",
      "content": "Ukraine has launched drones at Moscow for the second night in a row, forcing closure of the capital's three major airports, Russian officials said early on Wednesday. The mayor, Sergei Sobyanin, said 19 Ukrainian drones approached Moscow and what he claimed was debris from an intercepted drone fell over one of the key highways leading into the city. An apartment building was also reportedly struck. Russia's aviation authority, Rosaviatsia, said it halted flights at airports serving Moscow including Vnukovo, Domodedovo and Zhukovsky. Ukrainian forces attacked a power substation at the town of Rylsk in Russia's western Kursk region, the regional governor said early on Tuesday, after Russian war bloggers reported Ukrainian forces firing missiles had smashed through the border in Kursk, crossing minefields with armoured vehicles. The Kursk governor, Alexander Khinshtein, said two people were injured in the substation attack, while two transformers were damaged and power cut. The Russian military blog Rybar said Ukrainian units were trying to advance in Kursk near the settlements of Tyotkino and Glushkovo. The Ukrainian military said its forces had struck a Russian drone command unit near Tyotkino on Sunday. Russia said Ukrainian attacks on its border area near the Sumy region killed three people. Ukrainian prosecutors said on Monday that Russian forces had subjected two settlements in the Sumy region bordering Kursk - Bilopillya and Vorozhba - to artillery fire and guided bomb attacks, killing three residents and injuring four. Local officials ordered evacuations in part of Sumy across from the fighting in Kursk. The Ukrainian commander-in-chief, Gen Oleksandr Syrsky, said on Monday that the Kursk offensive had \"achieved most of its goals\", showing Ukraine's military capabilities and preventing Russia from launching offensives elsewhere on the frontline. In recent weeks, Russia claimed to have quashed Ukraine's Kursk incursion, but Ukraine's president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, says Kyiv's forces continue to operate there and in the adjacent Russian region of Belgorod. A Czech-led ammunition initiative has supplied Ukraine with half a million large-calibre rounds already since the start of the year, the Czech Republic's prime minister, Petr Fiala, said on Monday after meeting Zelenskyy in Prague. A Russian reporter critical of Moscow's invasion of Ukraine has fled to France and told how Reporters Without Borders helped coordinate her escape. Speaking in an interview with Agence France-Presse in Paris, Ekaterina Barabash, 64, said: \"Russian prison, it's not a life. It is worse than death.\" Barabash was arrested in February on allegations of spreading \"false information\" about the Russian armed forces in several posts she made on social media. She fled house arrest in April and made a \"very difficult\" journey to France taking about two and a half weeks. She removed her electronic bracelet when she fled house arrest - \"it's somewhere in the Russian forest.\"",

      "published": "2025-05-05",
      "summary": "Government response comes amid outrage over the murder of the men who had been held captive for more than a week",
      "content": "Peru's president, Dina Boluarte, has suspended gold mining and announced a 12-hour curfew in Pataz, in the northern region, after criminals kidnapped and killed 13 gold mine workers. A Peruvian gold mining company La Poderosa said on Sunday that the bodies of 13 contract workers from a local firm had been found by police inside one of the mine's tunnels. Boluarte told journalists on Monday that the \"armed forces will take control of the area where La Poderosa operates\", but did not give further details about how the 30-day mining pause would be enforced. The government response, which critics have called tardy and ineffective, comes amid outrage over the murder of the 13 men who had been held captive for more than a week by criminals believed linked to illegal mining. Police said the hostages were tortured and that video footage - allegedly recorded by the captors themselves - showed the miners were shot dead at point-blank range. Illegal gold mining has surged in Peru, Latin America's biggest producer of the precious metal, just as the international price peaked once more at around $3,500 per ounce. Meanwhile a crime wave has swept the country with unprecedented rises in racketeering and killing-for-hire. 2024 saw a record increase murder rates - a 35.9% increase in homicides compared with 2023. \"Illegal mining is the most lucrative criminal activity in the country,\" said Cesar Ipenza, an environmental lawyer. Illegal gold mining accounted for $9bn , or 60% of Peru's total laundered assets between January 2014 and October 2024, according to the country's Financial Intelligence Unit, dwarfing the next biggest sources of laundered assets. Once confined to certain zones illegal gold mining has spread throughout the country since the Covid-19 pandemic. The gold-rich area where the mine is located in La Libertad region has been under a state of emergency for more than two years due to ongoing violence and unrest. This massacre brings to 39 the number of artisanal miners and workers killed by criminal gangs in Pataz, the company La Poderosa Mining confirmed in a statement. \"The spiral of uncontrolled violence in Pataz is occurring despite the declaration of a state of emergency and the presence of a large police contingent which, unfortunately, has not been able to halt the deterioration of security conditions in the area,\" the statement added. In December, thousands of gold miners camped out in the downtown Lima and blocked the main highway to insist that the government maintain a registry of informal and illegal miners known as REINFO which protects them from prosecution.",

The prime minister's critics -- both inside and outside the country -- have urged him to bring to an end a conflict that began when Hamas killed about 1,200 people in Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, and took some 250 hostage. \n Israeli officials said the offensive would start slowly in anticipation of cease-fire negotiations that are ongoing ahead of President Trump's trip next week to the region for meetings in several Arab capitals. But the officials said that if a deal is not reached soon, the expanded ground operation would commence in earnest. \n Mr. Netanyahu vowed in the video that the decision to ramp up the fighting in Gaza does not mean Israel has abandoned hope for rescuing the remaining hostages. \n \"We will not give up on anyone,\" he vowed. \n David Mencer, a government spokesman, described the plan as a renewed effort to increase pressure on Hamas to release the hostages and to destroy all of Hamas's infrastructure, both above and below ground. He said the campaign calls for the \"holding of territories\" by Israeli soldiers for an indefinite period of time \"to prevent Hamas from taking it back.\" \n Mr. Mencer said the intent was not a permanent occupation of Gaza, a scenario that would almost certainly spur international objections, as would the forced relocation of Palestinians from their homes in the north.",

Those included vows to pull back American troops in Europe and a speech by Vice President JD Vance in Munich in which he attacked Europeans on \"free speech\" and warned them to stop sidelining parties like the AfD. \n Mr. Merz was also stunned by the dressing-down that Mr. Trump and Mr. Vance gave Volodymyr Zelensky, the Ukrainian president and a fellow ally, in the Oval Office. \"In my opinion, this was not a spontaneous reaction to Zelensky's statements, but rather an intentional escalation of tensions during the meeting in the Oval Office,\" Mr. Merz said at the time. \n Mr. Merz has increasingly pushed back against the Trump administration, warning Germans they must take responsibility for their own security. \"Do you seriously believe that an American government will agree to continue NATO as before?\" he asked lawmakers in March. \n Even many of those who have criticized Mr. Merz's leadership style have approved of his stance toward the United States. \n \"I believe that he truly understands how the global situation has changed and what is changing in the U.S.,\" said Mr. Polenz, the former secretary general of Mr. Merz's party. \"He is a staunch supporter of trans-Atlantic relations and will certainly try to maintain and stabilize all relations between Germany, Europe and the U.S. as best he can. But he is under no illusions about the difficulty of the task ahead.\" \n Tatiana Firsova contributed reporting from Berlin.",

It directed agencies to stop all permits for wind farms pending federal review. \n The lawsuit says that, by complying, federal agencies have put major investments that have already been made at risk.

Eric Trump, the president's middle son, runs the Trump Organization, the main family business, which specializes in real estate. He also serves on the board of a holding company that oversees World Liberty Financial, the family's crypto firm, and recently joined forces with his older brother, Donald Trump Jr., to start a Bitcoin mining operation, American Bitcoin. \n The White House has said there are no ethics issues because Mr. Trump's sons run the businesses. \"The president's assets are in a trust managed by his children,\" Anna Kelly, a White House spokeswoman, said. \"There are no conflicts of interest.\" \n But Mr. Trump's financial disclosure report, which he is legally required to file, shows that he still personally benefits financially from most of these ventures.",

      "content": "China, the world's clean-energy juggernaut, faces a rival right next door. And one of its top customers, no less. \n India, a big buyer of Chinese solar panels and electric vehicle batteries, is using a raft of government incentives to make more green gear at home. It is driven not just by the need to satisfy the galloping energy demands of its 1.4 billion people, but also to cash in on other countries that want to China-proof their energy supply chains, not least the United States. \n India remains a tiny and tardy entrant. Last year it produced around 80 gigawatts of solar modules, while China produced more than 10 times that. India is still tied to coal, the dirtiest fossil fuel: Coal is its largest source of electricity, and India plans to mine for more of it. \n But India is aggressively trying to take advantage of a global energy transition and a backlash against Chinese dominance of new energy technologies. \n Hoping to spur a clean energy manufacturing boom, the government is offering lucrative subsidies for locally produced solar cells and batteries, and it is restricting foreign products in its biggest renewable-energy projects. To cash in on government contracts to install rooftop solar for 27 million households by the end of this decade, for instance, companies must make the panels at home. \n For New Delhi, there are social, economic and geopolitical imperatives. China is its most formidable rival -- the two countries have in the past gone to war over border disputes -- so India's quest to build solar, wind and electric vehicle factories is partly designed to secure its energy supply chain. At the same time India wants to create good-paying manufacturing jobs. \n Still, India confronts a dilemma facing many other countries: Either buy renewable energy technologies as cheaply as possible from China, or spend more to make the goods at home. \n \"Strategically, to ensure we have energy independence, we need to have manufacturing capacity,\" said Sudeep Jain, additional secretary in India's Ministry of New and Renewable Energy. \"Currently, yes, there is a cost arbitrage.\"",

He invited lay people to sit with bishops to discuss controversial issues in Vatican meetings called synods. \n He was opposed by more conservative leaders, who may be keen to return to centralized decision making. \"I think the conversation will have to go along the lines of, 'Can we get away with doing away with it?'\" said Miriam Duignan, the executive director of the Wijngaards Institute for Catholic Research in Cambridge, England. \n Another key split is between those who believe the church should welcome everyone -- including those whose lives don't match traditional church teachings -- and those who think that only those committed to unwavering Catholic doctrine should be admitted into the church's fold.",

      "content": "The walls surrounding Ghana's national cathedral are aging plywood. Its spires are yellow construction cranes, which have not moved in years. It frequently reverberates with singing -- the singing of a choir of frogs that moves in whenever the cathedral's half-finished foundations fill with rainwater. \n Ghana's former president, Nana Akufo-Addo, spent around $58 million of public money on the $400 million cathedral project -- a huge sum in this debt-saddled West African country. The new finance minister said in March that Ghana's economy was in \"severe distress.\" \n The cathedral was designed by the celebrity architect David Adjaye. But beyond the blueprints, there is very little to show for the money. \n \"They have only dug a hole -- a big hole,\" Praise Chinedu, a student and a Pentecostal Christian, said last month.",
