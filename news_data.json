      "content": "Aurelio Costarella, one of the greats of Australian fashion, has died aged 60 after a short but stoic battle with a rare brain disease.\nAurelio had recently been diagnosed with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, a cruel incurable condition that also took the life of his sister Gracie.\nThe son of Italian migrants beloved as a gentle and generous genius in a cut-throat industry, Costarella dressed a generation of school prom princesses and even a real-life one in then Princess Mary of Denmark.\nHis dramatic and inimitable designs were also worn by the likes of Barbadian performer Rihanna, burlesque diva Dita Von Teese, our own Dannii Minogue, Sigrid Thornton and Julia Gillard, and international superstars Charlize Theron and Tyra Banks.\nIn the '90s, the self-taught designer's Ray Costarella Designs, with stores in Sydney's Strand Arcade and Claremont, was a success story unprecedented in WA.\nBut that business would end in acrimony, forcing the disenchanted designer to rethink his future and consider becoming a naturopath.\nHowever he would relaunch spectacularly in 2000 at Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week in Sydney, proudly attaching his proper birth name to a brand that became a tentpole attraction at Myer and David Jones.\nAurelio Costarella the brand was always key part of both department stores' extravagant season launches, and Aurelio Costarella the man was always an oasis of humility, authenticity and grace in a room bursting with bluff and bravado.\nIt was at that 2000 Fashion Week that Costarella experienced a defining moment, meeting Cate Blanchett backstage.\n\"I have such vivid memories of that,\" a tearful Aurelio told The West Australian at the time.\n\"Cate was the guest editor of Harper's Bazaar and she named my show as one of the highlights of the week. I thought well, this is the universe telling that I wasn't meant to be a naturopath.\"\nIn 2006, Aurelio Costarella became the first WA label to show at New York Fashion Week.\nFor years he operated a fantastical boutique and design house in the old post office in North Perth, down the road from his former primary school.\nAnd in 2015 he became one of the first retailers to start trading in the State Buildings.\nThroughout his career, barely a week would go by without a fabulous Aurelio Costarella frock featuring in the social pages.\nHowever in 2017 he closed the brand while navigating a struggle with depression and the headwinds of a halting retail economy.\nAt the time he reflected on \"so many magical moments\".\n\"Showing in New York for four seasons . . . selling to some of the most prestigious stores in the world, Barneys, Harvey Nichols, Henri Bendel, Villa Moda and celebrating 30 Years of Aurelio Costarella with a Retrospective at the WA Museum.\"\n\"Having Cate Blanchett name my Australian Fashion Week show as the highlight of the week when I relaunched as Aurelio Costarella in 2000 and then having Marion Hume cite my show as stand-out of the week in 2005 was amazing.\n\"And dressing the likes of Rihanna, Charlize Theron, Dita Von Teese and Princess Mary of Denmark (to name a few). The ultimate accolade for me was to be inducted into the Design Institute of Australia hall of Fame in 2016.\n\"This nod from the design fraternity almost made it OK for me to bow out.\"\nHowever, Aurelio said one of his proudest achievements was sharing his personal experience with depression and anxiety in a story in The West Australian in 2015.\nHe said at the time: \"I know from the daily messages I still receive that by sharing my story I have touched the lives of thousands of people.\n\"People still stop me in the streets to thank me and comment on how the story resonated with them.\"\nHe would commit to mental health advocacy work, raising awareness and campaigning for change through his role as an ambassador for Lifeline.\nAurelio would later channel his creative streak into painting, magical works which were turned into prints and wallpaper murals.\nIn 2024 the short film Becoming Aurelio, directed by Chantel Concei and produced by Kate Downie, premiered as part of the Revelation International Film Festival.\nAurelio spent his last weeks in hospital, where a pinboard was laden with images from his stunning career and messages of love from people who could barely comprehend the sudden decline of their wildly talented friend.\nHis swansong runway show was the wedding of his niece Olivia Costarella, whose gown he designed.\nIn his final days, Aurelio was surrounded by loved ones including his brother Tony and his longtime friend and business partner Paul O'Connor.\nLifeline 13 11 14\nSign up for our emails\nFind out More\n(c) West Australian Newspapers Limited 2025",

      "content": "A team of scientists claim to have discovered a new colour that no human has ever seen before. \nThe research follows an experiment in which researchers in the US had laser pulses fired into their eyes. \nBy stimulating specific cells in the retina, the participants claim to have witnessed a blue-green colour that scientists have called \"olo\", but some experts have said the existence of a new colour is \"open to argument\". \nThe findings, published in the journal Science Advances on Friday, have been described by the study's co-author, Prof Ren Ng from the University of California, as \"remarkable\". \nHe and his colleagues believe that the results could potentially further research into colour blindness. \nProf Ng, who was one of five people to take part in the experiment, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Saturday that olo was \"more saturated than any colour that you can see in the real world\". \n\"Let's say you go around your whole life and you see only pink, baby pink, a pastel pink,\" he said. \n\"And then one day you go to the office and someone's wearing a shirt, and it's the most intense baby pink you've ever seen, and they say it's a new colour and we call it red.\"\nDuring the team's experiment, researchers shined a laser beam into the pupil of one eye of each participant. \nThere were five participants in the study - four male and one female - who all had normal colour vision. Three of the participants - including Prof Ng - were co-authors of the research paper.\nAccording to the research paper, the participants looked into a device called Oz which consists of mirrors, lasers and optical devices. The equipment was designed previously by some of the involved researchers - a team of scientists from UC Berkeley and the University of Washington, and updated for use in this study.\nThe retina is a light-sensitive layer of tissue at the back of the eye responsible for receiving and processing visual information. It converts light into electrical signals, which are then transmitted to the brain via the optic nerve, enabling us to see.\nThe retina includes cone cells, which are cells responsible for perceiving colour. \nThere are three types of cone cells in the eye - S, L and M - and each one is sensitive to different wavelengths of blue, red and green respectively.\nAccording to the research paper, in normal vision, \"any light that stimulates an M cone cell must also stimulate its neighbouring L and/or S cones\", because its function overlaps with them. \nHowever, in the study, the laser only stimulated M cones, \"which in principle would send a colour signal to the brain that never occurs in natural vision\", the paper said. \nThis means the colour olo could not been seen by a person's naked eye in the real world without the help of specific stimulation. \nTo verify the colour observed during the experiment, each participant adjusted a controllable colour dial until it matched olo. \nSome experts, however, say the new perceived colour is a \"matter of interpretation\". \nProf John Barbur, a vision scientist at City St George's, University of London, who was not involved in the study, said that while the research is a \"technological feat\" in stimulating selective cone cells, the discovery of a new colour is \"open to argument\".\nHe explained that if, for example, the red cone cells (L) were stimulated in large numbers, people would \"perceive a deep red\", but the perceived brightness may change depending on changes to red cone sensitivity, which is not unlike what happened in this study.\nBut the study's co-author Prof Ng admitted that although olo is \"certainly very technically difficult\" to see, the team is studying the findings to see what it could potentially mean for colour blind people, who find it difficult to distinguish between certain colours.\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

      "content": "Contested discovery achieved by experiment firing laser pulses into eyes, stimulating retina cells\nAfter walking the Earth for a few hundred thousand years, humans might think they have seen it all. But not according to a team of scientists who claim to have experienced a colour no one has seen before.\nThe bold - and contested - assertion follows an experiment in which researchers in the US had laser pulses fired into their eyes. By stimulating individual cells in the retina, the laser pushed their perception beyond its natural limits, they say.\nTheir description of the colour is not too arresting - the five people who have seen it call it blue-green - but that, they say, does not fully capture the richness of the experience.\n\"We predicted from the beginning that it would look like an unprecedented colour signal but we didn't know what the brain would do with it,\" said Ren Ng, an electrical engineer at the University of California, Berkeley. \"It was jaw-dropping. It's incredibly saturated.\"\nThe researchers shared an image of a turquoise square to give a sense of the colour, which they named olo, but stressed that the hue could only be experienced through laser manipulation of the retina.\n\"There is no way to convey that colour in an article or on a monitor,\" said Austin Roorda, a vision scientist on the team. \"The whole point is that this is not the colour we see, it's just not. The colour we see is a version of it, but it absolutely pales by comparison with the experience of olo.\"\nHumans perceive the colours of the world when light falls on colour-sensitive cells called cones in the retina. There are three types of cones that are sensitive to long (L), medium (M) and short (S) wavelengths of light.\nNatural light is a blend of multiple wavelengths that stimulate L, M and S cones to different extents. The variations are perceived as different colours. Red light primarily stimulates L cones, while blue light chiefly activates S cones. But M cones sit in the middle and there is no natural light that excites these alone.\nThe Berkeley team set out to overcome the limitation. They began by mapping a small part of a person's retina to pinpoint the positions of their M cones. A laser is then used to scan the retina. When it comes to an M cone, after adjusting for movement of the eye, it fires a tiny pulse of light to stimulate the cell, before moving on to the next cone.\nThe result, published in Science Advances, is a patch of colour in the field of vision about twice the size of a full moon. The colour is beyond the natural range of the naked eye because the M cones are stimulated almost exclusively, a state natural light cannot achieve. The name olo comes from the binary 010, indicating that of the L, M and S cones, only the M cones are switched on.\nThe claim left one expert bemused. \"It is not a new colour,\" said John Barbur, a vision scientist at City St George's, University of London. \"It's a more saturated green that can only be produced in a subject with normal red-green chromatic mechanism when the only input comes from M cones.\" The work, he said, had \"limited value\".\nThe researchers believe the tool, named Oz vision after the Emerald City in the L Frank Baum books, will help them probe basic science questions about how the brain creates visual perceptions of the world. But it may have other applications. Through bespoke stimulation of cells in the retina, researchers might learn more about colour blindness or diseases that affect vision such as retinitis pigmentosa.\nWill the rest of the world get the chance to experience olo for themselves? \"This is basic science,\" said Ng. \"We're not going to see olo on any smartphone displays or any TVs any time soon. And this is very, very far beyond VR headset technology.\"",
      "ml_hf_summary": "A team of scientists at UC Berkeley conducted an experiment where laser pulses were fired into the eyes of five participants, stimulating individual cells in the retina. This stimulation resulted in a new color experience called \"olo,\" described as blue-green and saturated, which is not achievable through natural light. The researchers used a technique to map M cone locations in the retina and then stimulated them with laser pulses.  The resulting patch of color was twice the size of a full moon and beyond the range of human vision. While some experts believe this experiment does not represent a new color, it offers insights into how the brain processes visual perception and could potentially lead to advancements in understanding color blindness or diseases affecting vision. \n"

The Department for Education (DfE) is supporting teachers in addressing this issue and the NASUWT is calling for action from schools, colleges, and other agencies to protect children from dangerous influencers.

Teachers also raised concerns about parents who refuse to accept school rules or take responsibility for their children's behaviour.\nOne teacher told the union: \"A lot of the students are influenced by Tate and Trump, they spout racist, homophobic, transphobic and sexist comments in every conversation and don't believe there will be consequences.\"\nThe NASUWT's general secretary, Patrick Roach, told the union's annual conference on Friday: \"Two in three teachers tell us that social media is now a critical factor contributing to bullying and poor pupil behaviour.\n\"Pupils who believe it is their inalienable right to access their mobile phones throughout the school day - and use them to interrupt lessons, bully others, act out, or to garner respect from their peers.\"\nOne primary teacher said: \"I have had boys refuse to speak to me, and speak to a male teaching assistant instead, because I am a woman and they follow Andrew Tate and think he is amazing with all his cars and women and how women should be treated. These were 10-year-olds.\"\nOthers reported instances of boys \"barking at female staff and blocking doorways ... as a direct result of Andrew Tate videos\". Another teacher said: \"Pupils watch violent and extreme pornographic material. Their attention spans have dropped. They read lots of fake news and sensationalised stories that make them feel empowered and that they know better than the teacher.\"\nRoach said the union had \"positive discussions\" with ministers about tackling the problem but warned that restricting access to mobile phones during the school day did not go far enough. \"We now need a plan to tackle what has become a national emergency,\" he said.\nA Department for Education spokesperson said: \"We know the rise of dangerous influencers is having a damaging impact on our children, which is why we are supporting the sector in their crucial role building young people's resilience to extremism as part of our plan for change.\n\"That's why we provide a range of resources to support teachers to navigate these challenging issues, and why our curriculum review will look at the skills children need to thrive in a fast-changing online world.\n\"This is on top of wider protections being brought in for children with the Online Safety Act, to ensure children have an age-appropriate experience online.\"\nThe Liberal Democrats, however, said the union's findings showed that more needed to be done. \"Toxic algorithms are pushing many children into dark corners of the internet, where sinister attitudes that cause terrible harm in the real world, including in our schools, are free to develop,\" the party's education spokesperson, Munira Wilson, said.\nDelegates to the NASUWT conference in Liverpool heard that parents had become increasingly hostile, and even violent, when called in to discuss their child's behaviour.\nLindsay Hanger, a delegate from Norwich, said unacceptable behaviour was being tolerated in many schools in England because of a need to meet attendance targets \"at any cost\" and avoid suspensions or exclusions.\n\"I think the government needs to go further, with a strategy to ensure that all parents of school-aged children are expected to uphold behaviour strategies or risk their child being denied their place in the classroom,\" Hanger said.\nThe conference passed a motion instructing the union to oppose \"no exclusion\" policies being legitimised across the education sector - a reference to campaigns seeking to end or curtail the use of exclusions.\nRoach also told the conference that the union wanted \"a real-terms pay award for teachers this autumn that is funded fully\", warning that anything less \"will be met with the response from our members it deserves\".\nRoach told Schools Week newspaper that the NASUWT would hold a formal strike ballot in England if the government ignored recommendations for above-inflation pay increases by the independent pay review body.\nThe conference also passed a motion ordering NASUWT leaders to rule out a merger with the National Education Union (NEU) or other unions. Some members are concerned that Matt Wrack, the former leader of the Fire Brigades Union and the leading candidate to replace Roach as general secretary, supports a merger with the more leftwing NEU.",

There was no indication he met Pope Francis, who has resumed some official duties during his recovery from pneumonia.\nThe Holy See has responded cautiously to the Trump administration, in keeping with its tradition of diplomatic neutrality.\nIt has expressed alarm over Donald Trump's crackdown on immigration and cuts in international aid, and has called for peaceful resolutions to the wars in Ukraine and Gaza.\nThose concerns were reflected in the Vatican statement, which said the talks were cordial and that the Vatican expressed satisfaction with the administration's commitment to protecting freedom of religion and conscience.\n\"There was an exchange of opinions on the international situation, especially regarding countries affected by war, political tensions and difficult humanitarian situations, with particular attention to migrants, refugees, and prisoners,\" the statement said.\n\"Finally, hope was expressed for serene collaboration between the state and the Catholic church in the United States, whose valuable service to the most vulnerable people was acknowledged.\"\nThe reference to \"serene collaboration\" appeared to refer to Vance's accusation that the US conference of Catholic bishops was resettling \"illegal immigrants\" in order to obtain federal funding. Top US cardinals have pushed back strongly against the claim.\nParolin told La Repubblica on the eve of Vance's visit: \"It is clear that the approach of the current US administration is very different from what we are used to and, especially in the west, from what we have relied on for many years,.\"\nAs the US pushes to end the war in Ukraine, Parolin reaffirmed Kyiv's right to its territorial integrity and insisted that any peace deal must not be \"imposed\" on Ukraine but \"built patiently, day by day, with dialogue and mutual respect\".\nVance was spending Easter weekend in Rome with his family and attended Good Friday services in St Peter's Basilica after meeting Italy's prime minister, Giorgia Meloni. On Saturday, after the Vance family's introduction to Parolin, they had a private tour of the Sistine Chapel.\nIt was not immediately clear where they would celebrate Easter. Pope Francis, for his part, according to official liturgical plans released on Saturday, indicated he hoped to attend Easter mass on Sunday, which usually draws thousands to St Peter's Square.\nThe pope and Vance have tangled over immigration and the Trump administration's plans to deport people en masse. Francis has made caring for those who migrate a hallmark of his papacy and his progressive views on social justice issues have often put him at odds with members of the more conservative US Catholic church.\nThe pope also changed church teaching to say that capital punishment was inadmissible in all cases. After a public appeal from Francis just weeks before Trump took office, Joe Biden commuted the sentences of 37 of the 40 people on federal death row. Trump is an outspoken proponent of expanding capital punishment.\nSign up to Headlines Europe\nA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week day\nafter newsletter promotion\nVance, who converted to Catholicism in 2019, identifies with a small Catholic intellectual movement that is viewed by some critics as having reactionary or authoritarian leanings and often described as \"post-liberal\".\nPost-liberals share some longstanding Catholic conservative views, such as opposition to abortion and LGBTQ+ rights. They envision a counter-revolution in which they take over government bureaucracy and institutions such as universities from within, replacing entrenched \"elites\" with their own and acting upon their vision of the \"common good\".\nJust days before the pope was admitted to hospital in February, Francis criticised the Trump administration's deportation plans, warning that they would deprive people of their inherent dignity. In a letter to US bishops, he also appeared to respond to Vance directly for having claimed that Catholic doctrine justified such policies.\nVance had defended the administration's America-first crackdown by citing a concept from medieval Catholic theology known in Latin as ordo amoris. He said the concept delineated a hierarchy of care - to family first, followed by neighbour, community, fellow citizens and, last, those elsewhere.\nIn his 10 February letter, Francis appeared to correct Vance's understanding of the concept.\n\"Christian love is not a concentric expansion of interests that little by little extends to other persons and groups,\" he wrote. \"The true ordo amoris that must be promoted is that which we discover by meditating constantly on the parable of the good Samaritan, that is, by meditating on the love that builds a fraternity open to all, without exception.\"\nVance has acknowledged Francis' criticism but has said he will continue to defend his views. During an appearance on 28 February at the National Catholic Prayer Breakfast in Washington, Vance did not address the issue specifically but called himself a \"baby Catholic\" and acknowledged there are \"things about the faith that I don't know\".",

      "summary": "High-profile detentions and visa revocations are putting students on edge, as Trump tightens his squeeze on US schools.",
      "content": "For the last few weeks, many foreign students living in the US have watched as a sequence of events has repeated itself on their social media feeds: plain-clothes agents appearing unannounced and hauling students off in unmarked cars to detention centres.\nThose taken into custody in a string of high-profile student detentions captured on video have not faced any criminal charges and instead appear to have been targeted for involvement in pro-Palestinian protests on college campuses. \nThe Trump administration has said repeatedly that visas are a \"privilege\" and can be revoked at any time for a wide variety of reasons.\nBut the crackdown appears to be far wider than initially thought, with more than 1,000 international students or recent graduates at colleges across the US now having had their visas revoked or legal statuses changed, according to a tracker from Inside Higher Ed, an online news site covering the sector.\nFor many, the precise reasons are unknown, and universities have often only learned of the changes when checking a government-run database that logs the visa status of international students.\nThe combination of targeted detentions and reports of wide-scale visa revocations have left campuses on edge, from the biggest public universities to elite Ivy League institutions, students and faculty told the BBC.\n\"I could be next,\" said one student visa-holder attending Georgetown University, who has written articles about Israel and the war in Gaza.\nHe's begun carrying around a card in his pocket that lists his constitutional rights, in case he is ever stopped by law enforcement.\nAnother student in Texas said he's afraid to leave his apartment, even to buy groceries.\nAnd at some colleges, departments are being hit as researchers abroad refuse to return to the US.\nMost students the BBC spoke to requested anonymity out of fear that having their names in the media could make them a target.\nThe BBC has contacted the Department of Education for comment.\nThe reasons for visa cancellations vary. In some cases, criminal records appear to be a factor. Other instances have reportedly included minor legal infractions like driving over the speed limit. But \"a lot\" of those targeted have been involved in pro-Palestinian protests, Secretary of State Marco Rubio himself has said.\nIt is part of a wider White House push to crack down on protesters whom officials say created an unsafe environment for Jewish students on many campuses. They also accuse demonstrators of having expressed support for Hamas, an officially designated terrorist group. \n\"Every time I find one of these lunatics, I take away their visas,\" Rubio told reporters in late March. \"We do it every day.\"\nCivil liberties groups have protested against the detentions and moves to deport student demonstrators as a violation of constitutional rights. And the students themselves reject associations with Hamas, saying that they are being targeted for political speech about the war in Gaza and US support for Israel.\nAt Georgetown, signs that read \"protect our students\" have been taped to the doors of bathroom stalls, adding a sense of gloom to the cherry blossom trees and tulips that typically mark the arrival of spring on campus.\nA postdoctoral fellow from the university, Badar Khan Suri, was grabbed by federal agents outside his Virginia home in March. The Department of Homeland Security accused the conflict resolution researcher of \"promoting antisemitism on social media\" and having links to a \"known or suspected terrorist\". \nThis was an apparent reference to the Palestinian father of his US-born wife, a former adviser to killed Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh.\nMr Suri's lawyers say he has only met his father-in-law a handful of times and is being targeted due to his wife's identity.\nHis detention followed that of Columbia University student protest organiser Mahmoud Khalil, a permanent resident arrested at home in New York but now awaiting deportation from a facility in Louisiana.\nTufts University graduate student Rumeysa Ozturk, who co-authored a student newspaper op-ed about Gaza and was detained in Massachusetts, is also being held in Louisiana.\nLast Monday, Mohsen Mahdawi, another Columbia student protester, was detained in Vermont as he attended an interview to obtain US citizenship. Like Mr Khalil, he holds a green card, rather than a student visa.\n\"Based on the detentions that we're seeing, I think there is a possibility anyone who has been outspoken about Palestine can be detained,\" said the Georgetown student, who knew Mr Suri.\nThe White House says it is going after those who have been involved in activities that \"run counter\" to US national interests. In Mr Khalil's case, officials have cited a 1952 law that empowers the government to order someone deported if their presence in the country could pose unfavourable consequences for US foreign policy.\nIn a post on X, the Columbia Jewish Alumni Association celebrated Mr Khalil's arrest, calling him the \"ringleader of chaos\" at the university. \nPolling suggests that immigration is an issue where President Trump enjoys some of his highest approval ratings, with recent Reuters and AP-NORC surveys suggesting about half of US adults approve of action in that area, several points higher than his overall rating.\nUniversities are also being targeted at an institutional level. This week, the White House's task force on combating antisemitism froze over $2bn in funding for Harvard University, after the university refused to agree to a list of demands that it said would amount to \"surrendering its independence\".\nTrump officials have said that if Harvard doesn't comply with a request for information on certain student visaholders, it will stop granting visas to international students who want to study there.\nGeorgetown professor Nader Hashemi said he believes the government's main goal is \"silencing dissent\" by intimidating would-be protesters.\nThe Georgetown student says he has asked his parents not to fly from India to the US to see him graduate with a master's degree in just a few weeks. He is still unsure if he will even attend the ceremony.\nIn addition to checking his email daily to see if he is among the hundreds that have had their visas revoked recently, he has also prepared for the possibility of sudden arrest.\n\"I have cleared my chats across messaging apps, and I have learned how to quickly lock my phone in SOS mode,\" he said.\nGeorgetown professors have even begun offering spare rooms to students who worry about being visited by immigration agents at their residences, said Prof Hashemi.\n\"This is part of the trauma that I think students are facing,\" he said.\nAt Tufts University, outside of Boston, Massachusetts, students are waiting to see what happens to Ms Ozturk, who was detained outside her home.\nVideo shows her confused and shaking in fear as she is intercepted by agents while headed to a Ramadan dinner celebration. Last year, she had co-authored an op-ed supporting the boycott, divest and sanction (BDS) movement against Israel.\nTufts PhD student Anteri Mejr told the BBC that the actions have had a \"chilling effect\", and that international students she knows who have left the country to visit home or attend conferences are now afraid to return.\n\"There are students working remotely because they're afraid they can't get back in the country,\" he said.\nAt the University of Texas, rumours about Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids on campus have some students terrified.\n\"I'm scared to be out. I'm scared to come to school. I'm scared to go grocery shopping,\" a master's student there said.\n\"I'm afraid that if I'm walking, I will be approached by agents in incognito clothes and plain disguise,\" he continued.\nDespite being a green card holder and having not played a role in pro-Palestinian protests on campus, he says he is still in \"crippling anxiety\" because he has written things that are critical of the president.\n\"How far does this administration dig through, like, an immigrant's history?\" he asked. \"What if I did say something and I'm not aware.\"\nIranian and US officials agree to continue with a third round of high-stakes talks on a new nuclear deal.\nThe wartime Alien Enemies Act has been controversially used to deport Venezuelans to a mega-jail in El Salvador.\nThe accused gang members are being sent to a notorious jail in El Salvador under a 19th-Century law.\nWhat is happening with US bonds, why Donald Trump cares and how ordinary Americans could be affected. \nThe US says the attack on the Red Sea coast aimed to restrict supplies and funds for the Houthis, who called it a war crime.\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

Over 1,000 individuals have had their visa status changed or revoked, according to Inside Higher Ed. The White House has stated that these actions target individuals who pose a threat to US national interests, citing activities that \"run counter\" to US foreign policy.  The detentions and visa revocations are being carried out under the Trump administration's policies, which emphasize the use of immigration as a tool for political control.  These actions have created fear and uncertainty among international students, leading some to avoid returning to their home countries or even attending university events.

      "content": "These are some of the people ensnared by the administration's unprecedented measures to target people it believes oppose its agenda\nDonald Trump retook the White House vowing to stage \"the largest deportation operation in American history\". As previewed, the administration has set about further militarizing the US-Mexico border and targeting asylum seekers and refugees while conducting raids and deportations in undocumented communities, detaining and deporting immigrants and spreading fear.\nCritics are outraged, if not surprised. But few expected the new legal chapter that unfolded next: a multipronged crackdown on certain people seen as opponents of the US president's ideological agenda. This extraordinary assault has come in the context of wider attacks on higher education, the courts and the constitution.\nHere are some of the most high-profile individual cases that have captured the world's attention so far because of their extreme and legally dubious nature, mostly involving documented people targeted by the Trump administration in the course of its swift and unlawful power grab.\nIn recent weeks, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) teams suddenly began arresting and detaining foreign-born students and academics on visas or green cards. In most cases the government has cited their roles in pro-Palestinian campus protests over Israel's war in Gaza following the 7 October 2023 attack. Claims that they \"support Hamas\" are invoked as justification for wanting to deport them, even though they have not been charged with any crimes. Those taken include:\nMahmoud Khalil\nA recent graduate student of Columbia University in New York, Mahmoud Khalil, 30, is a Palestinian green card holder who was a leader during protests last year. He was arrested in front of his pregnant wife and has been in a detention center in Louisiana since mid-March.\nThe government is using obscure immigration law to make extraordinary claims in cases like Khalil's that it can summarily detain and deport people for constitutionally-protected free speech if they are deemed adverse to US foreign policy. A far-right group has claimed credit for flagging his and others' names for scrutiny by the authorities.\nRumeysa Ozturk\nUS immigration officials wearing masks and hoodies encircled and grabbed the Tufts University PhD student in a suburb of Boston and bustled her into an unmarked car, shown in onlooker video. Ozturk, a Fulbright scholar and Turkish national on a visa, had co-written an op-ed in the student newspaper, criticizing Tufts' response to Israel's military assault on Gaza and Palestinians. She was rushed into detention in Louisiana in apparent defiance of a court order. Ozturk, 30, says she has been neglected and abused there in \"unsafe and inhumane conditions\".\nMohsen Mahdawi\nMahdawi, a Palestinian green-card holder and student at Columbia University, was apprehended by Ice in Colchester, Vermont, on 14 April, according to his lawyers and a video of the incident, first reported by the Intercept.\nHe was prominent in the protests at Columbia last year. During his apprehension he was put into an unmarked car outside a federal office where he was attending an interview to become a naturalized US citizen, his lawyer said.\nYunseo Chung\nAnother student at Columbia, Chung, 21, sued the Trump administration for trying to deport her, and has gone into hiding. She is a pro-Palestinian campaigner and was arrested by the New York police in March while protesting against the university's punishments of student activists, as first reported by the New York Times. She said a government official told her lawyer they want to remove her from the country and her residency status was being revoked. Chung was born in South Korea and has been in the US since she was seven.\nAlireza Doroudi\nThe Democrats on campus group at the University of Alabama said of the arrest of Doroudi, an Iranian studying mechanical engineering: \"Donald Trump, Tom Homan [Trump's \"border czar\"], and Ice have struck a cold, vicious dagger through the heart of UA's international community.\"\nLess is known about the federal government's claims against Doroudi but it is understood he was taken to the same Ice processing center in Jena, Louisiana, where Khalil is behind bars, NBC reported.\nBadar Khan Suri\nMore than 370 alumni of Washington DC-based Georgetown University joined 65 current students there in signing on to a letter opposing immigration authorities' detention of Dr Badar Khan Suri, a senior postdoctoral fellow at the institution's Alwaleed Bin Talal Center for Muslim-Christian Understanding (ACMCU).\nThe authorities revoked his student visa, alleging the citizen of India's father-in-law was an adviser to Hamas officials more than a decade ago - and claiming he was \"deportable\" because of his posts on social media in support of Palestine. He was taken to Louisiana and then detention in Texas and was given court dates in May.\nKseniia Petrova\nThe Harvard Medical School research scientist was stopped at Boston's Logan airport by US authorities on her way back from France in February, over what appeared to be an irregularity in customs paperwork related to frog embryo samples. She was told her visa was being revoked and she was being deported to her native Russia.\nWhen Petrova, 30, said she feared political persecution there because she had criticized the invasion of Ukraine, she was taken away and also ended up in an overcrowded detention facility in Louisiana.\nMore than 1,300 international students from at least 200 colleges across the US have had their \"legal status changed\" by the state department, including the revoking of visas, between mid-March and mid-April, Inside Higher Education has reported. The specialist publication called it \"an explosion of visa terminations\".\nThe schools and students have been given little information, but secretary of state Marco Rubio has lambasted protesters and campus activists as \"lunatics\". Some have been cited for pro-Palestinian views, others concluded they must have been targeted because of minor crimes or offenses, such as a speeding ticket. Some can find no specific reason why their visa would be revoked. Many are from India and China, the Associated Press reported, and panic is setting in on campuses.\nHigh-profile cases include:\nFelipe Zapata Velasquez\nThe family of University of Florida student Felipe Zapata Velasquez, 27, said he is \"undergoing a physical and emotional recovery process\" in his native Colombia after police arrested him in Gainesville in March for traffic offenses and turned him over to Ice. He agreed to be deported, to avoid lengthy detention and legal battles. Democratic congressman Maxwell Frost accused authorities of \"kidnapping\" Velasquez.\nMomodou Taal\nTaal, a dual citizen of Britain and Gambia, was pursuing a PhD at Cornell University's Africana Studies and Research Center, and was an outspoken activist on the Ivy League campus. He was suspended last year for his role in anti-Zionist protests. He sued the Trump administration over labeling foreign student protesters anti-Semitic and was told to surrender to immigration officials. He has since left the country.\nKilmar Abrego Garcia\nThe Salvadoran man was deported to El Salvador by mistake, which the Trump administration admitted. But then it essentially defied a US supreme court order to \"facilitate\" his return to his home and family in Maryland from a brutal mega-prison in the central American country. Abrego Garcia was undocumented but had protected status against being deported to El Salvador. He was flown there anyway, without a hearing. The administration accuses him of being a violent gangster and has abandoned him, infuriating a federal judge and prompting warnings of a constitutional crisis. He has not been charged with any crimes but was swept up with hundreds of Venezuelans also deported there. Sheet metalworkers union chief Michael Coleman described Abrego Garcia as an \"apprentice working hard to pursue the American dream\" and said he was not a gang member. Trump said he was eyeing Salvadoran prisons for US citizens.\nThe US deported more than 230 Venezuelan men to the mega-prison in El Salvador without so much as a hearing in mid-March despite an infuriated federal judge trying to halt the flights, then blocking others. Donald Trump took extraordinary action to avoid due process by invoking the 1798 Alien Enemies Act (AEA), a law meant only to be used in wartime, prompting court challenges led by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU). John Roberts, the US chief justice, rebuked the president when he threatened the judge. The justices, by a majority, did not stop Trump from using the AEA but the bench unanimously reaffirmed the right to due process and said individuals must be able to bring habeas corpus challenges.\nMost of the men are reportedly not violent criminals or members of violent gangs, as the Trump administration asserts, according to a New York Times investigation.\nMany appear to have been accused of being members of the transnational Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua partly on the basis of their tattoos, with their families speaking out, including:\nAndry Jose Hernandez Romero\nSign up to Fighting Back\nBig thinkers on what we can do to protect civil liberties and fundamental freedoms in a Trump presidency. From our opinion desk.\nafter newsletter promotion\nHernandez, a 31-year-old makeup artist and hairdresser, entered California last year to attend an asylum appointment, telling the authorities he was under threat in Venezuela as a gay man. But he was detained and accused of being in Tren de Aragua because of his tattoos, then suddenly deported under Trump, deemed a \"security threat\".\nJerce Reyes Barrios\nThe former professional footballer, 36, has been accused of gang membership by the Department of Homeland Security, seemingly because of his tattoos, including one of a crown sitting atop a soccer ball with a rosary and the word \"dios\".\n\"He chose this tattoo because it is similar to the logo for his favourite soccer team, Real Madrid,\" his lawyer, Linette Tobin, said, adding that her client fled Venezuela after protesting the government and being tortured.\nFrancisco Javier Garcia Casique\nRelatives were shocked when they spotted Francisco Javier Garcia Casique, 24, in a propaganda video from El Salvador showing scores of Venezuelan prisoners being frog-marched off planes and into custody there. He is a barber in his home town of Maracay and is completely innocent of gang involvement, the family said, adding that Francisco and his brother Sebastian have matching tattoos quoting the Bible.\nA US military plane took off from California in February carrying more than 100 immigrants from countries as far flung as Afghanistan, Iran, Uzbekistan, China, Sri Lanka, Turkey and Pakistan, dumping them in Panama. They were shackled and deported to a third country because their nations of origin refuse to accept them back from the US. Shocking scenes unfolded of the people locked in a hotel in Panama City, signaling and writing on the windows pleading for help.\nThe people, including children, were then moved and held at a facility deep in the dense jungle that separates Panama from Colombia. They were later reportedly freed and were seeking asylum from other countries, their futures uncertain. One of those deported from the US was:\nArtemis Ghasemzadeh\nGhasemzadeh, 27, a migrant from Iran, wrote \"Help us\" in lipstick on a window of the hotel in Panama City, as a desperate way of alerting New York Times reporters on the street to her and fellow detainees' plight. She had thought that, especially as a convert from Islam to Christianity who faces danger in Iran as a result, that she would be offered freedom in the US, she told the newspaper while still in custody.\nAmir Makled\nMakled, a Detroit-born attorney, was questioned at the airport on returning from vacation. He was flagged to a terrorism response team, kept behind and pressured to hand over his phone, then give up some of its contents. The Lebanese American represents a pro-Palestinian student protester who was arrested at the University of Michigan. Experts said the incident was evidence of a weakening of fourth amendment constitutional protections at the border against \"unreasonable search and seizure\".\nNicole Micheroni\nThis Massachusetts immigration lawyer, a US-born American citizen, spoke out after receiving an email from the Trump administration telling her \"it is time for you to leave the United States\". She said it was \"probably, hopefully, sent to me in error. But it's a little concerning these are going out to US citizens.\" She told NBC she thought it was a scare tactic.\nJasmine Mooney, Canada\nCanadian Jasmine Mooney was shackled and ended up in Ice detention in the US for two weeks over an alleged work visa irregularity while on one of her frequent visits to California. She spoke out about the harsh conditions and the information black hole and how outraged she was that so many other detainees she met, who helped her, are stranded without access to the kind of resources that ultimately got her out.\nRebecca Burke, UK\nThe British graphic artist was stopped at the border when she headed from Seattle to Canada as a backpacker and, because of a visa mix-up, she became one of 32,809 people to be arrested by Ice during the first 50 days of Trump's presidency. Almost three weeks of grueling detention conditions later, she smuggled out her poignant drawings of fellow detainees when she was released.\nJessica Brosche, Germany\nThe German tourist and tattoo artist, 29, from Berlin was detained by US immigration authorities and deported back to Germany after spending more than six weeks in US detention, including what she described as eight days in solitary confinement. Her family compared her ordeal to \"a horror film\".\nFabian Schmidt, Germany\nThe 34-year-old German national and US green card holder was apprehended and allegedly \"violently interrogated\" by US border officials as he was returning to New Hampshire from a trip to Luxembourg. His family said he was held for hours at Boston's Logan airport, stripped naked and put in a cold shower, then later deprived of food and medicine, and collapsed. His case is being investigated and as of mid-April he was in Ice detention in Rhode Island.\n'Jonathan'\nA man with a US work visa provided his anonymous account to the Guardian of being denied entry into the US after a trip to his native Australia to scatter his sister's ashes.

      "content": "The 700,000 residents of Sudan's Zamzam camp were already among the world's most destitute people when they were attacked by paramilitary fighters last week.\nTwo decades of conflict in the Darfur region, which intensified after civil war broke out across the whole of Sudan two years ago, meant they had already fled their homes to find safety and shelter.\nThey gradually began to rebuild their lives at Zamzam, Sudan's biggest camp for internally displaced people. \nBut any sense of stability was upended when the camp was ravaged by an intense ground and aerial assault.\nZamzam was attacked by the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), which has been trying to seize the nearby city of el-Fasher from its rivals, the Sudanese army. \nThe RSF has denied reports of atrocities at Zamzam but confirmed it had taken over the camp.\nAs a result of the attack, Zamzam is \"completely destroyed\", North Darfur Health Minister Ibrahim Khater told the BBC's Newsday programme.\n\"No-one is there,\" he said.\nAmong the many thousands who fled Zamzam was 28-year-old Fathiya Mohammed, who had been at the camp for three months.\nShe walked barefoot for four days before reaching the town of Tawila.\n\"I was carrying one child on my back, another in my arms, and luggage on my head,\" she told the BBC.\nShe lost her husband during the chaos of the attack and still does not know where he is.\nThe family were attacked by thieves on the journey to Tawila, Ms Mohammed said, and they endured exhaustion, hunger and thirst.\nMedical charity Doctors Without Borders (MSF) says that tens of thousands of people have fled from Zamzam to Tawila since the attack.\nSaadiya Adam left the camp with her children aged two and five after her makeshift home was destroyed.\n\"They burned my house in Zamzam and they burned my sheep,\" said Ms Adam, who had been living in Zamzam for two months.\n\"Everything I owned was burned. I have nothing left.\"\nImages filmed by a freelance journalist working for the BBC show thousands of internally displaced people entering Tawila by foot, truck and donkey cart.\nThese arrivals face overwhelmed facilities - MSF said that over two days, more than 20,000 people have sought treatment at the hospital it runs in Tawila.\n\"We see many people injured by bullets, it is becoming routine,\" said head nurse Tiphaine Salmon.\n\"Yesterday it was a seven-month-old baby who just stared and could no longer cry - she had bullet injuries under the chin and on the shoulder.\"\nOne patient at Tawila hospital described coming under attack at Zamzam.\n''We were six of us, we encountered RSF,\" said Issa Abdullah.\n\"Three vehicles opened fire over us. They hit me on the head. A bullet came near my mouth. I'm OK now, but there are others in worse condition.\"\nHussein Khamis was shot in the leg during the attack.\n\"After I was injured, there was no-one to carry me,\" he said. \nMr Khamis managed to reach a nearby hospital despite his injury, but he \"found no-one, everyone had fled\".\nEventually he managed to get a lift to Tawila. Like Ms Mohammed, he says he was robbed along the way.\nThe RSF has not commented on these specific allegations.\nMSF said that it had received more than 170 people with gunshot and blast injuries in Tawila since the attack, 40% of whom have been women and girls.\n\"People tell us that many injured and vulnerable people could not make the trip to Tawila and were left behind. Almost everyone we talk to said they lost at least one family member during the attack,\" said Marion Ramstein, MSF's project coordinator in Tawila.\nZamzam was established in 2004 to house internally displaced people fleeing ethnic violence in Darfur.\nIts seizure would be strategically significant for the RSF, which last month lost control of Sudan's capital, Khartoum.\nThe RSF remains in control of much of western Sudan, including most of Darfur. \nThis week the group announced plans to launch a parallel government in the parts of Sudan in controls, heightening fears Sudan could ultimately split in two.\nSafe, at least for now, Ms Mohammed reflected on the immense loss this war has caused those like her.\n\"We want the war to stop,\" she said. \"Peace is the most important thing.\"\nGo to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent. \n Follow us on Twitter @BBCAfrica, on Facebook at BBC Africa or on Instagram at bbcafrica\nThe defendants get sentences of up to 66 years after a trial described by a defence lawyer as a farce.\nA top Somali actor is targeted in a revenge killing shortly after making a film warning about such feuds.\nSeasoned business executive Tidjane Thiam is named as the candidate for Ivory Coast's main opposition party.\nA selection of the week's best photos from across the African continent and beyond.\nThe US says a new Zambian law is more intrusive than equivalents in many other countries.\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

      "content": "On 11 April Rapid Support Forces paramilitaries attacked the country's largest displacement camp. The extent of the brutality remains unclear, but some accounts are now emerging\nOnce they had massed on the perimeter of Sudan's Zamzam camp, the Rapid Support Forces began the onslaught - shelling, firing from anti-aircraft guns mounted on pickup trucks and storming into the camp chanting racial slurs as they fired on their victims.\nAn estimated 700,000 people had sought refuge in Zamzam, Sudan's largest displacement camp, but last weekend they were forced to seek cover and plot the best escape route. Most had fled these fighters before.\nThose who were able gathered any belongings that could be carried on their backs or flung on to donkeys and camels and rushed to begin the long walk to El Fasher city, 14km (8.7 miles) away, or Tawila displacement camp, 60km west of Zamzam.\nMohamed*, a community organiser, tells the Guardian he tried to sneak past the fighters to reach the medical centre staffed by the NGO Relief International that was hit during the early stages of the attack on 11 April, when nine staff were killed, including one of his friends.\n\"They were barbaric, inhumane. They were chanting as they killed people in their homes. It is behaviour you wouldn't even find in the wilderness,\" he says, adding that the fighters, who claimed to be seeking Sudanese government fighters hiding in the camp, attacked people in their homes or in their cars as they tried to escape.\n\"I ran into an RSF vehicle - the fighters were shouting racist slurs and started firing at us. I was shot in my right leg, then someone who was hiding in one of the homes dragged me inside.\"\nRescuers had only salt and leaves to treat and dress his wound. They spent the next two days in hiding.\nThe battle for Zamzam raged for three days. The RSF and its allied militias claimed they had seized control of it on 13 April. At least 400 civilians, including women and children, had been killed in Zamzam and nearby Um Kadada by 15 April, according to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, although it says it has not had access to assess the real scale of the damage.\nFor most people this is not the first time they have escaped from the RSF. The camp grew in size during the current civil war, as people fled other parts of Darfur taken by the RSF, a collection of militia who follow the former warlord Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, known as Hemedti. But the camp has existed since the 2000s, before the war. The longer-term inhabitants fled similar violence by the RSF in its prior form as the Janjaweed militias.\nAnother Zamzam resident says he was in his house when the shelling started, causing a fire to break out around him. The neighbours banded together, gathered the elderly people and ran towards the north for the road to El Fasher.\n\"The shelling was intense. People started running everywhere, to the south, east, west. The shelling was so intense and they were using all types of heavy weaponry, we couldn't even speak to each other. We walked by foot - it was tiring and difficult. We would take breaks to sit and sometimes people just collapsed on the ground.\"\nThe UN estimates 400,000 people had fled Zamzam by Tuesday, heading either to El Fasher or to Tawila.\nMedecins Sans Frontieres' project coordinator for North Darfur, Marion Ramstein, says 10,000 people arrived in Tawila in the first 48 hours of the onslaught on Zamzam, most in an advanced state of dehydration and exhaustion.\n\"Some children were literally dying of thirst upon arrival, after travelling for two days under a burning sun, without a single drop of water to drink,\" says Ramstein, who says the hospitals are so overcrowded that children are having to share beds.\nA displaced person already living in Tawila says he saw thousands of families arrive in Tawila hungry, thirsty and often with injuries after the arduous journey.\n\"Many of them came on foot. Some of those who had cars were stopped on the way and then looted [by fighters] and many of the youth were disappeared or killed,\" he says. \"The families here are out in the open without water.\"\nThe situation is similar in El Fasher, where the man who fled his burning home in Zamzam says most of the injured are still waiting to be treated or have been given crude first aid, such as using fire to cauterise their wounds.\nA doctor in El Fasher says there is an urgent need for shelter, food and water but the area's ability to provide them is limited by a year of siege on El Fasher and its vicinity - the last major city in Darfur that the RSF does not yet control after more than two years of war.\n\"Even now I can hear the rumbling of heavy artillery nearby. The RSF is always bombing somewhere in El Fasher, 24 hours,\" he says. \"RSF has looted all the outskirts of El Fasher, killing many people, burned a lot of villages, looted their property.\"\nThe siege has meant that prices in the food markets are high. According to a list of market prices distributed by the North Darfur governorate, after the attack on Zamzam the price of a kilogram of wheat rose 3,000 Sudanese pounds (PS3.80) to 15,000 when bought with cash but was as high as 22,000 when bought using mobile banking, which most people rely on. Famine had already taken hold in Zamzam camp, and the latest fighting has added to the crisis.\nWhile at least half of Zamzam's population has fled, a significant number are unable to leave. Mohamed and other campaigners accuse the RSF of holding them hostage and using them as human shields to prevent the Sudanese army from launching a counterattack.\nHe says fighters are stopping people on the roads and choosing who they allow to pass based on skin colour.\n\"The main goal is a full-scale mass genocide and to displace any tribe not associated with the RSF,\" says Mohamed.\nA communications blackout has meant that details of the aftermath of the attack and how many people have been killed and injured cannot be established but information is slowly trickling to families outside Darfur.\nAltahir Hashim, a UK-based Darfuri campaigner, says that only after several days did he discover that his mother and siblings were able to escape but that several of his cousins had died. Many of his friends also lost family members.\nAccording to the Yale School of Public Health's Humanitarian Research Lab, which uses satellite imagery to monitor violence in Sudan, fires continued to spread after the RSF took control of Zamzam, with 1.7 sq km of the camp - equivalent to 24 football pitches - destroyed by fire between 11 and 16 April.\n\"Even until now the people who are still in the camp are being killed and raped. Even those who tried to escape to the west, they brought some of the little girls back, the elderly and they are killing them. Until now there are many wounded who have not been treated,\" he says.\n\"The people [who escaped] are truly exhausted because what happened in Zamzam is a serious tragedy. They're indescribable, things that have not happened in humanity before.\"\n* Name has been changed",
      "ml_hf_summary": "On April 11th, Rapid Support Forces (RSF) paramilitaries attacked the Zamzam displacement camp in Sudan, killing at least 400 civilians and injuring many more. The attack involved shelling, gunfire from anti-aircraft guns, and racist slurs as fighters stormed the camp.  An estimated 700,000 people were displaced to Zamzam, seeking refuge from ongoing conflict.  The RSF claimed control of the camp on April 13th, but fighting continued for three days. The UN estimates that over 400,000 people have fled Zamzam and are now in El Fasher or Tawila camps.  Hospitals in these areas are overwhelmed with injured civilians, many suffering from dehydration and exhaustion after a long journey.  The RSF has been accused of using the displaced population as human shields and targeting specific ethnic groups. The attack on Zamzam has exacerbated an existing humanitarian crisis in Darfur, with food prices rising sharply and access to basic necessities limited by the ongoing siege on El Fasher. \n"

He told BBC News that the main culprit is still at large, but that police have made 40 arrests so far.\nA bullet fired from that distance is not usually fatal, but a post-mortem found that after hitting his shoulder, the bullet travelled towards his chest.\nMr Ismail told BBC News there was no evidence so far that suggested Mr Nawaz was the intended target and the shooting may have been accidental.\nAcross Pakistan, influential figures have condemned the war in Gaza.\nThe Islamist party, Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) has called for protests against Israel and the US, but has denied any involvement in the attacks on KFC.\nPakistan's most influential Sunni scholar, Mufti Taqi Usmani, has encouraged a boycott of products perceived to be linked to the war.\nBut both have urged protesters to avoid resorting to violence.\nUsmani said in remarks made at the National Palestine Conference on Thursday that while it was essential to boycott products and companies from or linked to Israel, Islam \"is not a religion that encourages harming others\" and said it is prohibited to \"throw stones or put anyone's life at risk\". \n\"So, continue your protest and boycott, but do so in a peaceful manner.

      "summary": "The US says the attack on the Red Sea coast aimed to restrict supplies and funds for the Houthis, who called it a war crime.",
      "content": "US air strikes on a key oil terminal on Yemen's Red Sea coast controlled by the Houthi movement have killed at least 74 people and wounded 171 others, the Houthi-run health ministry says.\nThe US military said it had destroyed Ras Isa \"to eliminate this source of fuel for the Iran-backed Houthi terrorists and deprive them of illegal revenue\".\nThe Houthi-led government in north-west Yemen said the terminal was a civilian facility and that the strikes constituted a \"war crime\".\nIt was the deadliest known attack since President Donald Trump ordered an intensification of the US bombing campaign last month in response to Houthi attacks on Red Sea shipping and Israel linked to the Gaza war.\nSeveral hours after the strikes on Ras Isa, the Israeli military said it had intercepted a missile launched from Yemen. \nSirens sounded in several Israeli areas but there were no reports of any casualties or damage.\nHouthi-run Al-Masirah TV reported that 14 air strikes hit Ras Isa late on Thursday.\nVideos posted online purportedly showed several explosions, large fires and destroyed fuel tankers at the facility, which is about 60km (35 miles) north of the Red Sea city of Hudaydah.\n\"We ran away. The strikes came one after the other, then everything was on fire,\" one man who said he worked there told the channel.\nOn Thursday afternoon, Houthi health ministry spokesman Anees al-Asbahi said the death toll had reached 74, adding that rescue teams were still searching for casualties.\nAl-Masirah had earlier cited local health authorities as saying many of the dead were workers at Ras Isa. It also reported that five paramedics were killed in secondary US strikes as they arrived at the scene.\nThe casualty reports could not be immediately verified, but graphic footage from Al-Masirah appeared to show at least 10 charred bodies near the burning tankers, including one driver, as well as men being treated for serious burns in hospital.\n\"We affirm that the targeting of the Ras Isa oil port is a full-fledged war crime, as the port is a civilian facility and not a military one,\" the Houthi-run government said in a statement.\n\"We hold the US administration fully responsible for the consequences resulting from its escalation in the Red Sea,\" it warned. \n On Friday, thousands of Houthi supporters held a rally in the capital Sanaa, condemning the US strikes.\nThe US military's Central Command said in a statement that the \"objective of these strikes was to degrade the economic source of power of the Houthis, who continue to exploit and bring great pain upon their fellow countrymen\".\n\"The Houthis, their Iranian masters, and those who knowingly aid and abet their terrorist actions should be put on notice that the world will not accept illicit smuggling of fuel and war material to a terrorist organisation,\" it added.\nIran's foreign ministry said it strongly condemned the strikes as \"barbaric\".\nOn Thursday, the Houthis' leader gave a defiant speech in which he claimed the recent US strikes failed to stop their attacks.\nAbdul Malik al-Houthi said the group's forces had carried out almost 80 operations involving around 170 missiles and drones since mid-March, including 30 attacks targeting the US aircraft carrier USS Harry S Truman and 26 attacks on Israel.\nYemen has been devastated by a civil war that escalated 10 years ago, when the Houthis seized control of the country's north-west from the internationally-recognised government and a Saudi-led coalition supported by the US intervened in an effort to restore its rule.\nThe fighting has reportedly left more than 150,000 people dead and triggered a humanitarian disaster, with 4.8 million people displaced and 19.5 million - half of the population - in need of some form of aid.\nSince November 2023, the Houthis have targeted dozens of merchant vessels with missiles, drones and small boat attacks in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden. They have sunk two vessels, seized a third, and killed four crew members.\nThe Houthis have said they are acting in support of the Palestinians in the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, and have claimed - often falsely - that they are targeting ships only linked to Israel, the US or the UK.\nThe Houthis were not deterred by the deployment of Western warships in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden to protect merchant vessels last year, or by multiple rounds of US strikes on military targets ordered by former President Joe Biden.\nAfter taking office in January, Trump redesignated the Houthis as a \"Foreign Terrorist Organisation\" - something the Biden administration had removed due to what it said was the need to mitigate the country's humanitarian crisis.\nLast month, Trump ordered large-scale strikes on areas controlled by the Houthis and threatened that they would be \"completely annihilated\". He has also warned Iran not to arm the group - something it has repeatedly denied doing.\nHouthi-run authorities have said the strikes have killed dozens of civilians in recent weeks, but they have reported few casualties among the group's members.\nEarlier this month, Trump posted a black-and-white video from an aircraft that showed a strike targeting about 70 people gathered in a circle whom he identified as Houthis. But the Houthi-run Saba news agency cited a source as saying it was \"a social Eid visit\" in Hudaydah province.\nIsrael has also carried out air strikes against the Houthis since last July in retaliation for the hundreds of missiles and drones that the Israeli military says have been launched at the country from Yemen, most of which have been shot down.\nThe wartime Alien Enemies Act has been controversially used to deport Venezuelans to a mega-jail in El Salvador.\nThe accused gang members are being sent to a notorious jail in El Salvador under a 19th-Century law.\nWhat is happening with US bonds, why Donald Trump cares and how ordinary Americans could be affected. \nSen Chris Van Hollen returned from El Salvador and spoke about his time meeting with Kilmar Abrego Garcia.\nBBC Verify looks at the evidence behind allegations that the Salvadoran mistakenly deported to a mega-prison was a dangerous gang member.\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

      "ml_hf_summary": "On Thursday, US airstrikes on Ras Isa oil terminal in Yemen killed at least 74 people and wounded 171 others, according to the Houthi-run health ministry. The US military claims the strikes targeted a source of fuel for the Houthis, who are backed by Iran.  The Houthi government condemned the attack as a war crime, stating the terminal was a civilian facility. This incident follows a recent escalation in US bombing campaign against the Houthis following attacks on Red Sea shipping and Israel-linked vessels. The Israeli military intercepted a missile launched from Yemen shortly after the strikes. The casualty reports are still being verified but graphic footage shows significant damage to the terminal, including charred bodies.  The conflict in Yemen has been ongoing for over 10 years, with the Houthis seizing control of the country's north-west and a Saudi-led coalition intervening to restore the internationally recognized government. This latest incident highlights the complex geopolitical situation in Yemen and its impact on regional stability. \n"

      "content": "Watch CBS News \n Updated on: April 18, 2025 / 6:02 AM EDT\n / CBS/AP \n Dubai, United Arab Emirates -- U.S. airstrikes targeting the Ras Isa oil port held by Yemen's Houthi rebels killed 58 people and wounded 126 others, the group said Friday, marking what appeared to be the single-deadliest known attack under President Trump's new campaign targeting the rebels.\nAssessing the toll of Mr. Trump's campaign, which began March 15, has been incredibly difficult as the U.S. military's Central Command so far hasn't released any information on the campaign, its specific targets and how many people have been killed. Meanwhile, Yemen's Houthi rebels strictly control access to areas attacked and don't publish information on the strikes, many of which likely have targeted military and security sites. \nBut the strike on the Ras Isa oil port, which sent massive fireballs shooting into the night sky, represented a major escalation of the American campaign. The Houthis also immediately released graphic footage of those killed in the attack.\nThe war in Yemen, meanwhile, was further internationalized as the U.S. alleged a Chinese satellite company was \"directly supporting\" Houthi attacks, something Beijing didn't immediately acknowledge. \nThe Houthis' al-Masirah satellite news channel aired graphic footage of the aftermath of the attack on Ras Isa port, showing corpses strewn across the site. It said paramedic and civilians workers at the port had been killed in the attack, which sparked a massive explosion and fires.\nIn a statement, Central Command said \"U.S. forces took action to eliminate this source of fuel for the Iran-backed Houthi terrorists and deprive them of illegal revenue that has funded Houthi efforts to terrorize the entire region for over 10 years.\" \n\"This strike was not intended to harm the people of Yemen, who rightly want to throw off the yoke of Houthi subjugation and live peacefully,\" it added. It didn't acknowledge any casualties and declined to comment when asked by The Associated Press regarding civilians reportedly being killed.\nThe Ras Isa port, a collection of three oil tanks and refining equipment, sits in Yemen's Hodeida governorate along the Red Sea. NASA satellites that track forest fires showed an intense blaze early Friday morning at the site just off Kamaran Island, targeted by intense U.S. airstrikes over the last few days.\nThe Ras Isa port also is the terminus of an oil pipeline stretching to Yemen's energy-rich Marib governorate that's still held by allies of Yemen's exiled government. The Houthis expelled that government from Yemen's capital, Sanaa, back in 2015. However, oil exports have been halted by the decadelong war and the Houthis have used Ras Isa to bring in oil.\nThe Houthis and Iran denounced the U.S. attack. \n\"This completely unjustified aggression represents a flagrant violation of Yemen's sovereignty and independence and a direct targeting of the entire Yemeni people,\" the Houthis said in a statement carried by the SABA news agency they control. \"It targets a vital civilian facility that has served the Yemeni people for decades.\"\nIranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Esmaeil Baqaei said Tehran \"strongly condemned the barbaric U.S. air strike,\" calling it \"an example of aggressive crime and a blatant violation of the fundamental principles of the U.N. Charter,\" according to French news agency AFP.\nOn April 9, the U.S. State Department issued a warning about oil shipments to Yemen. \n\"The United States will not tolerate any country or commercial entity providing support to foreign terrorist organizations, such as the Houthis, including offloading ships and provisioning oil at Houthi-controlled ports,\" it said. \nThe attack follows Israeli airstrikes on the Houthis that previously hit port and oil infrastructure used by the rebels after their attacks on Israel.\nMeanwhile, U.S. State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce in a briefing with journalists accused Chang Guang Satellite Technology Co. Ltd., a commercial satellite image provider, of \"directly supporting Iran-backed Houthi terrorist attacks on U.S. interests.\" \nBruce didn't elaborate in detail, but acknowledged a story by The Financial Times that quoted anonymous American officials saying the firm linked to the People's Liberation Army has provided images enabling the rebels to target U.S. warships and commercial vessels traveling through the Red Sea corridor. \n\"Beijing's support, by the way, of that company, the satellite company, even after we've engaged in discussions with them about this ... certainly contradicts their claims of being peace supporters,\" Bruce said. \nChinese officials and the company, known by the acronym CGSTL, couldn't be immediately reached for comment. Chinese state media didn't acknowledge the accusation. The U.S. Treasury sanctioned CGSTL in 2023 for allegedly providing satellite images to the Russian mercenary force the Wagner Group as it fought in Ukraine as part of Russia's full-scale invasion. \nAn AP review has found the new U.S. operation against the Houthis under Mr. Trump appears more extensive than the one under former President Joe Biden, as Washington moves from solely targeting launch sites to firing at ranking personnel and dropping bombs on cities. \nThe new campaign of airstrikes started after the rebels threatened to begin targeting \"Israeli\" ships again over Israel blocking aid entering the Gaza Strip as that war grinds on. The rebels have loosely defined what constitutes an Israeli ship, meaning many vessels could be targeted. \nThe Houthis targeted more than 100 merchant vessels with missiles and drones, sinking two and killing four sailors from November 2023 until January of this year. That's greatly reduced the flow of trade through the Red Sea corridor, which typically sees $1 trillion of goods move through it. The Houthis also launched attacks targeting American warships, without success. \nThe U.S. campaign shows no signs of stopping, as the Trump administration has also linked its airstrikes on the Houthis to an effort to pressure Iran over its rapidly advancing nuclear program. A second round of negotiations between Iran and the U.S. is due to happen Saturday in Rome.\nThe stakes of the negotiations couldn't be higher for the two nations closing in on half a century of enmity. Mr, Trump repeatedly has threatened to unleash airstrikes targeting Iran's nuclear program if a deal isn't reached. Iranian officials increasingly warn that they could pursue a nuclear weapon with their stockpile of uranium enriched to near weapons-grade levels. \n (c) 2025 CBS Interactive Inc.

The strikes were part of a campaign launched by President Trump's administration against the Houthis, which has escalated since March 15th.  The U.S. claims these actions are aimed at disrupting Houthi funding for terrorism and removing their ability to fuel attacks.

The 7.7 magnitude quake was so strong it was felt in Thailand and south-west China. \nAccording to state media, over 3,500 people were killed and 5,012 were injured in Myanmar as a result of the quake. \nThe city of Nay Pyi Taw covers at least four times the area of London, but with only a fraction of the people. Its history is short: it has only existed since 2005, raised out of the flatlands by the then military rulers of Myanmar, which was previously known as Burma. \nThe name Nay Pyi Taw means \"seat of the king\". The reasons for moving the capital some 370km inland from the largest city, Yangon, have never been entirely clear.\nThe city bears all the hallmarks of a planned capital: the road leading from parliament to the presidential palace is 20 lanes wide, but carries hardly any traffic. Shiny shopping malls and empty luxury hotels line the boulevards. There's a safari park, a zoo, and at least three stadiums. \nSince 2021, Myanmar has been plagued by civil war between the junta, which seized power in a military coup, and ethnic militias and resistance forces across the country. \nA 20-day ceasefire was declared by the military council on 2 April, following the announcement of a pause in hostilities by an alliance made up of three rebel groups. \nThe ceasefires were announced to help relief efforts, but the military has reportedly continued to attack rebel-held areas. \nThe military council's photo archives show that several government buildings, including the Ministry of Labour, Ministry of Planning and the Court of the Union were severely damaged in the earthquake. \nMost of the buildings are still in ruins as repair work on them has not yet started. \nThe removal of important government documents has reportedly been ordered, along with equipment and other moveable items. \nReconstruction of the buildings could take years, and as a result, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Tourism have reportedly moved their offices to the former capital Yangon - 366km (228m) away. \nOther departments are relocating their offices to open air halls called \"hotai\" in Nay Pyi Taw, which are built with steel frames. \nSocial media posts written by staff at the National Museum in Nay Pyi Taw say they have moved inscriptions and manuscripts and are trying to save as many as possible of the tens of thousands of books, along with literature and computers. \nCopyright 2025 BBC.

Two more civilians, including a 13-year-old girl, died from bombing by military aircraft on April 10, the Myanmar Now news outlet reports.\nA Sagaing-based PDF fighter who requested anonymity said some rebel units had pivoted to relief efforts in central Myanmar even though their military adversaries were taking advantage of the lull in battle.\n\"Since the quake, the military has used the Sagaing-Monywa road more confidently because of the truce,\" she said. But PDF forces in Sagaing expect fighting to intensify after the April truce is over.\n\"The PDF has more momentum than the military here,\" she told Al Jazeera, adding that the NUG is now \"coordinating better with ethnic armed organisations\".\n\"There will be more fighting in coming months,\" said Ko Ko Gyi of the Sagaing PDF's Battalion 3. \n Regional security analyst Anthony Davis said he doubted the earthquake would distract the military from its strategic objectives, adding that most soldiers had stayed in their garrisons rather than help with relief efforts.\n\"The military isn't taking time off to save people. They'll keep up the air strikes and, where possible, launch ground offensives to weaken the PDF,\" Davis said.\nBut it is western Rakhine State - largely spared from the earthquake - that is still the most consequential battleground currently, he said.\nThere, the rebel Arakan Army (AA) has clashed with the military's forces around the state capital Sittwe and Kyaukphyu, the site of a key pipeline that transports gas from across Myanmar to China.\nThe AA has simultaneously pushed out of its home territory in the west of the country and into Myanmar's central heartlands in Magwe, Bago and Ayeyarwady regions, Davis said.\n\"They are the swing player who can significantly move this conflict one way or another,\" he added.\nCommanding an estimated 40,000 soldiers, the AA has a proven record of defeating the military regime's forces. \n In eastern Myanmar's Kayah State, a senior resistance commander said the earthquake had underscored the suffering of displaced communities who \"bear the brunt of the ongoing wars\".\n\"The side who's willing to care for the people can sway public opinion and will succeed in the coming battles,\" he said.\nIn the north and northwest, the military is on the back foot.\nThe Kachin Independence Army captured Indaw town in the northern Sagaing Region on April 7 after an eight-month siege, despite declaring its own post-quake truce. Chin resistance forces recently gained control of Falam township in western Myanmar - though they had not announced any ceasefire.\nPolitical analyst Kyaw Hsan Hlaing said the military is still grappling with the aftermath of the earthquake and that may create openings for the AA and others to seize more towns.\n\"However, any such gains would likely be incremental, as the military's longstanding control and ability to adapt, especially in regions like Bago and Magwe, even under crisis conditions remain significant,\" he said.\n\"In the long term, the earthquake is unlikely to fundamentally shift the balance of power in Myanmar,\" he said.\nWhile the earthquake has not dealt a decisive blow to military rule, the quake has delivered a psychic shock to the regime's generals.\nIn a country where astrology and superstition guide the highest political decisions, many interpret the natural disaster as a cosmic rebuke against Myanmar's military leadership.\n\"They see this earthquake as divine intervention - punishment for the mistakes of the king. From what I hear, they are not blaming him [regime leader Min Aung Hlaing] directly. But there are questions about his leadership and capacity,\" said former major Tin Lin Aung, who still maintains contacts within the secretive military establishment.\nAccording to Tin Lin Aung, the regime has ordered civil servants nationwide to recite a protective Buddhist chant nine times daily for nine consecutive days. The number nine has auspicious symbolism in Buddhist tradition.\nHe also described growing confusion within the ranks over the regime's response to the earthquake - appealing for international aid and assistance, declaring a truce, while also continuing its attacks.\n\"They know the people hate them more and more, and their leader seems lost,\" he said. \n Richard Horsey, senior Myanmar adviser at the International Crisis Group, said even if Myanmar military's commander-in-chief Senior General Min Aung Hlaing dismisses these supernatural interpretations, the fact that his inner circle takes them seriously creates real vulnerability. Instead of causing an internal coup, he suggested the quake as a bad omen would more likely signal the erosion of Min Aung Hlaing's authority and the rise of open criticism.\n\"You go from there to people feeling they can just ignore his orders and do their own thing because everyone else agrees with them, not him,\" he said.\nPolitical analyst Kyaw Hsan Hlaing said some sources suggest that beliefs in the quake as a portent of collapse for military rule may be used to push the narrative that the regime needs to \"act decisively to regain control\".\nSuperstition is just one of many factors shaping the military's decisions in the conflict, he added.\nThe earthquake has also \"done enormous damage to the basic fabric of Myanmar,\" Horsey said, noting that Mandalay's residents are potentially facing relocation due to extensive housing damage.\nGiven the scale of the quake, it would likely affect the civil war - \"but in ways that are hard to predict\", he said.\nCriticised for its ineffectual and disinterested response to earthquake victims, along with continued attacks at a time of national emergency, the military's poor reputation has plummeted even further in the eyes of the people and its adversaries.\nThe powerful ethnic armed groups involved in the conflict will probably be even more unwilling to negotiate for peace with the military following the quake, Horsey said.\n\"Even if you could get a spirit of compromise, which seems not to exist\", few would believe the military's sincerity in adhering to any peace deal or ceasefire document.\n\"Who would believe that piece of paper,\" Horsey said, when it is signed by a military that is considered \"so illegitimate and so incompetent.\" \n Follow Al Jazeera English:",
      "ml_hf_summary": "A magnitude 7.7 earthquake struck Myanmar on March 28th, killing over 3,600 people and causing widespread destruction. The quake has exacerbated the ongoing civil war in Myanmar, with the military facing increasing pressure from both ethnic armed groups and opposition forces.  The military's ammunition production has been disrupted due to the earthquake's impact on factories, while their air strikes and ground offensives continue despite a truce declared for the affected areas. Resistance groups like the People's Defence Force are gaining ground in some regions, capturing towns previously under military control. The earthquake has also impacted public opinion of the military regime, with many interpreting it as divine punishment for the regime's actions.  The long-term impact on the conflict remains uncertain, but the earthquake is likely to further complicate negotiations and increase tensions within Myanmar. \n"

Mutual Fund and ETF data provided by Refinitiv Lipper.\n \n White House Faith Office members Paula White and Jennifer Korn detailed to Fox News Digital the events taking place during Holy Week and shared the Trump administration's faith goals.\nFive years ago, our country's Christians experienced an Easter like none before it, and hopefully like none we will ever see again. It was a time of isolation, loneliness and anxiety, and yet today, we are learning that out of this darkness, the flame of our faith has only grown brighter.\nPrior to the COVID pandemic, few Americans could have even imagined any day, let alone an Easter Sunday, upon which we could not go to church. This is, after all, a nation created by people who were seeking the freedom to worship however they pleased.\nAll throughout Lent in 2020, which eerily tracked with the emergence of the Chinese virus, I recall hearing the Brooklyn church bells peeling, piercing the strange silence of the empty urban landscape.\nINSIDE DONALD TRUMP'S RELATIONSHIP WITH GOD, IN HIS OWN WORDS: 'I WAS SAVED'\nBut the church doors were locked tight on epidemiologists' orders.\nThe sound of the bells mingled consolation with mockery, a harsh reminder of the spiritual prohibition, but also ringing with the promise and the truth that this too would pass. \nAt the time, separated from my family, I wrote in a column for the New York Post that \"we have given up each other for Lent. But as we awake on Sunday to the surreal reality of current circumstance, there is hope we will see each other again.\"\nAs we celebrate the Lord's resurrection this year, not only have the COVID lockdowns passed, not only are our churches open, but they are packed to the brim with flocks of the faithful, new and old, in what some have called another American religious revival.\nAt church, things can be beautiful and true and celebrated, unlike the snark-filled world of our screens that thrives on cruel jokes.\nThis week, that same New York Post ran an article with the glorious headline, \"Young people are converting to Catholicism en masse -- driven by pandemic, internet, 'lax' alternatives.\"\nThe National Catholic Register reports that Catholic parishes across the nation are experiencing 30-70% growth in attendance, and it's not just Catholics. Ask any practicing Christian in our country, and I meet a lot on the road, and most will tell you they see and feel the growth in the faith.\nPeople attend Sunday mass at Saint Patricks Catholic Cathedral, in New York city, on October 16, 2022. ((Photo by Daniel SLIM / AFP) (Photo by DANIEL SLIM/AFP via Getty Images))\nPerhaps we should not be surprised that the bitter cup of COVID led to greater religious observance by Christians. After all the Holy Spirit, speaking through the prophets, has told for thousands of years of periods of loss and suffering that end in the fullness of God's light.\nFrom the banishment from Eden, to the Flood, to the Exodus, and finally Christ's 40 days of starvation and temptation in the desert, again and again, it is suffering that brings God's people closest to Him.\nDuring COVID, our desert was isolation, and especially for young people, it only exacerbated what was already a trend of smartphones replacing playgrounds, of virtual life online slowly supplanting reality.\nAt church, everything is very real, much as it has been for more than a thousand years. At church, we are never alone. At church, things can be beautiful and true and celebrated, unlike the snark-filled world of our screens that thrives on cruel jokes.\nHuman beings need a purpose and meaning beyond being a cog in the brave new world of tech. We need connection to our God and to each other.\nAnd so we should think back to our cold, dark COVID Easter this year, as spring brightens the clouds and warms the grass across this nation, and remember that once again, like always, God has delivered us from suffering.\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\nThis year, there will be family and friends, handshakes and hugs. There will be no masks, and life will be well-lived, like in the good old days, like in the old normal.\nMaybe more than anything else, we all learned the hard way not to take the practice of our faith for granted. We never thought it could be taken from us, and yet it was, though thankfully only briefly.\nThe other night, I had to pick up my son from his CCD class at church. It was after 9 p.m. and the class was running late. I was tired and annoyed, but then I saw him and his buddies walking out, laughing, having just spent an hour talking about God. \nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nA feeling of gratitude washed over me. I didn't have to be there, I got to be there. This wasn't a burden, it was a blessing. \nIs America poised for a new religious revival out of the ashes of COVID? It may be too soon to say, but in the end, it is up to us, and so far, the signs are looking pretty good.\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM DAVID MARCUS\nDavid Marcus is a columnist living in West Virginia and the author of \"Charade: The COVID Lies That Crushed A Nation.\"\nGet the recap of top opinion commentary and original content throughout the week.\nBy entering your email and clicking the Subscribe button, you agree to the Fox News Privacy Policy and Terms of Use, and\n agree to receive content and promotional communications from Fox News.

They are going to do a second fest - that's what it is. It is beautiful,\" he said during an impromptu Oval Office moment.\nThe question was, did this \"fest\" - which Mr Trump suggested could happen in September - amount to the much hyped second state visit for the American president?\nOr was this actually just the smaller visit that had been offered two months ago as an initial bilateral visit at which the state visit would be discussed?\nBack in February, Sir Keir Starmer presented the president with a letter from King Charles and the offer of a state visit.\nThe letter proposed an initial meeting between the King and the president to discuss details of the state visit at either Dumfries House or Balmoral, both in Scotland, close to Mr Trump's golf clubs.\nThe King wrote: \"Quite apart from this presenting an opportunity to discuss a wide range of issues of mutual interest, it would also offer a valuable chance to plan a historic second state visit to the United Kingdom... As you will know this is unprecedented by a US president. That is why I would find it helpful for us to be able to discuss, together, a range of options for location and programme content.\"\nAs he revealed the news of his \"fest\" with his \"friend Charles\", Mr Trump said: \"I think they are setting a date for September...\"\nSources have since confirmed to Sky News that it will amount to the full state visit.\nRead more from Sky News:Man hijacks plane and stabs passengers before being shot deadEvidence contradicts Israel's account of attack on aid workersGang war gripping major cities\n'Even more important'\nIt's possible the initial less formal presidential trip may still happen between now and September. Mr Trump is in Europe for the NATO summit in June and is due in Scotland to open a new golf course soon too.\n\"It is the second time it has happened to one person. The reason is we have two separate terms, and it's an honour to be a friend of King Charles and the family, William,\" the president said.\n\"I don't know how it can be bigger than the last one. The last one was incredible, but they say the next one will be even more important.\"\nHis last state visit in 2019, at the invitation of the late Queen, drew significant protests epitomised by the giant blow-up \"Baby Trump\" which floated over Parliament Square.\nBritain's trump card\nSeptember is a little earlier than had been expected for the visit. It may be an advantage for it to happen sooner rather than later, given the profoundly consequential and controversial nature of the first few months of his second term.\nThe decision by the British government to play its \"state visit trump card\" up front back in February drew some criticism.\nAnd since February, Mr Trump's position on numerous issues has been increasingly at odds with all of America's allies.\nOn Ukraine, he has seemingly aligned himself closely with Vladimir Putin. His tariffs have caused a global economic shock.

Sir Keir and his cabinet have been at pains not to be seen to criticise the president in any way as they seek to influence him on Ukraine and seek an elusive economic deal on tariffs.\nOn that tariff deal, despite some positive language from the US side and offers on the table, there has yet to be a breakthrough.

      "ml_hf_summary": "Donald Trump announced a full state visit to the United Kingdom in September, which will be his second such visit since becoming president.  The announcement came after a letter from King Charles III and an initial meeting between President Trump and the King was proposed in February.

This state visit comes amidst growing tensions between the US and its allies due to Trump's alignment with Vladimir Putin on Ukraine and his controversial trade policies.  The UK government has chosen not to retaliate against Trump's tariffs, opting for a diplomatic approach to influence him on key issues like Ukraine and economic deals.

      "content": "A highly anticipated resentencing hearing for convicted killers Erik and Lyle Menendez kicked off on Thursday before unravelling and being postponed by a judge.\nThe hearing was set to decide whether the brothers, serving life without the possibility of parole, should receive a new sentence that could allow their freedom after serving three decades in prison.\nThey were convicted in the 1989 killing of their parents in a Beverly Hills mansion - a case that continues to divide the nation.\nThe hearing devolved from the start as attorneys for the brothers fought with prosecutors, who oppose their release. The judge ultimately delayed the hearing until 9 May to weigh requests made by both sides.\nThe contentious hearing, which led to swarms of media, yielded few developments. \nThe brothers' attorney Mark Geragos declared he would seek the recusal of the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office from the case and prosecutors asked the court to review a new report about whether the brothers could be a danger to the public if released.\nThe judge is set to consider those requests at the May hearing date.\nThe resentencing bid is one of three paths the brothers' attorneys have been chasing to potentially secure a future release.\nThursday's developments muddled the timeline for any potential decision on the brothers' fate. \nThe hearing on Thursday was supposed to centre on one subject: Should the Menendez brothers be resentenced to a lesser penalty. \nThe day was set to include testimony from witnesses involved in the case and members of their family. There was even the possibility of the brothers taking the stand and pleading their case. \nMr Geragos has also asked Judge Michael Jesic of the Superior Court of Los Angeles to reduce their conviction to manslaughter, which could pave the way to a faster release.\nJudge Jesic will ultimately make the determination about whether to issue a new sentence or reject their request. He could also issue a different sentence that would make them eligible for parole.\nSeveral members of the Menendez family who support their release had travelled to Los Angeles to testify.\nThe brothers themselves appeared in court via a video feed from a San Diego prison, wearing identical cobalt blue prison uniforms.\nBut the hearing was derailed by a development in another bid they've been chasing for freedom: Clemency from California Gov Gavin Newsom.\nNewsom had ordered the state's parole board to examine the case, and that panel completed a risk assessment report this week. The report examines whether the brothers would be a risk to society if released. \nProsecutors said in court filings that they want to review the report before moving ahead with the resentencing effort. \nMr Geragos argued that he, too, had not been able to view the report yet. \nLate in the afternoon, Judge Michael Jesic agreed to pause the proceedings until 9 May to give the court and attorneys time to review the risk assessment. \nThat hearing will consider what parts of the report, if any, will be admissible during the resentencing hearing.\nThe court will also consider a motion Mr Geragos intends to file to recuse the district attorney's office from the case.\nMr Geragos and a lawyer representing the Menendez family members, Bryan Freedman, have accused Los Angeles County District Attorney Nathan Hochman of bias and violating the family's rights.\n\"This is a DA who made up his mind and did no hard work in terms of his position,\" Mr Geragos said after the hearing. He also accused several members of the prosecution of conflicts of interest.\nHochman, elected on a tough-on-crime platform, has fiercely opposed giving the brothers a reduced sentence. His predecessor initiated the resentencing process, and Hochman unsuccessfully tried to halt it from continuing. \nAt a press conference before the hearing, Hochman insisted the \"facts are not favourable\" to the Menendez brothers.\n\"If you don't have the law or the facts, pound the prosecutor, and that's what the defence strategy has been,\" he said.\nIn court, prosecutor Habib Balian said the Menendez brothers had committed \"extremely depraved conduct\" in the killings of Jose and Kitty Menendez.\nThe matter of resentencing rested on two factors, he said: whether the brothers had been rehabilitated since committing their crimes, and whether they still posed a risk of violence.\nTo decide the resentencing matter, \"we cannot close our eyes\" to the events that transpired over three decades ago, Mr Balian told the court.\nThe Menendez brothers have spent over 30 years in prison for murdering their parents with a series of shotgun blasts. \nLast year, the case received renewed attention following a Netflix drama and documentary about their case. \nIranian and US officials agree to continue with a third round of high-stakes talks on a new nuclear deal.\nThe wartime Alien Enemies Act has been controversially used to deport Venezuelans to a mega-jail in El Salvador.\nThe accused gang members are being sent to a notorious jail in El Salvador under a 19th-Century law.\nWhat is happening with US bonds, why Donald Trump cares and how ordinary Americans could be affected. \nThe US says the attack on the Red Sea coast aimed to restrict supplies and funds for the Houthis, who called it a war crime.\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

      "content": "Brothers had hoped resentencing hearing would pave way for immediate release - but judge orders pause until May\nThe Menendez brothers have spent years waiting for another day in court and a chance to prove that they should be freed after serving over three decades in prison for the 1989 slayings of their parents.\nThis week it appeared their time was perhaps finally coming - a judge was set to review their request for a resentencing and determine whether they have been rehabilitated. Their attorney, Mark Geragos, planned to ask the Los Angeles county judge Michael Jesic to reduce Erik and Lyle Menendez's charges to manslaughter, which would allow them to be released from prison immediately.\nBut as has often been the case in the brothers' decades-long fight for release, it was not so straightforward. After a tense day in court, the Los Angeles county judge Michael Jesic delayed the proceedings until next month in response to the disputes between the defense and prosecution.\n\"Today was a little bit disappointing for us as a family,\" Anamaria Baralt, the brothers' cousin told NBC Los Angeles outside the courthouse on Thursday. \"There have been some delays in this process that were unforeseeable, like the wildfires, that, of course, we have great patience for. This is another delay that is not so much, but we will continue to show up as a family.\"\nIn the last year, the brothers have had new hope for the possibility of their release after a wave of public support, as well as the former Los Angeles district attorney's announcement that he would recommend they be resentenced, and a decision from the governor to order the parole board to determine if they would pose a risk to the public if they were released.\nIn 1996, Erik, 54, and Lyle, 57, were convicted of first-degree murder in the shotgun killings of Jose Menendez, an entertainment executive, and Kitty Menendez. A judge sentenced them to life in prison without parole. The brothers said they feared their parents were going to kill them to cover up years of sexual, psychological and physical abuse they had suffered at the hands of their father. Prosecutors portrayed the brothers as wealthy young men who killed to obtain their multimillion-dollar inheritance, and have argued they were not abused.\nThey have recently sought freedom through multiple legal avenues, including by asking for a new trial in light of new evidence of their father's abuse, a petition for clemency from the governor, and a request for resentencing. And last year, for the first time since their convictions, it began to appear they could have a meaningful shot at freedom. A documentary and a popular - albeit controversial - Netflix series highlighted their stories and accounts of abuse and they received support from criminal justice reform advocates, including Kim Kardashian.\nGeorge Gascon, the progressive former Los Angeles county district attorney, recommended the brothers be resentenced to 50 years to life, which would have made them immediately eligible for release under California law. He said he believed the brothers were \"subjected to a tremendous amount\" of dysfunction and molestation, and argued they had paid their debt to society. He pointed to their behavior in prison where they have earned college degrees and served as mentors and caregivers.\nBut Gascon lost his seat to Nathan Hochman in November, and the new district attorney said he would not support resentencing and asked the court to rescind his predecessor's motion. He argued the brothers have not taken full responsibility for their crimes and his office has said it does not believe they were abused.\nThe brothers' family, the majority of whom support their release, have been highly critical of the new DA, and asked that he be removed from the case. They said he is \"incapable of handling this process with the fairness, care, or neutrality required by law\".\nThis week's hearing unfolded with the family in attendance as well as the brothers, who watched the proceedings via video from a state prison near San Diego.\nHochman's office had sought to delay this week's proceedings, which were postponed in January because of the Los Angeles wildfires, to allow the court to obtain part of the comprehensive risk assessments completed by the state parole board.\n\"If there is a report out there assessing the risk of violence, how do we not use it?\" Habib Balian, the deputy district attorney, said in court on Thursday.\nThe judge ultimately decided to postpone the proceedings to allow the prosecution and defense time to review the document, which the governor's office has said is not a stand-alone risk assessment. The hearing in May will also look at at a pending request from the brothers' attorney, Geragos, on whether the district attorneys office should be recused from the case.\nGeragos had denounced the district attorney for discussing the risk assessment report in a morning news conference. He said the DA's treatment of the case was \"appalling\" and he and and attorney Bryan Freedman, who represents Menendez relatives, were particularly critical of prosecutors' decision in a hearing last week to show, without warning, a graphic crime scene photo of Jose Menendez while relatives were present.\n\"That's not dignity,\" Freedman said. \"That's disrespect. That's harassment.\"\nBalian apologized for not warning the family about the image, but said: \"Erik and Lyle Menendez caused that carnage, not me.\"\nThe family has said the act \"retraumatized\" them and led to the hospitalization of Terry Baralt, Jose's sister, an 85-year-old with cancer who was in critical condition. \"This wasn't just cruel. It was a clear violation of our rights,\" the family said in a statement.\n\"Our forgiveness for Erik and Lyle does not erase our grief. It does not mean we don't mourn Jose and Kitty. It means we believe that people can grow. That trauma begets trauma,\" the statement continued. \"And yet this District Attorney's Office seems determined to punish us for that humanity.\"\nThe next hearing for the brothers is scheduled for 9 May.\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report",

      "content": "Wind power developer eyes legal remedies to order that blocks renewable energy projects and eliminates green job opportunities\nThis story was originally published by Inside Climate News and is reproduced here as part of the Climate Desk collaboration.\nThe buildout of renewable energy projects in downstate New York - the region that includes the Hudson valley and below - is often complicated. The space for these projects is limited, particularly in New York City, and they're often expensive.\nThough an approach of smaller battery storage and solar projects could inch the state closer to its ambitious renewable energy goals, it must be complemented by utility-scale renewable energy generation.\nThat's where Empire Wind 1, the first project in a massive buildout of offshore wind off the coast of Long Island, came in. The project, which was granted a lease from the federal government in 2017, promised to create more than 1,500 jobs and ultimately power 500,000 homes by building 54 wind turbines.\nOn Wednesday, the interior secretary, Doug Burgum, instructed the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management to halt all construction on the project \"until further review of information that suggests the Biden administration rushed through its approval without sufficient analysis\".\nSince taking office in January, Donald Trump has expressed strong opposition to offshore wind energy, saying he would not support \"big, ugly windmills\" that threaten wildlife. In February, his administration fired National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration employees who were monitoring the impacts of offshore wind projects on marine wildlife.\nOn his first day in office, the president signed an executive order that withdrew all parts of the outer continental shelf from new or renewed offshore leasing activity and suspended the approval process for all new onshore and offshore wind projects. The executive order also directed a review of all existing offshore leases, with termination possible.\nA spokesperson for Equinor, the Norwegian energy company behind Empire Wind 1, said construction will halt on the project. Empire Offshore Wind LLC, the limited liability company in charge of the project, is \"engaging with relevant authorities to clarify this matter and is considering its legal remedies, including appealing the order\", the spokesperson said in email.\nThe Trump administration's stop-work order could have important ramifications for New York state's climate goals and the growth of green job opportunities in the downstate region. About 44% of New York City's census tracts are home to low-income communities who have experienced a disproportionate amount of negative impacts from pollution.\nWhen climate targets are delayed, or entry-level job opportunities do not materialize, these communities are often the first to suffer.\nThe Empire Wind 1 project promised to bring green union jobs to the downstate region. Equinor is working to redevelop the marine terminal, which will house the project's long-term operations and maintenance base, in conjunction with the New York City Economic Development Corporation and the terminal operator Sustainable South Brooklyn Marine Terminal.\nThis is especially beneficial for the New York City neighborhood of Sunset Park, an environmentally overburdened community located near the South Brooklyn Marine Terminal, which fought to be included in the plans.\n\"Our community has fought for years to ensure that Sunset Park would be part of solutions to reduce carbon emissions, build healthier and green energy, and provide new local union jobs,\" said a statement from the office of council member Alexa Aviles, who represents the city district that encompasses Sunset Park.\nThese projects are slated to include at least 1,000 construction jobs, 130 apprentices, 200 assembly jobs at the marine terminal and 50 permanent, long-term jobs to keep the Empire Wind project up and running, according to the mayor's office.\nThe city has viewed green jobs as a pathway for low-income New Yorkers, or those without a college degree, to increase their earning potential. But as green job growth has slowed, big projects such as Empire Wind 1 have become even more important.\nSign up to Down to Earth\nThe planet's most important stories. Get all the week's environment news - the good, the bad and the essential\nafter newsletter promotion\n\"The reckless and overreaching move to halt construction that is already underway on Empire Wind threatens thousands of good union jobs and jeopardizes the progress New York has made toward cleaner, more affordable energy,\" wrote Vincent Alvarez, the president of the New York City Central Labor Council, in a statement.\nEsther Rosario, the executive director of the labor union coalition Climate Jobs NY, said that union tradesmen were slated to get on a vessel as early as next week for monopile installation, which drives the foundations of wind turbines into the seabed.\n\"That means that in two weeks, those workers won't have a paycheck coming their way,\" said Rosario.\nThe state's Climate Act established the target of a 70% renewably sourced grid by 2030.\nEarlier this year, Inside Climate News reported that this timeline is already likely to be delayed, and that the number of renewable projects planned for the New York downstate region is very small.\n\"We need to redouble our efforts at the state level, especially downstate, in getting new generation projects off the ground,\" said Alexander Patterson, the campaign coordinator for Public Power NY, which has been fighting for a more expansive buildout of renewable energy. \"This is just the latest in a long line of projects to be canceled, whether it's due to financial headwinds or inflation, and now political headwinds.\"\nThe halting of construction at Empire Wind 1 could lead to further delays for the state's energy transition. The Trump administration's stop-work order is also likely to sow uncertainty well beyond the downstate regions of New York.\n\"If we now have a situation where every change in administration could mean the revoking of permits and stop-work orders, I think it breaks the certainty that we have moving forward,\" said Rob Freudenberg, the vice-president of energy and environment programs at the Regional Plan Association, a civic organization that looks at how to improve the quality of life in the tristate area. \"That should reverberate beyond the offshore wind industry itself.\"",
      "ml_hf_summary": "The Trump administration's order halting construction on Empire Wind 1, an offshore wind project off Long Island, has significant implications for New York state's renewable energy goals and green job opportunities. The project was granted a lease in 2017 and promised to create over 1,500 jobs and power 500,000 homes. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum ordered the halt pending further review of the project's approval process. This action follows President Trump's opposition to offshore wind energy and his administration's withdrawal of leases for new projects. The project was expected to generate green union jobs in New York City's Sunset Park neighborhood, which has been advocating for its inclusion in climate solutions.  The halt could delay the state's transition to renewable energy sources and create uncertainty for future projects. \n"

Meloni said her objective for the trip was to invite Trump to meetings on behalf of Italy and Europe to foster a trade negotiation between the two states. \n\"I think the best way is that we simply speak frankly about the needs that every one of us has and find ourselves in the middle for that's useful for all,\" Meloni told reporters Thursday.\nMeanwhile, Vice President JD Vance met with Meloni Friday in Rome to continue discussing economic policies between the two countries. \nHere's what also happened this week: \nTrump kicked off the week meeting with El Salvador President Nayib Bukele Monday, launching a debate about whether El Salvador should return Maryland resident Kilmar Abrego-Garcia after he was deported there. \nOn Monday, Trump administration officials and Bukele agreed that they didn't have the authority to return Abrego-Garcia to the U.S., even though the Trump administration admitted in court filings that he was deported in an \"administrative error.\" Even so, the Trump administration has accused Abrego-Garcia of being a member of the MS-13 gang, a designated terrorist group. \nMeanwhile, the Supreme Court upheld in April a lower court's order that \"requires the government to 'facilitate' Abrego Garcia's release from custody in El Salvador and to ensure that his case is handled as it would have been had he not been improperly sent to El Salvador.\"\nPresident Donald Trump shakes hands with Nayib Bukele, El Salvador's president, during a meeting in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, April 14, 2025 (Al Drago for The Washington Post via Getty Images)\nWhile Attorney General Pam Bondi told reporters Monday that El Salvador would call the final shots on whether it would return Abrego-Garcia, Bukele said it was \"preposterous\" for El Salvador to do so. \n\"How can I smuggle a terrorist into the U.S.? I don't have the power to return him to the United States,\" Bukele said.\nAdditionally, the Justice Department unveiled documents Wednesday detailing domestic violence allegations that Abrego-Garcia's wife, Jennifer Vasquez, included in a court filing in 2021. Vasquez alleged in the filing that Garcia beat her and that she had documentation of the bruises he left on her.\nThe Trump administration also continued to go after federal funding at higher education institutions. \nAfter Harvard refused to comply with a series of requests from the Trump administration to reform various practices on campus, the administration revealed Monday that it would freeze more than $2 billion in federal funding for the institution.\nHarvard University President Alan M. Garber said in a Monday statement that the Trump administration included additional requests unrelated to tackling antisemitism on campus. As a result, Garber said the institution would not bend to those requests, claiming they were unconstitutional. \nWHITE HOUSE SLAMS IVY LEAGUE INSTITUTIONS FOR 'EGREGIOUS ILLEGAL BEHAVIOR' AMID TRUMP FEUD WITH HARVARD \nTrump has publicly criticized Harvard University multiple times in recent weeks. (Getty Images | iStock)\nGarber said the new requests \"direct governmental regulation of the 'intellectual conditions' at Harvard,\" including auditing viewpoints of student, faculty and staff members on campus, and eliminating all diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programs, offices and initiatives at Harvard. \n\"It makes clear that the intention is not to work with us to address antisemitism in a cooperative and constructive manner,\" Garber said. \"We have informed the administration through our legal counsel that we will not accept their proposed agreement.\"\nTrump also signed an executive order Tuesday seeking to combat soaring prescription drug prices. \nThe directive instructs Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to standardize Medicare payments for prescription drugs, including those used for cancer patients, no matter where a patient receives treatment. This could lower prices for patients by as much as 60%, according to a White House fact sheet.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nA new White House directive instructs Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s Department of Health and Human Services to standardize Medicare payments for prescription drugs. (iStock/Getty )\nThe order also includes a provision to match the Medicare payment for certain prescription drugs to the price that hospitals pay for those drugs. That amounts to up to 35% lower than what the government pays to acquire those medications, the White House said.\nDrug prices have significantly risen in recent years. Between January 2022 and January 2023, prescription drug prices rose more than 15% and reached an average of $590 per drug product, according to the Department of Health and Human Services. Of the 4,200 prescription drugs included on that list, 46% of the price increases exceeded the rate of inflation.\nDiana Stancy is a politics reporter with Fox News Digital covering the White House. \nGet the latest updates from the 2024 campaign trail, exclusive interviews and more Fox News politics content.\nBy entering your email and clicking the Subscribe button, you agree to the Fox News Privacy Policy and Terms of Use, and\n agree to receive content and promotional communications from Fox News.

Meloni visited Washington D.C. to meet with Trump and discuss economic policies. Meanwhile, Trump's administration faced controversy regarding the deportation of Kilmar Abrego-Garcia, who was mistakenly sent to El Salvador. The Supreme Court upheld a lower court order requiring his release from custody in El Salvador. Additionally, Trump froze over $2 billion in federal funding for Harvard University due to their refusal to comply with requests for campus reform.

      "summary": "There were two ghosts in the room during Canada's federal election debate - Justin Trudeau and Donald Trump.",
      "content": "The leaders of Canada's four major federal parties have squared off in their second and final debate ahead of this month's general election.\nBut it was someone off stage who stole much of the spotlight - US President Donald Trump.\nA big question heading into the two-hour forum was whether Liberal leader Mark Carney, who has been leading in the polls, would stumble.\nCarney, the former governor of the Bank of England, managed to survive Wednesday's French debate despite being less proficient in the country's second-most spoken language.\nOn Thursday, he found himself placed on the spot repeatedly by his three opponents: Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre, New Democratic Party leader Jagmeet Singh and Bloc Quebecois leader Yves-Francois Blanchet.\nHow to respond to Canada's ongoing trade war with the US was a theme, but the debate also saw clashes on affordability, crime and the environment.\nHere are five big takeaways from Thursday's primetime showdown:\nCarney's opponents were quick to focus on the mistakes of his unpopular predecessor, former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.\nConservative leader Poilievre made references to the \"lost Liberal decade\", talking about the last 10 years when the Liberal party has been in power. He cited issues like housing affordability and the high cost of living to drive his point home.\n\"How can we possibly believe that you are any different?\" Poilievre asked Carney.\nBlanchet also threw down the gauntlet to Carney. \"You claim you are different - you need to prove you are better.\"\nCarney was forced to defend himself multiple times, noting that he has only been in the prime minister's chair for one month despite sharing the same party banner as Trudeau.\n\"I am a very different person than Justin Trudeau,\" Carney said. \nThe leaders were asked about how they would negotiate with Trump and respond to his tariffs on Canada.\nThe US president has implemented blanket 25% tariffs on goods from Canada, with an exemption on products covered by the USMCA - a North American free trade deal. Canada is also hit with global US tariffs on steel and aluminium and cars.\nThe president has also publicly spoken about Canada becoming the 51st US state.\nCanada's government has previously said its position is to implement \"dollar-for-dollar\" tariffs with the aim of inflicting maximum pain on the US economy.\nBut during the debate, the leaders appeared to concede it is ultimately not an equal fight.\n\"We've moved on from dollar-for-dollar tariffs,\" Carney said, acknowledging that the US economy is more than 10 times the size of Canada's.\nThe Liberal leader said the focus would shift to targeted tariffs designed to maximise pain on the US and hurt Canada as little as possible.\nTrump appears to have softened his language on Canada in recent weeks. After a phone call with the US president in late March, Carney said Trump \"respected Canada's sovereignty\" and that their conversation was \"constructive\".\nCanada and the US are expected to start talks on trade and security after the 28 April election.\nFor Canadians tuned in to issues facing the country beyond Trump and his tariffs, the debate offered substantive policy discussions on topics from housing to crime to immigration.\nIt was clear that Canadians have starkly different choices before them.\nPoilievre frequently championed his vision of a small government that would keep taxes low to drive up economic growth and affordability for Canadians, and that would be tough on crime.\nSingh, meanwhile, pushed for stronger social programmes in Canada, including expanding the country's national dental care and pharmacare programmes and other healthcare spending.\nCarney stuck close to the centrist point of view of his party. \n\"Government can play a role, but its role has to be catalytic,\" he said during a segment on strong leadership in a crisis.\nCanada's political system, similar to that of the UK, has several political parties - the centrist Liberals, the right-leaning Conservatives, the left-leaning New Democrats, and the Bloc, which only runs candidates in Quebec. \nThere is also the Green Party, which was disqualified at the last minute from the debate for not running enough candidates.\nBut polls suggest that in this election, the bulk of Canadians are opting to support either the Conservatives or the Liberals.\nThis has left the third-place parties fighting for survival. National polls have Singh's New Democrats polling at 8.5% - which could roughly translate to just five seats out of 343, a major loss from their current 24 seats.\nSingh pushed to make his voice heard, repeatedly interrupting both Poilievre and Carney in a bid to set his party apart as the choice for left-wing voters.\n\"You can't entrust all the power to Mr Carney,\" Singh remarked. \nMeanwhile, Bloc leader Blanchet inserted issues relevant to the French-speaking province at every opportunity.\nHis party, too, stands to lose at least a dozen seats in Quebec, according to current polling.\nDespite the frequent crosstalk, the tone overall was rather cordial.\nThe general sense of decorum was apparent when the leaders were discussing the housing crisis. In a rebuttal to Poilievre, Carney appeared to stop himself before laying into his opponent.\n\"A misunderstanding... ,\" Carney said as he paused mid-sentence, adding: \"I'll be polite.\"\nEven after some heated exchanges, Carney and Poilievre were filmed shaking hands and laughing afterwards.\nNot only was it strikingly different to some recent presidential debate cycles in the US, it was even friendlier than some past Canadian federal debates.\nFrontrunner Mark Carney was tested in Wednesday's French-language debate, the first of two match-ups before the 28 April election.\nCanadian Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre is seeking to bring the Liberal Party's nine years in power to an end. \nThe former banker may not have been elected to office before, but is now seeking a mandate from Canadians. \nCanadians will vote on April 28. Here is a breakdown of who could be the country's next prime minister.\nCanada is holding a national election amid growing tension with the US over trade and tariffs.\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

      "ml_hf_summary": "Canada's four major federal party leaders participated in their final debate before the April 28th election.  Liberal leader Mark Carney faced scrutiny from his opponents, Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre, New Democratic Party leader Jagmeet Singh, and Bloc Québécois leader Yves-Francois Blanchet, who focused on past Liberal policies and trade tensions with the US under former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. The leaders discussed various policy issues including housing affordability, crime, and environmental protection.  US President Donald Trump's recent actions regarding tariffs on Canadian goods were a prominent topic of discussion. While the debate was largely cordial, there were moments of heated exchange between Poilievre and Carney, particularly concerning trade policies.  The election is expected to be close, with polls suggesting that Canadians will choose between the Conservatives or Liberals. \n"

      "summary": "Seven voters across the political spectrum took us into their thoughts after watching candidates debate.",
      "content": "Canada's election campaign has ramped into top gear with voting day just over a week away. \nThe leaders of major parties participated in debates on Wednesday (in French) and Thursday (in English), pitching their visions for the future of the country during an uncertain time. \nOn stage were Liberal leader Mark Carney, Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre, the NDP's Jagmeet Singh and the Bloc Quebecois leader Yves-Francois Blanchet. \nThe BBC has spoken to seven voters who watched Thursday's debate, as they work out who to cast their ballot for on 28 April. Responses have been edited for length and clarity.\nKim, 36, said she liked that the leaders focused on substance during the debate, and found Mark Carney to be a breath of fresh air. \nToday's debate was surprising in terms of the dynamic between the candidates. I think it was a bit more centred around content than blaming one another.\nI find it refreshing that Carney is not a career politician, and it showed in the debate. The way he spoke was business-like - in both the French and English debates - and he was able to express his points very clearly compared to practiced politicians.\nPierre Poilievre felt like a broken record, constantly looking at the camera to send his message. It was like watching an advertisement.\nMy values align with the NDP, but I don't think Singh can be a leader for the Canadians. So my vote is still for Carney, as I think he has the best plan.\nJohn, who is 64 and works in construction, was disappointed by the overall quality of the debate but said the Conservative leader was the clear winner.\nThe debate was all very respectful. I didn't get a sense that anyone was having a go at each other, unlike in the good old days of hot-headed debate - those days seem to be over.\nPierre Poilievre was the winner at the end of the day. I don't think there was a big difference between him and Carney, but Poilievre was better for sure.\nPoilievre made some good points, pointing to the nine-and-a-half years of the Liberals in power and the catastrophic mess they've made. Carney tried to pitch himself as some kind of Lancelot figure, but didn't come across as different to what was there before.\nAt the end of it, I was disappointed. I didn't feel anyone left the table with a phenomenal finish.\nThomas, 29, has lived in the UK and is voting in his first Canadian election.\nI think it was a pretty good debate, and nothing too crazy was said. The Liberal and Conservative leaders stayed on track, sticking to their initial messages. \nThe loser of the debate was Jagmeet Singh. He came across a bit desperate and frantic in the way he was trying to attack on multiple fronts. \nThe key thing that stood out for me was that all the leaders were emphasising a strong Canada in the face of foreign influence. \nMy big concerns were the environment, the cost of living and a strong Canada - they addressed those issues well, although I don't think anything new was brought up. \nOn the whole, the debate was civil, useful, and very Canadian.\n54-year-old Thierry said the debate highlighted the contrast in rhetoric between the Liberal and Conservative parties in Canada. \nPierre Poilievre showed a more prime ministerial attitude today, rather than being the attack dog he has been over the past few months.\nBut his pre-formatted spiel was very annoying - it was as if he was trying to beat it into voters that 10 years of Liberal government was bad for Canada. \nWe also saw a Mark Carney who was very confident, very respectful, quite the opposite of what the Conservative party has shown so far in mimicking the Republican party in the US in terms of rhetoric. \nThe standout moment was when Mark Carney told Poilievre that the carbon tax and Trudeau were \"both gone\" - to me that was akin to a smash that is unexpected in a tennis match. A highlight, and a very effective and honest response. \nLindsey, a 61-year-old retired civil servant, was impressed with the performance of Yves-Francois Blanchet. \nThis debate reinforced a few things, but didn't change anything. \nFrom a western Canadian perspective, the Bloc Quebecois leader had a few good comments. I liked that he said he was willing to work within the Canadian federation as long as Quebec's sovereignty is respected. It's not something we understand in western Canada. \nHe's not someone I'll be able to vote for, but I was impressed by his performance. \nThe 57-year-old university professor said the debate reinforced his feeling that Canada is in good hands whoever is elected. \nI'm personally confident that either Pierre Poilievre or Mark Carney are capable leaders, and I'm not worried about whether the wrong person wins.\nI'm more worried about the next year when the world might be on fire, as Trump seems prepared to make such extreme moves. Nothing is off the table with him.\nIf we go into a crisis, I'm sure Poilievre and Carney will put aside their differences and work together and do the job as well as it can be done.\nSo to the extent that Canada can be well prepared in the face of this looming threat, I'm confident that whoever the leader is is going to be able to manage it as well as it can be managed.\n41-year-old Adrienne said the debate showed off the strength of Canada's democracy, but hoped for more of a concrete discourse on climate policy. \nI am proud of the quality of the debate - it was respectful, dignified dialogue between high-calibre politicians. Canada has once again demonstrated to the world that it is a strong, multi-party democracy. \nMark Carney's idea of free trade in Canada by Canada day is a winning policy, and the concept of a national bureau to address the housing crisis - which was mentioned during the French debate - is one that should be explored. \nBut I found it difficult to relate to the picture that the Conservative leader was painting of the current Canadian experience in the sense that there is widespread chaos and crime.\nI wish there was more in the public discourse about the climate crisis and that leaders had to commit to climate action. I agree that Canada could be a clean energy superpower, but that they made no commitment was a little disappointing - which could have happened had the Green party been invited. \nIn the lead-up to election day, BBC Voter Voices is hearing from Canadians around the country about what matters to them.\nFrontrunner Mark Carney was tested in Wednesday's French-language debate, the first of two match-ups before the 28 April election.\nCanadian Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre is seeking to bring the Liberal Party's nine years in power to an end. \nThe former banker may not have been elected to office before, but is now seeking a mandate from Canadians. \nCanadians will vote on April 28. Here is a breakdown of who could be the country's next prime minister.\nCanada is holding a national election amid growing tension with the US over trade and tariffs.\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

      "summary": "As Trump threatens to walk from peace talks, a mineral deal looks unlikely to offer Ukraine security.",
      "content": "Ukraine started the day with, for once, the diplomatic wind in its sails.\nIt had finally agreed a mineral deal \"framework\" with Washington. An agreement that would see the US invest in Ukraine's recovery, in return for a share of the country's future profits from its natural resources, energy infrastructure and its oil and gas.\nThere had also been a first round of peace talks between American, European and Ukrainian officials in Paris, which had been hailed as \"positive\".\nThat was until both US President Donald Trump and his Secretary of State Marco Rubio threatened to pull out of brokering a ceasefire until progress appeared quickly.\nIt had been hoped by Ukraine that America's growing impatience with Russia would translate into further sanctions for Moscow. Instead, the threat of the US washing its hands of the ongoing peace efforts suits the Kremlin more than Kyiv.\nThe consensus is that the collective weight of Ukraine and its European allies would still be insufficient to counter Russian aggression in the long term. Despite continuing in its quest to conquer and occupy as much of Ukraine as possible, Moscow claims it is still striving for peace.\nWhat it has done is launch some of the deadliest missile strikes on civilians in recent days. In Kharkiv in the north-east, more than 100 people were wounded and one person was killed after three struck a residential part of the city.\nBut these attacks have not brought the slightest condemnation from the White House, which has continued to use more of a stick with Kyiv, by pausing military aid, and a carrot with Moscow, by improving relations, to get both sides to mirror its appetite for peace.\nKyiv agreed to a full ceasefire after the US paused its military aid and intelligence sharing. Moscow has not bent from its continued maximalist demands of more Ukrainian territory and the toppling of President Volodymyr Zelensky. It's hard to see how this threat will bring a breakthrough.\nOn the calm, open waters of the Black Sea, Mykhailo commands his US-made naval patrol ship. As we stand in the bridge, I ask him whether he feels he's fighting for Europe, as well as his country.\n\"If Russia occupies all of Ukraine, who knows?\" he replies. \"In 10 or 15 years' time, Russia will go to Poland, Lithuania, Estonia, any of the Baltic countries, that is quite clear.\"\nUS military aid for Ukraine is gradually going to run out. No more packages are going to be put before Congress or unlocked by presidential draw-down powers. \nShould Washington turn its back on these peace efforts, it would leave Ukraine reliant on its European allies to counter Russia's continued invasion. The consensus is that that collective weight would be insufficient in the long term.\nOn this stretch of Ukrainian-controlled coastline Kyiv has a success story. Through launching Western and domestically-produced drones, Russia's fleet has been forced back, and a major shipping lane has been restored.\nBut the problem for defending forces, as President Zelensky admits, is the battlefield realities being lost on a wider audience.\nDespite the US and Ukraine stepping closer to this mineral deal, the Trump administration's threat leaves it looking more like a business venture.\nIt also poses greater questions on whether Washington cares who controls Ukraine in the long term, as long as US commercial interests are protected.\nIranian and US officials agree to continue with a third round of high-stakes talks on a new nuclear deal.\nThe wartime Alien Enemies Act has been controversially used to deport Venezuelans to a mega-jail in El Salvador.\nThe accused gang members are being sent to a notorious jail in El Salvador under a 19th-Century law.\nWhat is happening with US bonds, why Donald Trump cares and how ordinary Americans could be affected. \nThe US says the attack on the Red Sea coast aimed to restrict supplies and funds for the Houthis, who called it a war crime.\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

However, US President Trump threatened to withdraw from brokering a ceasefire until progress is made, potentially hindering peace efforts. Despite this, Russia continues to attack civilians in Ukraine, including a recent incident in Kharkiv where over 100 people were injured. The US has paused military aid to Ukraine while simultaneously improving relations with Russia, creating a complex situation that leaves the future of Ukraine's defense uncertain.  The deal between the US and Ukraine is seen as more of a business venture than a genuine commitment to supporting Ukraine's long-term security. \n"

      "content": "Watch CBS News \n Updated on: April 18, 2025 / 8:01 PM EDT\n / CBS/AP \n Paris -- U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Friday that the U.S. may \"move on\" from trying to secure a Russia-Ukraine peace deal if there is no progress in the coming days. Months of efforts by the White House have failed to bring an end to the fighting, despite repeated promises by President Trump before he took office that he would use his skills as a negotiator to end the war immediately.\nRubio spoke in Paris after landmark talks among U.S., Ukrainian and European officials produced outlines for steps toward peace and appeared to make some long-awaited progress. A new meeting is expected next week in London, and Rubio suggested that could be decisive in determining whether the Trump administration continues its involvement.\n \"We are now reaching a point where we need to decide whether this is even possible or not,\" Rubio told reporters upon departure. \"Because if it's not, then I think we're just going to move on.\"\n \"It's not our war,\" Rubio said. \"We have other priorities to focus on.\" He said the U.S. administration wants to decide \"in a matter of days.\"\nHis remarks contrasted starkly with the stance of the Biden administration, during which then-Secretary of State Antony Blinken warned not long after the war began that Russia's autocratic President Vladimir Putin was determined \"to reconstitute the Soviet empire. Short of that, he'd like to reassert a sphere of influence around neighboring countries that were once part of the Soviet bloc. And short of that, he'd like to make sure that all of these countries are somehow neutral.\"\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has also warned, including in multiple interviews with CBS News, that Putin is intent on expanding Russia's borders by force -- and breaking the security bonds forged among Western democracies during World War II, of which the U.S.-led NATO alliance has been the most tangible.\n\"For him, we are a satellite of Russian Federation. At the moment, it's us, then Kazakhstan, then Baltic states, then Poland, then Germany. At least half of Germany,\" Zelenskyy told CBS News' Charlie D'Agata about one year ago. \"This aggression, and Putin's army, can come to Europe, and then the citizens of the United States, the soldiers of the United States, will have to protect Europe because they're the NATO members.\"\nZelenskyy called Russia's invasion a war \"against the democracy, against the values, against the whole world,\" acknowledging even then that some in the West might be tired of hearing that message, \"but only those are tired who are not at war, who don't know what war is, and who have never lost his or her children.\"\n\"If we do not stand firm, he will advance further,\" Zelenskyy reiterated in an interview with 60 Minutes just this month. \"It is not just idle speculation; the threat is real. Putin's ultimate goal is to revive the Russian empire and reclaim territories currently under NATO protection. Considering all of this, I believe it could escalate into a world war.\" \nRubio's comments on Friday came hours after the U.S. and Ukraine seemingly neared a long-delayed deal to grant U.S. access to Ukraine's vast mineral resources, which has been intertwined with President Trump's peace push. \n\"We have a minerals deal,'' Mr. Trump said Thursday, and Ukraine's economy minister said Friday that the two countries had signed a memorandum of intent ahead of a possible fuller agreement later.\n The deal, which Ukrainian Economy Minister Yuliia Svyrydenko said she signed with U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, is expected to pave the way for significant investments, infrastructure modernization and long-term cooperation.\n Work toward the mineral deal had stalled in February following a contentious Oval Office meeting between Mr. Trump, Vice President JD Vance, and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Negotiations have since resumed.\nDespite apparent growing U.S. impatience with the peace efforts, Rubio called Thursday's Paris talks constructive. \"Nobody rejected anything, nobody got up from the table or walked away.\"\n Rubio didn't single out Russia or Ukraine as blocking peace efforts. He said he informed Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov about the outlines that emerged when they spoke after the Paris talks, but wouldn't say how Lavrov reacted.\nWhen asked about Rubio's comments on Friday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters that \"fairly complex\" negotiations were ongoing between Russia and the U.S. He did not give details but said no direct talks between Mr. Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin were scheduled in the coming days.\n \"Russia is striving toward resolving this conflict, securing its own interests, and is open to dialogue. We are continuing to do this,\" he said.\nIn its readout on the call with Rubio, the Kremlin said Lavrov had confirmed Moscow's \"readiness to continue working together with American colleagues to reliably eliminate the root causes of the Ukrainian crisis.\" \nPutin and his deputies have consistently claimed those root causes are Zelenskyy's actions and NATO's eastward expansion -- misleading narratives that Mr. Trump himself has at times espoused about the full-scale invasion Putin launched on Feb. 24, 2022.\nAfter weeks of tension with European allies, Rubio told reporters in Paris that the European negotiators proved helpful. \"The U.K. and France and Germany can help us move the ball on this.\"\nDuring a meeting on Friday with Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni in Rome, Vice President JD Vance also spoke about the ongoing negotiations with Ukraine and Russia, saying he wouldn't \"pre-judge them, but we feel optimistic that we can hopefully bring this war, this very brutal war to a close.\"\nEuropean concerns are growing, however, about Mr. Trump's readiness to draw closer to Russia. These talks were the first time since his inauguration that top American, Ukrainian and European officials met to discuss an end to the war, which has posed the biggest security challenge to Europe since World War II.\n The meetings addressed hypothetical security guarantees for Ukraine in the future, but Rubio wouldn't discuss any possible U.S. role in that. Some kind of U.S. support for Ukraine is seen as crucial to ensuring that Russia would not attack again if and when a peace deal is reached.\n Rubio and presidential envoy Steve Witkoff have helped lead U.S. efforts to seek peace, and Witkoff has met three times with Putin, Rubio said. Several rounds of negotiations have been held in Saudi Arabia.\n Moscow has effectively refused to accept a comprehensive ceasefire that Mr. Trump has pushed and Ukraine has endorsed. Russia has made it conditional on a halt in Ukraine's mobilization efforts and Western arms supplies, which are demands rejected by Ukraine.\nRussia, meanwhile, has kept up a series of deadly strikes on Ukrainian cities, according to officials there, wounding scores of civilians days after missiles killed at least 34 during Palm Sunday celebrations in the northern city of Sumy.\n One person died and 103 others, including eight children, were wounded as Russia hit Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, early on Friday, its mayor Ihor Terekhov reported. He said cluster munitions struck a \"densely populated\" neighborhood four times.\nRussian drones also targeted a bakery in Sumy, less than a week after the deadly Palm Sunday strike there, killing a customer and wounding an employee, the regional prosecutor's office said. Photos released by the agency showed rows of Easter cakes stacked inside a devastated building, covered in thick dust, as a huge hole gaped in the wall behind them and rubble piled up on the floor.\n Last Sunday's strike on Sumy, resulting in mass casualties, was the second large-scale missile attack to claim civilian lives in just over a week. Some 20 people, including nine children, died on April 4 as missiles struck Zelenskyy's hometown of Kryvyi Rih. \n (c) 2025 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

The talks were held after months of failed attempts by the White House to bring an end to the fighting. While some progress was made in Paris, Russia has not accepted a comprehensive ceasefire proposed by former President Trump and Ukraine.  The U.S. is seeking to secure a deal that would include access to Ukraine's mineral resources as part of any peace agreement.

      "content": "Donald Trump has said the US will \"take a pass\" on brokering further Russia-Ukraine talks if Moscow or Kyiv \"make it very difficult\" to reach a peace deal. \nThe US president told reporters in the Oval Office on Friday that he was not expecting a truce to happen in \"a specific number of days\" but he wanted it done \"quickly\". \nHis comments came hours after US Secretary of State Marco Rubio warned that the US would abandon talks unless there were clear signs of progress within days.\n\"We're not going to continue with this endeavour for weeks and months on end,\" Rubio said, adding that the US had \"other priorities to focus on\".\nThis comes as Russian strikes on Ukraine continue, with two people reported killed and more than 100 injured in the north-eastern cities of Kharkiv and Sumy on Friday. \nMoscow launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, and Russian troops have been advancing - albeit slowly - in eastern Ukraine.\nPresident Vladimir Putin has placed a number of conditions on any potential ceasefire.\nTrump's direct diplomacy with Putin and sharp criticism of Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky have raised concern among Nato allies, who argue that support for Kyiv must be maintained.\nWhen asked about a deal between Russia and Ukraine on Friday, Trump said: \"We're talking about here people dying. We're going to get it stopped, ideally. \n\"Now if, for some reason, one of the two parties makes it very difficult, we're just going to say, 'you're fools, you're horrible people,' and we're going to just take a pass.\"\nDespite the Trump administration's initial confidence that it could secure a deal quickly, attempts to reach a full ceasefire have yet to materialise, with Washington blaming both sides.\nFollowing a meeting with European leaders in Paris about a potential ceasefire on Thursday, Rubio told reporters on Friday: \"We need to determine very quickly now - and I'm talking about a matter of days - whether or not this is doable.\"\n\"If it's not going to happen, then we're just going to move on,\" he said about truce talks.\nHe admitted that a peace deal would be difficult to strike.\nTrump had said before he re-entered office that he would stop the fighting in the first 24 hours of his presidency.\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, when asked to respond to Trump saying he expected an answer from Russia on a ceasefire, said \"the negotiations taking place are quite difficult\".\n\"The Russian side is striving to reach a peace settlement in this conflict, to ensure its own interests, and is open to dialogue,\" he said.\nDuring a meeting with Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni in Rome on Friday, US Vice-President JD Vance said he was still \"optimistic\" about ending the Ukraine war. \n\"I want to update the prime minister on some of the negotiations between Russia, Ukraine, and also some of the things that have happened even in the past 24 hours,\" he said.\n\"I won't prejudge them, but we do feel optimistic that we can hopefully bring this war - this very brutal war - to a close.\"\nVance's comments followed separate news that Ukraine and the US took the first step towards striking a minerals deal, after an initial agreement was derailed when a February meeting between Trump and President Zelensky erupted into a public shouting match.\nOn Thursday, the two countries signed a memorandum of intent on setting up an investment fund for Ukraine's reconstruction as part of an economic partnership agreement.\nThe aim is to finalise the deal by 26 April, the memo published by the Ukrainian government says.\nThe details of any deal remain unclear. Previous leaks have suggested the agreement has been extended beyond minerals to control of Ukraine's energy infrastructure, as well as its oil and gas.\nUkrainian negotiators have tried to resist Trump's demands that a joint investment fund would pay back the US for previous military aid, but have seemingly accepted his claim that it would help the country recover after the war ends. \nThe memo said the \"American people desire to invest alongside the Ukrainian people in a free, sovereign and secure Ukraine\".\nZelensky had been hoping to use the deal to secure a US security guarantee in the event of a ceasefire deal, telling European leaders last month that \"a ceasefire without security guarantees is dangerous for Ukraine\".\nThe US has so far resisted providing Kyiv with security guarantees.\nThe White House argues the mere presence of US businesses would put off Russia from further aggression, but that did not exactly work when they invaded in 2022.\nEconomy Minister Yulia Svyrydenko announced the signing of the memorandum on X, with pictures of Svyrydenko and US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent separately signing the document over an online call.\n\"There is a lot to do, but the current pace and significant progress give reason to expect that the document will be very beneficial for both countries,\" Svyrydenko wrote.\nBessent said the details were still being worked out but the deal is \"substantially what we'd agreed on previously.\" \nTrump hinted at the deal during a press conference with Meloni, saying \"we have a minerals deal which I guess is going to be signed on (next) Thursday... and I assume they're going to live up to the deal. So we'll see. But we have a deal on that\".\nIvanna Klympush-Tsintsadze, an MP and the chair of Ukraine's parliamentary committee on EU Integration, told the BBC the Ukrainian parliament would have \"the last word\" in the deal.\nShe added: \"I hope that there will be enough reasoning to ensure that whatever is signed, and if it is going to be ratified that it is in the interest of our country and our people\".\nOn Thursday, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha met Rubio and Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff in Paris to discuss how to end the war.\nSybiha said they had \"discussed the paths to a fair and lasting peace, including full ceasefire, multinational contingent, and security guarantees for Ukraine\".\nIranian and US officials agree to continue with a third round of high-stakes talks on a new nuclear deal.\nThe wartime Alien Enemies Act has been controversially used to deport Venezuelans to a mega-jail in El Salvador.\nThe accused gang members are being sent to a notorious jail in El Salvador under a 19th-Century law.\nWhat is happening with US bonds, why Donald Trump cares and how ordinary Americans could be affected. \nThe US says the attack on the Red Sea coast aimed to restrict supplies and funds for the Houthis, who called it a war crime.\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

He said he expected Ukraine to follow suit and said this would be a test of whether the \"regime\" in Kyiv was interested in peace.\nPutin's made his remarks in a meeting with Russia's commander-in-chief Valery Gerasimov, which was broadcast on state television. Ukrainians reacted sceptically, pointing out the announcement was made at the same time as an air raid alert sounded across the Kyiv region.\nRussia has broken numerous ceasefire since its 2014 covert invasion of eastern Ukraine. Unlike Ukraine, it has refused to implement a 30-day pause in fighting proposed more than a month ago by the Trump administration.\nSpeaking on Saturday, Putin said Kyiv was guilty of violating a deal \"100 times\" to refrain from attacking Russian energy infrastructure. He commanded Gerasimov to prepare an \"immediate response\" if this were to happen again.\nRead the full story here:\nRussia and Ukraine swapped hundreds of prisoners in the war's largest exchange, according to Russia's Ministry of Defense.\nPresident Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Ukraine returned home 277 prisoners of war as part of the swap mediated by the UAE. He posted:\nIn total, since the beginning of the full-scale war, 4,552 people--both warriors and civilians--have been successfully brought back home from Russian imprisonment.\nWe remember all those who remain in captivity. We are searching for everyone who could be there. We must bring them all home.\nIt is approaching 6pm in Kyiv and Moscow. Here is a summary of the updates so far from today's live blog:\nRussian president Vladimir Putin on Saturday announced an Easter truce in the conflict in Ukraine starting this evening and lasting till midnight on Sunday. \"Today from 1800 (1500 GMT) to midnight Sunday (2100 GMT Sunday), the Russian side announces an Easter truce,\" Putin said in televised comments, while speaking to Russian chief of staff Valery Gerasimov. Putin said he assumed Ukraine would follow Russia's example, but told Gerasimov, to ready Russian troops to repel any violations of the truce by Kyiv.\nPresident Donald Trump has said negotiations between Ukraine and Russia are \"coming to a head\" and insisted that neither side is \"playing\" him in his push to end the grinding war. Trump spoke on Friday shortly after secretary of state Marco Rubio warned that the US may \"move on\" from trying to secure a Russia-Ukraine peace deal if there is no progress in the coming days, after months of efforts have failed to bring an end to the fighting.\nUS vice-president JD Vance met on Saturday with the Vatican's secretary of state, Cardinal Pietro Parolin, and the foreign minister, archbishop Paul Gallagher. As the US pushes to end the war in Ukraine, Parolin reaffirmed Kyiv's right to its territorial integrity and insisted that any peace deal must not be \"imposed\" on Ukraine but \"is built patiently, day by day, with dialogue and mutual respect\".\nAt least six people have been injured by Russian attacks across Ukraine over the past day, local authorities said on Saturday, according to the Kyiv Independent. Citing the Ukrainian air force, the publication reported that Russia deployed eight missiles of different types, and 87 long-range drones. Of those, 33 were shot down and 36 turned out to be decoy, the air force said. The overnight attack caused damage in five regions across the country, the Ukrainian air force said.\nRussia's defence ministry accused Ukraine on Saturday of attacking Russian energy facilities 10 times over the past 24 hours. A 30-day moratorium was brokered by the US in March between Ukraine and Russia against strikes on each other's energy infrastructure. However, both nations have repeatedly accused the other of violating it.\nOn Saturday, a Ukrainian drone strike on a car in the Kursk region killed a woman and injured a man and a child, regional governor Alexander Khinstein said on Telegram.\nRussia on Saturday said it had retaken the penultimate village still under Ukrainian control in its Kursk frontier region, where Kyiv's forces launched a surprise offensive in August. \"During offensive operations, units of the Northern Group of Troops liberated the village of Oleshnya,\" the Russian defence ministry said on Telegram. \"In the areas of the Kursk region where Ukraine armed force mounted an incursion, the main part of the territory ... is now liberated. That's 1,260 square kilometres, 99.5 percent,\" Gerasimov told Putin in a televised meeting. The Guardian has been unable to independently verify the reports.\nPosting on X on Saturday, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy said \"our forces continued their activity on the territory of the Kursk region and are holding their positions\". He added: \"In the Belgorod region, our warriors have advanced and expanded our zone of control.\"\nRussian troops are \"solidifying their presence\" in the village of Kalynove in the Donetsk region, the Kyiv Independent reported, citing the DeepState military blog, which is considered close to Ukraine's army. The publication reports, sourcing DeepState, that Russian forces are deploying infantry, and establishing logistical routes and communication lines in Kalynove.\nThe US is prepared to recognise Russian control of the Ukrainian region of Crimea as part of a broader peace agreement between Moscow and Kyiv, Bloomberg News has reported, citing people familiar with the matter. According to Bloomberg, the people said a final decision on the matter had not yet been taken, and the White House and state department did not respond to a request for comment.\nUS congressman Brian Fitzpatrick, a pro-Ukraine Republican representing Pennsylvania, signed an artillery shell with a message intended for Vladimir Putin during a visit with Ukrainian troops yesterday after a meeting with president Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Fitzpatrick was filmed signing an artillery shell with a message that read: \"To: Putin, From: PA-1. #PeaceThroughStrength.\"\nAustralia will use \"whatever avenues\" it can to help Melbourne man Oscar Jenkins, who faces a 15-year jail term in Russia for fighting with Ukrainian troops. The prime minister said on Saturday that the government would \"continue to make representations to the reprehensible regime of Vladimir Putin\" to release Jenkins, 33, a former teacher who fought with Ukraine's armed forces against Russia's invasion.\nRussia and Ukraine will conduct a new prisoner swap on Saturday mediated by the United Arab Emirates, a source close to the negotiations told Reuters. Nearly 500 Russian and Ukrainian prisoners and 46 injured soldiers will be exchanged in the latest swap to be mediated by Abu Dhabi. The exchange will involve 246 prisoners from each side, the source said.\nAlthough Volodymyr Zelenskyy is yet to respond to Russian president Vladimir Putin's announcement of a temporary Easter ceasefire, the Ukrainian president has just posted an update on X about the Kursk region.\nZelenskyy said Ukrainian troops were \"holding their positions\". He wrote:\nI have just received a report from commander-in-chief Oleksandr Syrskyi.\nToday, our forces continued their activity on the territory of the Kursk region and are holding their positions. In the Belgorod region, our warriors have advanced and expanded our zone of control.\nAs for yet another attempt by Putin to play with human lives-at this moment, air raid alerts are spreading across Ukraine. At 17:15, Russian attack drones were detected in our skies. Ukrainian air defense and aviation have already begun working to protect us. Shahed drones in our skies reveal Putin's true attitude toward Easter and toward human life.\nHere is what Vladimir Putin said about the temporary Easter ceasefire on Saturday, as reported by the Associated Press (AP):\nGuided by humanitarian considerations, today from 18:00 00:00 from Sunday to Monday, the Russian side declares an Easter truce. I order that all military actions be stopped for this period.\nWe assume that the Ukrainian side will follow our example. At the same time, our troops must be ready to repel possible violations of the truce and provocations from the enemy, any of its aggressive actions.\nRussia's military chief of staff Valery Gerasimov on Saturday said troops had retaken more than 99% of territory seized by Ukraine in the Kursk region in an incursion launched in August.\n\"In the areas of the Kursk region where Ukraine armed force mounted an incursion, the main part of the territory ... is now liberated.

I encourage all my colleagues in Congress to come here.\nRussia's defence ministry accused Ukraine on Saturday of attacking Russian energy facilities 10 times over the past 24 hours, Reuters reports.\nA 30-day moratorium was brokered by the US in March between Ukraine and Russia against strikes on each other's energy infrastructure. However, both nations have repeatedly accused the other of violating it.\nOn Friday, when asked if the energy moratorium was over, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said that no orders from Vladimir Putin had been received to alter Russia's position.\nThe posters are going up all over Hungary. \"Let's not allow them to decide for us,\" runs the slogan alongside three classic villains of Hungarian government propaganda.\nThey are: Ukraine's wartime leader, Volodymyr Zelenskyy; the European Commission's president, Ursula von der Leyen; and Manfred Weber, the German politician who leads the centre-right European People's party in the European parliament, which counts Hungary's most potent opposition politician among its ranks.\nThat decision is Ukraine's membership of the EU, a distant prospect not in the gift of any of the politicians now plastered across billboards in Hungary. Ballot papers, being sent out this week, ask a simple question: \"Do you support Ukraine becoming a member of the EU?\"\nDespite the neutral question, Hungary's government is not standing on the sidelines. After the launch of the campaign, the prime minister, Viktor Orban, last week urged people to vote, claiming that Ukrainian membership would mean \"we would have to spend all Hungary's money on Ukraine\".\nThe government has also claimed - without offering evidence - that \"cheap labour\" from Ukraine would take jobs from Hungarians, while epidemics would spread because not enough Ukrainians have vaccinations.\nThe governing Fidesz party realised that \"there is a sentiment against Hungary's involvement in the war\", said Laszlo Andor, Hungary's EU commissioner from 2010 to 2014. \"But ever since, this has been used and abused to deny proper support to Ukraine.\"\nHungary has repeatedly sought to block EU sanctions against Russia, eventually backing down. It has vetoed the release of EUR6bn funds to reimburse other EU countries providing military aid to Ukraine and flatly refused to sign two EU declarations in support of its invaded neighbour.\nBut now its attempts to stymie EU support for Ukraine could force a reckoning in its relations with the bloc, at a moment when Orban contends with his most serious political challenger in years.\nOn Saturday, a Ukrainian drone strike on a car in the Kursk region killed a woman and injured a man and a child, regional governor Alexander Khinstein said on Telegram.\nRussia on Saturday said it had retaken the penultimate village still under Ukrainian control in its Kursk frontier region, where Kyiv's forces launched a surprise offensive in August, reports Agence France-Presse (AFP).\nThe Ukrainian campaign took Russian troops by surprise and resulted in Kyiv seizing more than 1,000 square kilometres (400 square miles) of territory.\n\"During offensive operations, units of the Northern Group of Troops liberated the village of Oleshnya,\" the Russian defence ministry said on Telegram.\nNow only one other village, Gornal, remains under Ukrainian control, reports AFP.\nRussian soldiers recaptured large swathes of the region in March, notably driving the Ukrainians out of the small town of Sudja, their main base of operations in the area.\nAccording to AFP, Russian troops are now at the border and are poised to beef up threats to the Ukrainian region of Sumy, which faces Kursk, where they have already carried out incursions in recent weeks.\nThe US president, Donald Trump, said that nobody was \"playing\" him over negotiations to end Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Trump added that he believed both Russia and Ukraine were still showing enthusiasm to bring the war to an end.\nYou can listen to Trump's comments in this video report:",

      "content": "Trump said he could stop war in 24 hours, but team appears daunted by negotiation with 'a lot of detail attached to it'\nOne key to a successful negotiation is always being willing to walk away from the table. But it isn't clear whether the Trump administration has threatened to give up on a Russia-Ukraine peace deal as a negotiating tactic or simply because it lacks the concentration for a complicated negotiation - a shortcoming that has dogged the administration's foreign policy through its first three months in office.\nStanding on a tarmac in Paris, the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, issued a threat that the US could simply \"move on\" from mediating the biggest military conflict in Europe since the second world war. That would be the latest about-face for an administration that has already taken a back seat on negotiating a peace in Gaza and retreated on implementing worldwide tariffs that shook financial markets around the globe earlier this month.\nDiplomacy, it turns out, is hard. The 24 hours that Donald Trump promised he would need to halt the fighting in Ukraine have long since passed. And the administration has done little of the hard diplomatic work that was required to secure landmark deals like the Dayton agreement or the Camp David accords in the past.\nThere have been plenty of meetings: Trump's envoy Steve Witkoff has spoken three times with Vladimir Putin, during which he has listened to the Kremlin leader's thoughts on Ukraine for hours, and Rubio was on the phone with Sergei Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister, and met with Ukrainian officials and European leaders in Paris on Thursday.\nBut there are few indications that new ground has been struck, that the US has exerted any pressure on the Kremlin or that the negotiations have identified what kinds of security guarantees would exist to ensure that Russia wouldn't simply continue the war when it sees fit. One element of a \"Trump deal\" appears to be this: that it doesn't take very long or involve very much effort to achieve.\n\"We're not going to continue to fly all over the world and do meeting after meeting after meeting if no progress is being made,\" Rubio said, noting that the US wanted to stop \"thousands\" of people from dying in the next year. \"So if they're serious about peace - either side, or both - we want to help. If it's not going to happen, then we're just going to move on. We're going to move on to other topics that are equally if not more important in some ways to the United States.\"\nRubio clearly wished to vent frustration on Friday, a day after Trump had said in the White House that he was waiting for Russia's response to the proposed framework for a peace deal and expected to have it this week. The White House appears to be increasingly frustrated with Moscow, something that both European and Ukrainian officials had hoped would take place.\nBut if Trump walks away from a deal and the war altogether, the decision will still play into Putin's hands - relieving Ukraine of a key ally and financial backer in its fight against Russia. Moscow appears to see the situation as a win-win: either taking a favourable deal with the White House or waiting for Trump to lose patience. Which he is now threatening to do.\nThere are more hopeful voices in the administration. JD Vance, the Ukraine-sceptic vice-president, told Italy's prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, on Friday that he felt \"optimistic that we can hopefully bring this war, this very brutal war, to a close\". There had been \"some things ... even in the past 24 hours\" that he said could indicate a chance to secure a ceasefire.\nBut to listen to Rubio or Witkoff, the various sides have barely moved from their opening positions. On Friday, Bloomberg reported that the United States had offered Russia some sanctions relief in exchange for a deal - something that Rubio had offered as far back as his confirmation hearings in January. And Witkoff appeared surprised on Fox News that Russia wanted \"so much more\" than just a ceasefire. \"I mean, it's just a lot of detail attached to it,\" he said. \"It's a complicated situation from, you know - rooted in some real problematic things happening between the two countries.\"\nThere was always an expertise gap in the difficult negotiations over a ceasefire to the Russian war in Ukraine. Now the administration appears to have a patience gap and has signaled it is ready to walk away. Ukraine does not have that option.",
      "ml_hf_summary": "The US administration's efforts to negotiate a peace deal in the Russia-Ukraine conflict are facing challenges. Despite President Trump's initial promise of halting the fighting within 24 hours, negotiations have stalled due to complex details and lack of progress. Secretary of State Marco Rubio has expressed frustration with the slow pace of diplomacy, suggesting the US may \"move on\" if no significant breakthroughs occur.  While Vice-President JD Vance expresses optimism for a ceasefire, officials like Steve Witkoff highlight the complexity of the situation and Russia's demands for substantial concessions. The potential outcome is unclear, as both sides appear to be strategically maneuvering in this complex geopolitical conflict. \n"

      "ml_hf_summary": "Donald Trump initiated peace talks between Russia and Ukraine two months ago, aiming for a swift resolution. Despite multiple meetings and attempts at ceasefire agreements, progress has been minimal. A 30-day ceasefire on energy infrastructure was never implemented, and a maritime ceasefire in the Black Sea remains unfulfilled due to Russia's demand for sanctions relief.  Marco Rubio's criticism highlights growing frustration within Washington regarding the lack of tangible results. While Trump initially hoped for an early victory, his approach has been criticized as lacking firmness against Putin, with Moscow seemingly compartmentalizing their relationship with the US from the ongoing war. \n"

But he echoed Rubio in saying, \"if for some reason, one of the two parties makes it very difficult, we're just going to say, you're foolish . . . we're going to just take a pass.\" \nThe statements follow a day-long meeting in Paris on Thursday hosted by Emmanuel Macron, president of France, that was attended by a US delegation, including Rubio and special envoy Steve Witkoff, alongside officials from Ukraine, UK and Germany.\n\"We're not going to continue to fly all over the world and do meeting after meeting after meeting if no progress is being made,\" Rubio said.

Kyiv has said since it is open to a temporary ceasefire, but Russia has delayed.\nRubio said: \"If both sides are serious, then we want to help, but if it's not going to happen, then we're just going to move on to other topics that are equally if not more important for the US.\"\nDmitry Peskov, the Kremlin's spokesperson, on Friday said there had been \"progress\" in talks but \"many difficult discussions still lie ahead\".\nUkraine on Thursday said it had signed a preliminary agreement with the US over sharing its mineral and energy resources, which has been a key demand from Trump, who sees it as a way to pay back the US for billions of dollars in military aid. \nSuch an accord had been close to being signed in February but was derailed by an argument between Trump and Zelenskyy in the Oval Office.\nRecommended\nRubio said the talks in Paris were \"very positive\" and the involvement of European countries had been constructive. \nAnother meeting in a similar format will be held next week in London to allow the US to get Russian input and for Ukraine to decide on its positions.\nA French official said Thursday's gathering was significant because it began \"a new positive process\" in peace talks that this time had more involvement from European countries. \nThe talks were the first high-level, in-person talks in the US's efforts that have included European powers directly. A British official also said the discussion felt significant regarding the US getting to the same position as Europeans on Putin's lack of commitment to peace plans.\n\"The UK, France and Germany can help us move the ball on this and get this closer to a resolution,\" Rubio said.\nRubio declined to describe the framework that the US has put on the table at this stage. He added it was too early to make definitive decisions on security guarantees, although they had been discussed. \nUkraine has pushed hard for such guarantees, especially regarding its ability to maintain and build up a strong army to defend itself, and its European allies have also emphasised their importance.

      "content": "Stefania Palma in Washington and Hannah Murphy in San Francisco\nPublishedApril 18 2025\nRoula Khalaf, Editor of the FT, selects her favourite stories in this weekly newsletter.\nA critical part of Mark Zuckerberg's defence in the most serious antitrust challenge in Meta's history this week had little to do with the technology giant and much to do with TikTok. \nIn testimony across three days, the billionaire tech founder repeatedly told a US federal court in Washington that the video platform owned by Chinese parent ByteDance had grown to become a tremendous competitor. \nThe plaudits of his rival had a goal: quashing US Federal Trade Commission allegations that Meta retained an illegal monopoly, charges that, if proven, could potentially have more far-reaching consequences for Zuckerberg's business than any commercial threat it faces. \nLose the case, and Meta could be forced to break up its $1.5tn group and spin off its Instagram and WhatsApp apps -- an outcome Zuckerberg has previously vowed to \"go to the mat and fight\". Win, and it will have scored a decisive victory over a regulator that has long had Big Tech in its sights, more recently suing retail giant Amazon.\nThe trial comes after Zuckerberg failed to negotiate away the proceedings in the first place. According to a person familiar with the matter, the FTC had demanded $30bn as a potential settlement; Meta lowballed at $450mn then raised its proposal to $1bn after the regulator had set a floor of $18bn. The parties then decided to move to court.\nAt the heart of the FTC suit is an allegation that Meta employed a \"systematic strategy\" to eliminate competitors, including by acquiring rivals Instagram and WhatsApp in 2012 and 2014 for $1bn and $19bn respectively.\nFTC lawyers this week presented evidence of Zuckerberg seeing these nascent applications as a threat, including a host of uncomfortable emails. Zuckerberg in 2012 agreed to suggestions that the Instagram deal might help \"neutralise a competitor\" and also said he wanted Meta to \"use M&A to build a competitive moat around us on mobile and ads\". \nBut such tactics would only potentially be deemed illegal if the FTC can first prove that Meta retains a monopoly, an argument some antitrust experts say will be harder to stack up. It is a point Zuckerberg and former Meta chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg have focused on in their testimonies, stressing TikTok's explosive growth to serve more than 1bn users globally. \n\"What they said and thought in the past is not a great look but it does not have much probative value -- if any -- for whether Meta maintains a monopoly now,\" said Paul Swanson, head of the antitrust and competition practice at Holland & Hart. \n\"Zuckerberg and Sandberg did a good job explaining why that is a current reality -- [that] TikTok and Meta do have attrition from each other and are substitutes for each other in most users' minds.\"\nIn antitrust challenges, the FTC must also prove there has been consumer harm, which typically would be a monopolist driving up prices. With Meta offering its services for free, the agency is instead arguing that consumers suffered a degraded user experience due to the platform's dominance -- feeds filled with adverts and poor privacy protections. \nThe key challenge for the FTC will be convincing James Boasberg, the presiding judge, that Meta has dominated -- in part via acquisitions -- a \"personal social-networking\" market focused on friends-and-family connections, which does not include TikTok or Google's YouTube. \nA person close to the earlier settlement negotiations, which were first reported by the Wall Street Journal, said that Meta's lowball offer showed how weak it considered the FTC's case to be. The FTC declined to comment. \n\"We haven't been shy about explaining why it doesn't make sense for the FTC to bring a case to trial that requires it to prove something every 17-year-old in America knows is absurd -- that Instagram doesn't compete with TikTok. We are prepared to win at trial,\" Meta spokesperson Dani Lever said in a statement. \nBut some experts argue that Boasberg, who has uttered few words all week, may be receptive to the FTC's arguments. \n\"The court is clearly open to the possibility that there is a personal social networking market,\" said Kenneth Dintzer, partner in the antitrust and competition group at Crowell & Moring. He referenced a 2024 filing in which Boasberg said the FTC had \"met its burden to show that other applications are not reasonable substitutes\" for friends-and-family sharing.\nZuckerberg rejected this notion in court, pointing to the group rushing to develop Reels -- short-form videos -- in response to TikTok's meteoric rise. TikTok's offering had \"probably [been] the highest competitive threat against Instagram and Facebook in the last few years\", Zuckerberg said. \nThe Meta boss also argued WhatsApp and Instagram had been acquired to accelerate their growth, pointing to the dramatic jump in users following the deals. \nThe FTC countered with a 2013 email, in which Zuckerberg argued ahead of the WhatsApp deal that \"the biggest competitive vector for us is for some company to build out a messaging app for communicating with small groups of people, and then transform that into a broader social network\". \nAfter offering to teach Sandberg the board game The Settlers of Catan, Zuckerberg said in a 2012 email: \"[Facebook] Messenger isn't beating WhatsApp, Instagram was growing so much faster than us that we had to buy them for $1 billion . . . That's not exactly killing it.\"\n\"The confounding part of Mark's testimony is that he's trying to contradict statements today that he made a decade ago as these acquisitions were being contemplated in real time,\" said Lee Hepner, senior legal counsel for the anti-monopoly non-profit American Economic Liberties Project. \nPerhaps the most striking evidence came in the form of a Zuckerberg email in 2018, where he considered spinning off Instagram -- citing exactly the kind of threat from antitrust enforcement he faces today. \nAs \"calls to break up the big tech companies grow\", he wrote, \"there is a non-trivial chance that we will be forced to spin out Instagram and perhaps WhatsApp in the next five to 10 years\". \nComments have not been enabled for this article.",
      "ml_hf_summary": "Meta Platforms CEO Mark Zuckerberg testified in a US federal court regarding antitrust allegations of maintaining an illegal monopoly. The FTC alleges Meta's acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp, along with its dominance in social networking, constitute anti-competitive behavior. Zuckerberg countered by emphasizing TikTok's growing competition as evidence against the FTC's claims.  The trial focuses on whether Meta has maintained a monopoly and if consumer harm occurred due to its dominance. The FTC argues that Meta's actions have degraded user experience through advertising and privacy concerns, while Meta emphasizes the competitive threat posed by TikTok and the strategic acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp for growth. The outcome could result in Meta breaking up into separate entities or facing significant fines. \n"

      "content": "Chancellor supports economic ties with Beijing as she prepares to fly to US next week for trade deal talks\nRachel Reeves has dismissed the idea of economically disengaging from China, amid concerns the US may put pressure on the UK to limit its deals with Beijing.\nThe chancellor, who will discuss a trade deal with the US on a trip to Washington next week, said it would be \"very foolish\" for Britain to have less involvement with Xi Jinping's administration.\nThe Wall Street Journal reported this week that US officials would attempt to use trade deals and tariff discussions to economically isolate China.\nKeir Starmer spoke to Donald Trump on Friday about the \"ongoing and productive discussions\" over a trade deal. It was the first conversation between the British prime minister and the US president since the imposition of 10% tariffs by Washington.\nReeves told the Daily Telegraph: \"Well, China is the second biggest economy in the world, and it would be, I think, very foolish to not engage. That's the approach of this government.\"\nShe also said she supported the fast-fashion company Shein floating on the London Stock Exchange. Shein was founded in China, but is now based in Singapore.\nThe company has faced allegations of supply chain and labour abuses.\nReeves's comments came a week after the government was granted emergency powers by parliament to continue operations at the British Steel plant in Scunthorpe, owned by the Chinese company Jingye.\nJingye was accused of not ordering enough supplies to keep the blast furnaces at the site in north Lincolnshire running, leading to a race against time to stop the furnaces cooling.\nMPs had criticised potential links between Jingye and the Chinese government, leading to questions over whether Chinese companies would be allowed to invest in critical infrastructure in the UK.\nThe business secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, said the companies would be looked at in \"a different way\" to those from other countries in regard to the steel industry, but refused to rule out Chinese investment in other sectors.\nThe Chinese embassy in London criticised some MPs for \"anti-China\" rhetoric, and an \"arrogance, ignorance and twisted mindset\" towards the country.\nReeves told the Telegraph that Chinese investment would be blocked from sensitive areas of critical national infrastructure.\nShe said she was open to Shein being listed on the London Stock Exchange, as it and the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) had \"very strict standards\".\nShein filed with the FCA in June last year for an initial public offering that could be worth PS50bn. However, the FCA has taken longer than usual to approve it, amid concerns over its supply chain.\nThe campaign group Stop Uyghur Genocide sent a dossier to the FCA in August alleging that Shein used cotton from China's Xinjiang region.\nReeves said: \"We have lost business and we have lost companies in recent years and we're working closely with the London Stock Exchange to make the UK a more vibrant place to list.\"\nReeves will hold talks with US officials, including the US treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, during her visit next week to attend the International Monetary Fund's spring meetings with other finance ministers.\nIt is hoped that tariff reductions could be agreed within weeks or months.\nStarmer told Trump of his \"commitment to free and open trade and the importance of protecting the national interest\" in their 35-minute call on Friday.\nBritish officials have presented a draft deal to their US counterparts that includes reductions to tariffs on steel, aluminium and cars.\nSources say it does not cover pharmaceuticals, however. Trump has said he will announce tariffs for the sector \"very shortly\", in a move that could cost British drug companies billions of pounds in revenue.",
      "ml_hf_summary": "Chancellor Rachel Reeves stated her support for continued economic engagement with China despite concerns about US pressure to limit trade ties. She emphasized the importance of maintaining involvement with China's economy, citing its status as the second-largest globally.  Reeves also expressed openness to Shein listing on the London Stock Exchange, provided it meets strict standards and addresses supply chain concerns. The UK government has granted emergency powers to Jingye for operations at the British Steel plant in Scunthorpe, while Chinese investment in critical infrastructure remains under scrutiny. A trade deal between the US and UK is being negotiated, with potential tariff reductions on steel, aluminum, and cars expected within weeks or months.  \n"

      "content": "NASUWT conference votes to launch strike ballot if spending review does not top up school budgets in full\nA second teaching union in England has vowed to strike if the government fails to compensate schools in full for next year's teachers' pay award.\nThe NASUWT union's annual conference voted to reject any pay offer from the government that did not top up school budgets in June's spending review, and to \"move immediately to ballot members for industrial action\".\nThe vote means the NASUWT and the National Education Union (NEU), which together represent the bulk of England's teaching workforce, are poised to strike if Bridget Phillipson, the education secretary, cannot secure additional funding to match the 2025-26 pay award.\nLast week, at its annual conference, the NEU agreed to launch a formal ballot on strike action if the government's pay offer for teachers remained \"unacceptable\" and was not fully funded in the spending review.\nAny decisions on pay will hinge on the recommendations of the independent School Teachers' Review Body (STRB), which have yet to be published.\nThe Department for Education (DfE) has told the STRB it favours a 2.8% wage increase, but the NEU and the NASUWT want an above-inflation pay rise and full compensation for school budgets, so that pay increases do not force cuts to be made elsewhere.\nDan Lister, the NASUWT's junior vice-president, told delegates in Liverpool: \"The government's recommendation to the STRB for a 2.8% partially funded pay award is not acceptable.\n\"The government's recommendation makes it clear that efficiencies will need to be made. We know what this means. It means restructures, it means redundancies, members losing their jobs and children losing their teachers.\"\nPatrick Roach, the NASUWT's general secretary, said: \"We know that the government has been handed the pay review body's latest report and we hope that the pay review body has been ambitious in putting forward recommendations that will address the ongoing recruitment and retention crisis.\"\nIf the spending review fails to top up school budgets, the two unions are likely to hold formal strike ballots among their members in the summer, setting the scene for potential school closures in the autumn.\nIn a video address to the NASUWT conference on Saturday, Phillipson told delegates: \"The toughest financial inheritance in a generation has meant that we've already had to take some incredibly difficult decisions, and I'm afraid that more are still coming.\"\nThe NASUWT scrapped a planned announcement about Roach's replacement as general secretary, after he announced in October that he would be stepping down.\nSign up to First Edition\nOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what's happening and why it matters\nafter newsletter promotion\nThe union was expected to reveal if the national executive's preferred candidate - Matt Wrack, the former Fire Bridgades Union general secretary - had been appointed unopposed, or if his grassroots challengers had received enough branch nominations to trigger an open election.\nWrack's candidacy has caused concern among members who fear his leftwing politics are a bad fit for the more moderate teaching union, while others have criticised his lack of a teaching or education background. Wrack, a former firefighter, led the FBU for 20 years until he lost re-election in January.\nUnion sources said an emergency meeting was held last week to consider legal advice over the appointment process and whether it should be extended. The NASUWT is thought to have last held a contested election for general secretary in the 1990s.\nAn NASUWT spokesperson said on Saturday: \"Following the close of nominations, the union will undertake the required checks on the validity of all nominations received and an announcement will be made at the conclusion of this process next week.\"",
      "ml_hf_summary": "The NASUWT teaching union voted to launch a strike ballot if the government fails to fully fund school budgets for teachers' pay increases in the 2025-26 academic year. The union demands that the spending review top up school budgets to match the agreed-upon pay award, which is currently under consideration by the independent School Teachers’ Review Body (STRB).  The NASUWT and the National Education Union (NEU) are poised for potential strikes if the government's proposed 2.8% wage increase is not fully funded. The decision hinges on the STRB's recommendations, expected to be released soon. If the spending review fails to meet these demands, both unions may hold formal strike ballots in the summer, potentially leading to school closures in the autumn.  \n"

      "content": "Dewi Lake, Liam Belcher, Aneurin Owen and Blair Murray\nWelsh rugby will face its self-proclaimed Judgement Day on Easter Saturday as Wales' four professional sides battle it out in the Principality Stadium.\nIt will be the 10th edition of the Welsh double-header and the ninth to be staged at the national stadium since it started in 2013, with a four-year break because of Covid.\nThis year's backdrop has again been another tumultuous period off the field with Cardiff forced into temporary administration before being taken over by the Welsh Rugby Union (WRU).\nWhile Welsh rugby continues to struggle with events off the field, this should be the showpiece of the domestic calendar with the two United Rugby Championship (URC) derbies at Welsh rugby's home.\nCardiff and Ospreys kick off proceedings at 15:00 BST before Scarlets and Dragons go head to head at 17:30 BST. So what is at stake?\nScarlets, Cardiff and Ospreys still have ambitions of finishing in the top eight of the URC and reaching the end-of-season play-offs, while Dragons are destined to finish bottom after a disastrous season which has only yielded one league victory so far.\nGoing into the latest round of fixtures, there are only nine points separating fifth to 14th places meaning those 10 teams are all battling for quarter-final spots.\nCardiff are ninth with 36 points, while Scarlets and Ospreys are 11th and 12th respectively, three points behind. \nThe regions have four games remaining in the regular season which includes the quartet travelling to South Africa at the same time in May for a two-game mini tour.\nSo victory is key this weekend for three of four Wales' professional sides before that daunting prospect. Dragons are just playing for pride.\nMorgan leads weakened Ospreys against Cardiff\nSherratt hopes Cardiff players stay after WRU deal\nCarter and Rogers return for Judgement Day derby\nWRU chief executive Abi Tierney has indicated ticket sales have not been as good as the governing body would have liked, which illustrates the current apathy towards Welsh rugby.\nThe timing of the event has been questioned with many feeling it would be better served at the start of the season.\nThe most popular event attracted an attendance of 68,262 in 2016, while the fewest people to attend at the Principality Stadium was 30,441 in 2014.\nIt has been moved back to the home of Welsh rugby this season after being held across the capital last year at the Cardiff City Stadium which produced the lowest attendance of 20,167.\nOrganisers would love to beat that this year but they will be rattling around a ground which holds a 74,500 capacity with the concept's viability under the microscope.\nJosh Turnbull was the past Cardiff captain to lift the Welsh Shield in 2023\nBelieve it or not, there could be a trophy lift on Saturday, with a victorious side raising the Welsh Shield.\nThat is a mini-table involving the four Welsh professional sides based purely on points gained in the derby games in the regular league season.\nEach team has six games against fellow Welsh sides and only Cardiff and Scarlets are in with a chance of collecting the silverware, with last season's winners Ospreys and Dragons out of contention.\nCardiff are currently three points ahead of Scarlets and know a victory against Ospreys will see them awarded the title.\nIf Cardiff draw without a bonus point, or if they lose, Scarlets will be crowned Welsh champions should they gain a maximum points victory against Dragons. \nCardiff beat Ospreys when the two sides met at Judgement Day in 2023\nCardiff head coach Matt Sherratt: \"I think being back in the Principality is massive. \n\"It's the home of rugby in Wales, right in the middle of the city, and you're getting the four regional teams with the best Welsh players under one roof on one day.\n\"There's three teams vying for the top eight, that's something I haven't experienced before.\n\"To have ourselves, Ospreys and Scarlets all in the middle of the table with something to play for adds that extra bit of spice.\"\nCardiff captain Liam Belcher: \"There's always a bit of an edge in any derby, whether there's something on it or not, we're all around about the same points tally. With four games left every point matters. If we come out with a win it puts us in great stead going forward.\n\"The best Judgement Day I had was two years ago. A lot of the boys were leaving, and to send them off with a win was unbelievable. To end that season on that high was amazing.\n\"The way the Ospreys play at the moment is quite expansive, it's great to watch. We like to think we play a nice exciting fast game, so for the neutral fans it'll be a very good exciting opening game.\"\nOspreys hooker Dewi Lake and head coach Mark Jones represent a side who have won seven out of their nine Judgement Day matches\nOspreys head coach Mark Jones: \"It's got something really meaningful on it, it's always got the passion, always got the rivalry, but doesn't often have the potential of getting into knockout stages on it, as it is at the moment it's very much an important fixture for both teams.\n\"Our boys are excited about playing on a pretty famous pitch with a lot on the line. I think it probably is a must win for us looking at how many fixtures are left.\"\nOspreys hooker Dewi Lake: \"Whenever you get the chance to play here, in front of the crowd, run out onto the turf, it's an unbelievable feeling whether you're playing for Wales or your home region.\n\"There's not major opportunities to play in this stadium, growing up as a young Welsh kid, whether you're a boy or a girl, that's something you dream of. \n\"A game like Judgement Day was talked about when I was growing up watching rugby, it's always been a fixture in the Welsh calendar.\"\nScarlets' overall record on Judgement Day' is won six and lost three\nScarlets head coach Dwayne Peel: \"This game is undoubtedly a big one and a must win for us.\n\"We've put ourselves in a position where we can push on towards the end of the season. \n\"There's points at stake and it's important for us to stay in the hunt of the top eight. \n\"The league is so tight so when there's points available you have to be ready to pounce.\"\nScarlets full-back Blair Murray: \"I've heard it's a massive day for Welsh rugby. Going against the Dragons, they got up on us the last couple of times.\n\"I love it at the Principality Stadium, the crowd's always awesome here.

It is believed some of the club hierarchy had considered a change last month - with former manager Neil Warnock considered as a replacement - only for Riza to retain the support of owner Vincent Tan.\nBut with fans calling for Riza to be removed after Friday's 2-0 loss at Bramall Lane - their fifth game without a win - the club have taken action in a late bid to avoid dropping into the third tier for the first time since 2002.\nCardiff will hope the appointment of Ramsey - one of the club's most decorated youth products - will at least galvanise supporters ahead of final games against Oxford, West Bromwich Albion and Norwich City.\nThe midfielder became the club's youngest ever player after breaking into the first-team at the age of 16 in 2007 before moving to Premier League Arsenal, where he twice won the FA Cup.\nHe returned to his boyhood club in 2023 following spells at Juventus and Nice, although his impact on the field had been limited because of injury.\nRamsey had been ruled out from any playing involvement during the Championship run-in after having surgery on a hamstring injury sustained in defeat against Luton Town last month.\nHe has worked at the club's academy during his time back in south Wales while has also provided tactical analysis for Riza from games during a previous injury lay-off earlier in the season.\nComments can not be loaded\nTo load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser\nPremier League: Man City lead Everton as Brentford & West Ham lead, Palace down to 10\nArsenal fall to first-leg Champions League defeat by Lyon\nScottish Cup semi-final: Hearts v Aberdeen - updates from Hampden\nRick Stein explores age-old traditions and modern tastes\nThe wild origins of the modern-day rollercoaster\nJohn Simm stars in the provocative 90s drama, The Lakes\nCan Shrek contend with his new in-laws?\nWilson, O'Sullivan, Trump, Selby - who will win World Snooker Championship?\nAberdeen score late extra-time winner to beat Hearts.

Ramsey will lead the team against Oxford United on Monday and is assisted by Chris Gunter and Joe Ralls.

      "summary": "The long-running dispute, now in its sixth week, has seen uncollected waste pile up in some areas.",
      "content": "In parts of Birmingham waste continues to go uncollected as all-out strike action by bin workers grinds on into its sixth week, leaving some of the city's 1.2 million residents to deal with the fallout.\nThe UK's second city is the largest local authority area in the country, with more than 400,000 households within its boundaries. But they have not been affected equally by the industrial action, and as more time has passed a contrast has begun to emerge.\nThe dispute has seen waste pile up in some areas, with the problem most stark in the densely populated inner-city areas. Wealthier, more sparsely populated parts have experienced fewer problems.\nOn the same day that the streets of Balsall Heath were being overwhelmed with rubbish, so much that it was hard in places to walk down the street, a few miles away in wealthy Harborne, wheelie bins stood neatly waiting for collection with no sign of any additional waste.\nTalks to end the bin strike in Birmingham will not resume until next week, after the Unite union and the city council failed to reach an agreement on Wednesday. \nMembers of Unite began staging one-day walkouts in January after being told some workers would be downgraded and have their pay cut. \nThe action escalated on 11 March, when more than 300 workers began an all-out strike.\nUnite said that if the council was prepared to make a firm offer of a one-off payment and guaranteed that there would not be any further pay cuts, its members would go back to work.\nFor the first three-and-a-half weeks of the industrial dispute striking bin workers used delaying tactics at the city's three main depots to prevent the working wagons, staffed by non-union members and agency staff, from leaving to carry out their rounds. \nThey walked slowly in front of the gates to delay the lorries departing and continued to walk in front of them after they had left the gates for several hundred metres. \nAlthough more than 300 staff are on strike, several hundred are not. \nThe delaying tactics meant that wagons were stopped from carrying out their rounds and only about 10% of Birmingham's regular daily bin collections were being completed. \nBy the beginning of April, because of the industrial action, 22,000 tonnes of uncollected waste had accumulated on the city's streets. \nI've been covering the industrial action since it began, and even before it escalated, piles of waste were already mounting up in parts of Birmingham. \nThis time it already seemed worse than the last strike in Birmingham in 2017, and like then, it appeared to highlight the disparity of wealth in Britain's second city. \nThe poorer the area, the worse the smell and the bigger the mess. \nThere was already talk of the infestation of rats, and a pest controller I met in Handsworth told me his workload had already doubled as result of the waste piling up in the streets.\nThe effects of the strike have been most visible in the city's most deprived wards and places like Small Heath, Sparkbrook and Ladywood. \nHere the streets of Victorian terraced houses are home to large multi-generational families or have been divided into flats. \nThe population density is highest in this area, so there is more waste, and fewer people have access to cars to take their rubbish to the tips. These are the areas where the biggest piles of rubbish have grown.\nIn Small Heath I met Semir Said, the senior outreach project manager at the Green Lane Mosque, who described how the area had been affected.\n\"It's very obvious really, piles of rubbish, mountains of rubbish really in streets inner city Birmingham, so yeah a very, very big problem,\" he said. \"Rats feasting is the way I'd describe it, so yes it's a very, very big problem.\"\nHe told me, he thought the inner city areas were faring worst. \n\"It's sad to say but these deprived areas... [you] do find this problem of not being treated fairly, it's very unfortunate, but it is the reality.\" \nThe mosque was, he said, trying to find its own solutions and that was why they had arranged for the council's street cleaning team to base their wagons there, so people could bring their rubbish to be disposed of. \nQueues of cars were waiting to offload their rubbish, and the mosque had enrolled the services of teenagers on their Easter break to help with the unloading.\nDuring the strike these have been one of the few options people could take to get rid of their rubbish. At one, at Woodgate Valley Park, on the outskirts of the city near its border with Worcestershire I witnessed a queue that was more than a mile long. \nSome people had parked their cars and were carrying unwanted items into the site, where everything was simply thrown into the same waste truck - metal, glass, household waste and recycling. Here there was exasperation and anger, and the sense that Birmingham's reputation was being dragged down. \n\"It's absolute carnage, it's scandalous\", one man with heavy bin bags in each hand and a full car to unload told me.\nI first met Naz Khan during the last bin strike when he and his friends hired a lorry to collect rubbish from people who could not take it away themselves. \nEight years later I bumped into him again, once again trying to help people get rid of their rubbish. \nHe told me that the problems in his area had been exacerbated by people from elsewhere bringing their rubbish into poorer inner-city areas to get rid of it. \n\"A lot of people are using our areas to do a lot of fly-tipping\", he said, adding that he felt there was a \"postcode issue\" when it came to bin collections. \nIn one of the biggest piles of waste I saw there was an old bed frame, several empty tins of catering cooking oil and even the front bumper from a Toyota.\nOther people have also been doing their bit and trying to clear up their neighbourhoods. Sadia Khan, the chair of Friends of Sparkgreen Park, has been organising litter picks since before the strike began, but things have only got worse since it started. \n\"It feels like the litter picks aren't making any difference, the litter and the fly-tipping is coming back twofold. It's a gloomy place to be in, it's depressing,\" she said.\nHer aim was to try to clear the park of waste before the Easter weekend so that if the weather was nice, people would be able to head out for picnics.\n\"You want a beautiful park, enjoy the Easter weekend and the holidays now, and people can't go for a picnic, they can't even have time with their friends and family out in the park.\n\"It's just so sad to see,\" she added.\nOne evening in Balsall Heath, I spoke to a resident who told me that the problems had been exacerbated by a lack of civic pride from locals, but blamed the poor waste collection service their area had experienced even before industrial action began for creating a sense of malaise. \nIt is a common complaint, that waste collections are missed here and not in wealthy Edgbaston. \nYou often hear the unsubstantiated claim that streets where councillors live are always spick-and-span, but the ones nearby are left to fend for themselves.\nPeople repeatedly have told me they believe there is a two-tier waste collection in operation.\nDuring the dispute I have put those allegations to both the leader of the council, John Cotton, and the strategic director of city operations, Craig Cooper, and each told me that they were aware of the problems and were committed, as part of the council's reorganisation of waste collection, to make things better and fairer once the strike was over. \nThe striking members of Unite also acknowledge that there has been a problem in poorer areas, but say council plans to go to fortnightly collections will simply mean a return to some of the scenes we have witnessed since March.\n\"There were so many bins it was causing conflict with neighbours\", said Alexandra Giddings, who lives with her 12-year-old son in a small house near the busy Ladypool Road, in another of the more deprived parts of Birmingham, within the city's famous Balti Triangle. \nHer son has chronic asthma and their home is damp, but she was unable to open the windows even during the recent warm spell, because of the stench from the bins that had been mounting up outside. \nThings have begun to improve since strikers were prevented from delaying the non-striking bin workers from completing their rounds and army logistics experts were brought in to help with the clear-up. \nDespite one recent collection, the bins are piling up again and the stink is really unpleasant. \n\"I want to go out at least for a walk. Now, I don't want to because the smell's horrendous,\" Ms Giddings said.\nThe situation has changed since the beginning of the fifth week of the strike. \nWest Midlands Police stopped the strikers' delaying tactics by threatening them with arrest and being fined, which enabled more working wagons to carry out daily collections, so that now about 50% of the council's fleet is fully operational. \nIt cannot separate household waste from recycling, but everyone should now be getting a weekly collection. \nPeople who had waited for six weeks to see a bin lorry have finally had their black bags removed, with the most noticeable improvement made since Army logistics experts were brought in, as they have been able to better co-ordinate the clear up. \nThe council said that the backlog of waste should have been cleared by this weekend. \nBy Wednesday, the amount of uncollected waste had fallen to less than 5,000 tonnes. \nIt has represented a major clear-up operation since the police tactics changed on the picket line and the behind-the-scenes interventions by the government. \nOne of the striking bin men, Dave, said: \"We say to the people of Birmingham, obviously we're residents ourselves, and we really apologise... we're going to make every effort to come back to work as soon as possible and collect the bins again\".\nNearly everyone I have spoken to has their own \"rat\" story. \nReports of infestations have been a headline writer and meme maker's dream, but the rodents have proven surprisingly difficult to capture on film. \nWhen, before the all-out strike began, one resident told BBC News that there were \"rats the size of cats\" roaming the streets, it gave birth to the phrase that will haunt Birmingham and may tarnish its reputation for the foreseeable future.\nAdditional reporting by Katie Thompson\nFollow BBC Birmingham on BBC Sounds, Facebook, X and Instagram.\nBin workers remain in a stand-off with the council after an all-out strike started on 11 March.\nThe government says office-based military experts will help because of the \"public health risk\".\nA group of volunteer litter-pickers in Birmingham say they are desperate for a resolution.\nThe council has set up mobile bin collections for residents to unload their waste amid the strike.\nResidents in Sparkbrook say the stench and the number of rats are unbearable and pose a health risk.\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

      "content": "The felling of a 500-year-old ancient oak in north London has led to an outpouring of anger, echoing the reaction when the Sycamore Gap tree is alleged to have been chopped down in September 2023.\nWhat provokes such a response when these trees are destroyed, and do they have any protection?\nNot surprisingly, the length of time that a tree has existed is the main reason for a specimen to be classed as ancient.\n\"Ancient trees are those which have passed beyond maturity and are into the ancient life phase - which for some trees can be the longest stage of their life,\" explains Dr Ed Pyne, senior conservation adviser for trees at conservation charity the Woodland Trust.\nThe amount of time for this to happen varies for different types of trees, with some taking more time to pass maturity.\nA birch tree can be classed as ancient when it reaches 150 years old because of its fast-growing nature, while a slow-growing yew tree would not receive the same accolade until it was around 800 years old.\nSuch age means they tend to be low, squat trees which have a small canopy and a very wide trunk that is often decaying and hollow.\nThere are also trees known as veterans, which may not necessarily be as old, but they have similar characteristics to ancient trees with high amounts of decay like heart rot.\nSuch decay was \"not a disease and not a cause for concern\" but \"a normal, healthy kind of part of the trees' physiological development\", said Dr Pyne.\nThe Woodland Trust runs an Ancient Tree Inventory, which lists more than 190,000 of the UK's oldest and more important trees, although Dr Pyne points out it is still only \"a snapshot and quite incomplete\".\nAncient trees can be found across the country on both public and private land, with the most surviving examples to be found in what were once extensive royal hunting grounds like the New Forest and Windsor Great Park.\nOthers can be found in places as diverse as housing estates, urban parks, village greens and churchyards.\nBritain is known as being particularly rich in ancient trees, with the country having more ancient and veteran oak trees than anywhere else in Europe.\nDr Pyne said this was generally down to historic factors like the existence of large hunting grounds which have protected the trees from development over the years.\nThe decaying nature of ancient and veteran trees is one of their key characteristics because of the microhabitats they offer to wildlife, providing homes and food to everything from fungi and lichen to bats and birds.\nThe huge length of time that the decay takes to develop also makes these sites much rarer and richer compared to younger trees.\nOne study found it takes over 200 years for heart rot to start developing in oaks, with substantial amounts of it only occurring after around 400 years.\n\"Some of the biodiversity associated with this decay can be very, very specialised and some species that utilise these habitats can be very rare. \n\"Many of them are threatened simply because there's not a lot of this,\" Dr Pyne says.\nThere is also the historical element of ancient trees, linking them to past periods of time.\nFor example, the Tolpuddle Martyrs' Tree, an ancient sycamore in Dorset, is regarded as the birthplace of the trade union movement, being where farm workers met in 1834 to protest over wages.\nAs for the Enfield oak, it \"would have been a young tree when Guy Fawkes was devising the Gunpowder Plot at nearby Whitewebbs House\", said Dr Pyne.\nAnd finally, there is the cultural value that ancient trees provide, with people creating their own connections to them.\n\"We've all got trees that we remember from our childhood. That was the tree everyone met at the park, or where you met on your first date,\" he said.\nThis was particularly the case for the Sycamore Gap tree, which was not classed as ancient, having been planted in the late 1800s, but became iconic because of its position beside Hadrian's Wall and its use in the 1991 film Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves.\nThere are several policies and pieces of legislation in place which provide some protection for ancient and veteran trees in Britain, including:\nDr Pyne believes such legislation is \"pretty good\" when it comes to protecting trees, although improvements could be made.\nIndeed, a joint report issued this week by the Tree Council and Forest Research warned that trees were only indirectly protected by the law and called for a more \"robust and effective system\".\nThe oak, which was cut down on 3 April, was located on the edge of council-owned Whitewebbs Park and overlooked a Toby Carvery.\nMitchells & Butlers, which owns Toby Carvery, said on Tuesday that it was responsible for chopping down the pedunculate oak, which had been done \"to protect our employees and guests as well as the wider general public\".\nHowever, Enfield Council told the BBC a recent inspection carried out on the tree found it could have lived for several more centuries.\nDr Pyne said the tree had \"fallen through the gap\" in terms of legislation.\n\"It didn't have a tree preservation order, it's not in a conservation area, and although there's been lots of planning applications in the area surrounding this tree, there hasn't been any planning application in the direct area of the tree, and so the planning policy framework hasn't kicked in.\n\"The loss is a tragedy, really,\" he added.\nListen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, X and Instagram.

The tree's removal was attributed by Mitchells & Butlers (owner of the Toby Carvery) to safety reasons for employees and guests, but Enfield Council stated an inspection revealed potential longevity. The loss of this ancient oak is a significant event as it highlights the need for stronger legislation to protect these valuable trees.  The Woodland Trust's Ancient Tree Inventory lists over 190,000 such trees across the UK, with many found in historically protected areas like royal hunting grounds and parks. These trees are not only important for their age but also provide unique habitats for wildlife and hold cultural significance for individuals. While legislation exists to protect ancient trees, there is a need for improvement to ensure their continued preservation. \n"

      "content": "After months of mounting pressure on the university to defend itself, Harvard rejected a series of Trump administration demands - here's what happened\nIt took Harvard University less than 72 hours to reject a series of demands put forth by the Trump administration, setting up a high-stakes showdown between the US's wealthiest and oldest university and the White House.\nThe swift rebuke on Monday came after weeks of mounting pressure from Harvard faculty, students, alumni, and the city of Cambridge, all urging the university to defend itself, and higher education as a whole, against what they saw as an unprecedented attack from Washington.\nHarvard was one of the first universities to face national scrutiny following 7 October 2023 and the ensuing campus protests over Israel's war in Gaza, as critics accused the school and its leaders of failing to adequately combat antisemitism on its campus.\nAnd this February, just weeks into Trump's presidency, the administration's new Federal Task Force to Combat antisemitism announced that it would be visiting 10 universities, including Harvard, in an effort to \"eradicate antisemitic harassment\" in schools.\nSoon after, the White House went after Columbia University, first launching a review of its federal funding, and then revoking $400m in federal funds from the school, citing the college's failure to protect students from antisemitic harassment amid the campus protests against the war in Gaza.\nIn response, groups of Harvard faculty, alumni, students and Cambridge community members began calling on their own university leaders - through protests, letters, op-eds and resolutions - to publicly oppose the administration's actions and to resist any future demands and pressure from the White House.\nOn 6 March, the day before Columbia's funding was cut, Harvard professors Ryan Enos and Steven Levitsky penned an op-ed in the Crimson, Harvard's student newspaper, criticizing the university's silence, and urging Harvard leaders to set an example by making \"a firm public defense of democracy\".\nDays later, immigration authorities arrested Palestinian activist and recent Columbia graduate Mahmoud Khalil, and Trump officials warned 60 universities of potential penalties tied to antiseminism investigations.\nThat week, nearly 200 Harvard affiliates gathered on campus and protested Khalil's detention, and urged the university to condemn the administration's actions.\nEnos and Levitsky followed with another op-ed, this time titled: \"First they came for Columbia.\"\n\"So far, America's leading universities have remained virtually silent in the face of this authoritarian assault on institutions of higher education,\" they wrote. \"That must change. Harvard must stand up, speak out, and lead a public defense of our freedom to speak and study freely.\"\nThe piece resonated widely within the Harvard community, Enos said, even reportedly reaching Harvard's board of overseers (one of the school's two governing bodies).\nEnos decided to write to several members of the board of overseers, sharing arguments from his recent op-eds. He had heard that some board members were sympathetic to their view.\nIn mid-March, universities watched Columbia yield to a series of sweeping demands made by the Trump administration in an effort to restore the halted funding. (The funding remains withheld, and reports now suggest that a possible consent decree is on the table.)\nEnos and others feared that when the time came, Harvard might follow suit. At this point, Enos said, Harvard's leadership had shown \"no indication\" that they were willing to put up a public fight in defense of Harvard or public education more generally.\nIn the weeks prior, the university appeared to be taking preemptive steps to get ahead to of the administration's potential crackdown and funding cuts. They announced a university-wide hiring freeze, and made several decisions that critics viewed as aligning with the administration's priorities.\nThe university adopted a controversial definition of antisemitism in a legal settlement over complaints brought by Jewish students, ousted two leaders of its Center for Middle Eastern Studies, suspended a public health partnership with Birzeit University in the West Bank and a \"religion, conflict and peace initiative\" at the Harvard Divinity School amid accusations that it focused \"entirely on the Palestinians\", and banned the Undergraduate Palestine Solidarity Committee from hosting events on campus.\nThese actions caused concern for some who worried that Harvard was compromising academic freedom to appease the government.\n\"Someone might reasonably think that these changes were in order to accommodate, to demonstrate to the federal government, look, we're closing down programs that have been accused of imbalanced coverage,\" said Kirsten Weld, a professor of History at Harvard, who heads Harvard's chapter of the American Association of University Professors (AAUP).\nOn 24 March, Enos and Levitsky, with help from several others, circulated a letter among faculty, urging Harvard's two governing boards to publicly condemn the attacks on universities, legally contest and resist unlawful demands, and mount a coordinated opposition.\nMore than 800 faculty members signed, though some non-US citizens refrained due to fear, Enos said.\nThe letter was sent to governing board members ahead of their next scheduled meeting, which was coming up on 5 and 6 April.\nSeparately, in another letter, more than 1,000 Harvard alumni urged Harvard's president, Alan Garber, to defend academic freedom and free speech, and to take a stronger stand.\n\"We cannot appease the Trump administration - it always asks for more,\" the letter warned.\nJames Stodder, who drafted and circulated that letter, said that he and a group of other alumni were looking for ways they could make their voices heard.\nAnother alumni letter with more than 1,200 signatures called for courage over capitulation.\nIn late March, Harvard's chapter of AAUP along with the National Chapter and other groups, sued the Trump administration, alleging it violated members' first amendment rights by targeting pro-Palestinian speech by non-citizens.\nAround this time, the Crimson was reporting that Garber had been privately discussing the administration's pressure campaign with other university leaders.\nThen, on 31 March, the Trump administration put Harvard directly in its crosshairs, announcing a review of Harvard's $9bn in federal funding, citing alleged failures to address antisemitism on campus.\nGarber's response was seen by some as conceding to the administration's narrative and suggestions.\nOn 3 April, Trump officials sent Harvard a letter, stating that its federal funding would be conditional on changes such as eliminating diversity and inclusion programs, reviewing its programs \"to address bias\", cooperating with law enforcement and the Department of Homeland security, and installing leaders to implement the president's demands, and more.\n\"We said to ourselves, OK, we're now in the same position as Columbia,\" Weld said. \"This is kind of the first shot across the bow.\"\nThat same day, Enos and Levitsky published a third op-ed: \"Appeasing Trump Damages Harvard and America\", urging the university to resist and take a stand.\nEnos said he heard from alumni who had begun threatening to withhold donations to the school if Harvard didn't stand up against Trump.\nAfter receiving initial demands from the administration, the Wall Street Journal reported that Harvard leaders were in contact with the administration in pursuit of an agreement. Federal officials reportedly believed that Harvard would eventually concede, as Columbia had. Harvard said that the demands were too vague and requested more details.\nHarvard's governing boards met as planned in early April. While no details from those meetings were released, Enos believes their faculty letter was likely discussed, noting that last year he was told that the governing bodies had found a similar letter he organized in support of former Harvard president Claudine Gay to be \"very persuasive\".\n\"I would find it shocking if they ignored or at least didn't consider that kind of outpouring of faculty support,\" Enos said.\nFollowing the weekend meeting, the Cambridge city council passed a unanimous resolution urging Harvard to reject Trump's demands, and to \"use all measures possible, including the University's endowment funds, if necessary, to safeguard academic independence, the rule of law, and democracy.\"\nCouncilmember Burhan Azeem, who co-sponsored the resolution, said he wanted Harvard to know that they had the support of the city behind them if they chose to stand up to the administration.\nAzeem said it's rare for the city council to get involved in internal Harvard affairs, but the stakes were high.\n\"We were trying to convey to Harvard that the city is not the most powerful institution, but we are an institution, we have lawyers and we are willing to take action and we are willing to stand by them,\" Azeem said.\nBy this point, despite the Trump administration's 3 April letter demanding \"immediate cooperation\", Harvard had not yet publicly responded.\nOn 11 April, Harvard's AAUP chapter filed a second lawsuit against the administration, this time challenging the federal review of the university's federal funding.\nThe next day, hundreds of Harvard affiliates and Cambridge residents rallied in near-freezing temperatures at Cambridge Common, demanding once more that the university resist the federal pressure and also protect its international students and faculty.\nUnbeknownst to the protesters, behind closed doors that weekend, Harvard leaders were parsing through a new five-page letter from the Trump administration that had been delivered late on Friday.\nThe letter included a list of sweeping demands - the shuttering of all diversity, equity and inclusion programs and initiatives, restrictions on the acceptance of international students who are \"hostile to the American values and institutions\", and federal oversight of admissions, hiring and the ideology of students and staff and more.\nHarvard officials were stunned by the demands in the letter, the Wall Street Journal reported, viewing them as more extreme than those sent to other schools. A Sunday board meeting ended in unanimous agreement on how to respond.\nThen, on Monday 14 April, Harvard released its statement publicly rejecting the demands, and released the administration's Friday letter.\n\"Although some of the demands outlined by the government are aimed at combating antisemitism,\" the \"majority represent direct governmental regulation of the 'intellectual conditions' at Harvard\", Harvard's president wrote.\n\"The University will not surrender its independence or relinquish its constitutional rights. No government - regardless of which party is in power - should dictate what private universities can teach, whom they can admit and hire, and which areas of study and inquiry they can pursue.\"\nIt was then Harvard became the first major US university to openly defy the administration's demands.\nGarber's office did not respond to a request for comment on how the decision came together. But, Enos believes that the pressure from faculty, alumni, students and others, mattered.\n\"I think we did manage to put a tremendous amount of pressure on Harvard to do the right thing,\" Enos said. \"It came from all circles.\"\nWeld said she was \"very glad\" when she read the announcement, adding that the demands from the Trump administration were \"such an egregious overreach\". Accepting them, she said, would have been \"disastrous\".\nHarvard's announcement drew support from Democrats, as well as Harvard faculty, alumni, and leaders of other universities.\nThe Crimson reported a surge in donations to Harvard after the announcement, with the school receiving an average of 88 online donations per hour. Between Monday when the announcement was made, and 9am Wednesday, nearly 4,000 gifts totaling $1.14m were made, according to giving update from by Harvard alumni affairs and development obtained by the Crimson.\nBut the battle has only just begun. The fight this week has already escalated.\nFollowing Harvard's announcement, federal officials froze over $2bn in grants to the university. Trump has threatened to strip Harvard of its tax-exempt status and its ability to enroll international students.\nOn Thursday, the Trump administration accused Harvard - in yet another letter to Garber - of failing to report large foreign donations to the federal government, as is required by law. They demanded that Harvard provide names of foreign donors, including records of communication with all of them from the beginning of 2020, and records pertaining to foreigners who spent time at Harvard; that latter group includes students Harvard expelled or those who had their credentials canceled, going back to 2016.\nA Harvard spokesperson told the New York Times on Friday: \"Harvard has filed Section 117 reports for decades as part of its ongoing compliance with the law.\"\nLayoffs have already been reported at the Harvard School of Public Health, with warnings at Harvard Medical School too.\nThough Harvard's endowment is sure to offer some financial cushion, the New York Times reports that about 80% of it is limited to specific purposes.\n\"It's going to get more painful before it gets better,\" Enos said.\nWeld said that the AAUP will continue to proceed with their lawsuits against the administration and that concerns remain regarding Harvard's decisions earlier this year to \"shut down spaces of independent critical inquiry related to Palestine on our campus\".\nStill, she said it was \"vitally important\" for the whole higher education sector that Harvard was fighting back.\n\"If Harvard had not stood up and rejected the Trump administration's demands, it would have sent generational chill through higher education in this country,\" she said.\n\"If Harvard, the richest university in human history, cannot stand up and fight back to unquestionably illegal demands, then what other institution is going to feel that it's safe for them to do so?\"",

      "content": "The editorial board\nPublishedApril 18 2025\nYour guide to what the 2024 US election means for Washington and the world\nHarvard University risks paying a high price for its courage in standing up to intimidation by the Trump administration. Since the oldest US university refused to bow to White House attempts to force changes in its governance, federal officials have said they would freeze $2.2bn in funding. The Internal Revenue Service is examining whether to revoke its tax-exempt status. The government has threatened to ban it from enrolling foreign students. Yet academic freedoms and independence of higher education from state diktat are values that must be defended. Harvard is right to take a stand. Other universities should do the same. \nThe Trumpian assault on universities is ostensibly about purging \"woke\" ideology from classrooms and hiring, and combating alleged antisemitism. The administration has been threatening to withhold federal funding unless schools submit to its edicts, arresting students who took part in pro-Palestinian protests and capping scientific research costs -- potentially a huge own goal against the American economy. \nUS universities do need to consider why they have become such bitter targets of the populist right. Some have gone too far in allowing left-leaning sentiment to predominate, tolerating practices such as \"no-platforming\", and allowing education costs to spiral. But much right-wing criticism has been exaggerated, and threats and coercion from the White House are no way to bring about reform. \nIn reality, US universities are one target in a broader, insidious attack on liberal thinking and its perceived bastions by the Trump circle. This amounts to an attempt to control institutions that shape US intellectual and cultural debate. Bringing universities to heel is a hallmark of authoritarian regimes, as indeed is using tax threats as coercion.\nIt is regrettable that New York's Columbia University chose to capitulate to the White House, though it was attacked first and received little public support. Even Harvard bowed to some earlier orders including changing the leadership of its Middle Eastern studies department. But after pressure from faculty, students, and probably some alumni, it rejected further government demands -- including an external audit of \"viewpoint diversity\" -- as illegal. Its president Alan Garber wrote that no government \"should dictate what private universities can teach, whom they can admit and hire, and which areas of study and inquiry they can pursue\".\nIf any institution is equipped to stand up to the Trump administration it is Harvard, given its $53bn endowment, establishment clout and in-house legal brainpower. The presidents of Princeton and Stanford have spoken out in defence of academic freedoms. But Ivy League schools should form a common front, to resist attempts to pick them off one by one, and join with next-tier universities that have been faster to unite.\nHarvard and others should be prepared to dip into their endowments to help weather the storm in the short term, though an unfortunate casualty may be wider access for lower-income students. They should mount a determined legal fightback in the courts. \nThere is a strong case that the Trump administration has exceeded its authority, in failing to respect academic freedoms and to follow due process. It has brandished penalties out of all proportion to universities' alleged transgressions, without presenting clear evidence or waiting for formal hearings or appeals. The White House has shown itself ready to defy judges, as with its illegal deportations of Venezuelan migrants. Doing so repeatedly, however, might provoke pushback from broader sections of US society.\nHarvard has entered a high-stakes battle. But the university's stance might yet prove a turning point that will galvanise others -- including law firms and businesses that have kowtowed to Trump -- into resisting the widening assault on freedoms that Americans have long held dear.",

      "summary": "The judgement provides a clear framework for what equality laws mean, but it remains to be seen what will change.",
      "content": "\"A victory for common sense\" or \"devastating\" - the contrasting reactions to the statement by five Supreme Court judges that legally the term \"woman\" means a biological woman.\nBehind the different responses lie many of the often bitter and vitriolic arguments that set the country on a long, tricky road towards Wednesday's unambiguous judgement.\nWhen the highest court in the land ruled that sex is binary - meaning legally it should be interpreted as referring to either a biological man or a biological woman - it was providing clarity that had been missing from such conversations for years.\nWords like \"woman\" and \"sex\" had become loaded with different meanings depending on your viewpoint. Language that for centuries had been uncomplicated and accepted, became a battleground.\nThe judgement is intended to draw a line under that.\nIt argues that for the Equality Act to be consistent, the term woman has to mean a biological woman. That does not include biological males, even if they have certificates to say they have changed gender.\nThis means that where there are, for instance, women-only spaces, then a biological man who identifies as a woman cannot use them. That includes changing rooms, toilets, women's refuges, single-sex hospital wards and anywhere designated as for one sex only.\nHow much change that will mean in practice will be set out in detailed guidance. Until then, there remain lots of questions and some confusion - and that is challenging in an area where views are so polarised.\nIt was Baroness Falkner, the woman who heads the watchdog that regulates equality laws, who described the judgement as a victory for common sense.\nShe added it was only such a victory if you recognised trans people, \"that they exist, they have rights, and their rights must be respected\".\nShe also told the BBC about the abuse she had faced since taking over as chair of the Equalities and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) in 2020.\nShe had previously told the Times that women had the right to question gender identity, and that had led to some very personal abuse from those who disagreed with her.\n\"I had not realised how difficult the job would be,\" she said. \"It has taken a toll, but if you are in public life you have to take that.\"\nThe second response to the judgement was from the trans rights campaign group TransActual, which described the Supreme Court judgement as devastating.\nOne of its activists, Jane Fae, told the BBC the judgement felt like a physical body blow, and that it was as if trans people were being excluded from society.\n\"Today we're feeling very alone\" she said. \"What does this mean - can I use this loo, can I do that, can I do the other?\"\nIn contrast, the women's groups who fought the case feel vindicated and jubilant.\nHelen Joyce, the director of advocacy at the campaign group Sex Matters, says the ruling is \"incredibly important for the half of humanity who need single-sex spaces\".\nWomen's groups argue that the ruling is important for reasons of privacy, safety, dignity and discrimination.\nThe Supreme Court case was brought by a group called For Women Scotland. It wanted to overturn Scottish legislation which said 50% of members on public boards should be women - and trans women were included in their definition.\nThe group lost its case in Scotland's highest court but appealed to the UK Supreme Court. The case was heard towards the end of last year.\n\"What we wanted was clarity in the law - when something is described as a single-sex service, a single-sex space, that this relates to biology,\" Susan Smith from For Women Scotland told the BBC.\nOver time the arguments over how a woman is defined had become increasingly angry, bitter and divided, because the stakes were high for all involved.\nFor transgender people, who say they often face victimisation and harassment, the battles were rooted in attempts to win better legal protection.\n\"Legal gender recognition is essential for trans people to enjoy the full spectrum of rights each of us is entitled to, including safety, health and family life,\" according to Sacha Deshmukh, the chief executive of Amnesty International UK. The charity opposed For Women Scotland's case in the Supreme Court.\nThe question of how to achieve legal recognition rose to prominence in 2002 when two judgements at the European Court of Human Rights found the UK was breaching human rights by failing to legally recognise transgender people in their acquired gender.\nThis eventually led to the 2005 Gender Recognition Act, which allowed a trans person to apply for a Gender Recognition Certificate (GRC). This recognised their preferred gender rather than their biological sex, allowing official documents like birth certificates to be changed to reflect that.\nBut it was a long-winded process requiring two doctors to sign it off and for the person to \"live in their acquired gender\" for at least two years. Only about 8,000 people have applied for a GRC since they came into being, according to government figures.\nCampaigners began calling for the process to be simplified. In a response to a 2020 government consultation on amending the GRA, Stonewall, the LGBTQ+ rights organisation, called for a \"move to a de-medicalised and straightforward legal gender recognition process\".\nGradually these calls gained momentum.\nIn 2022, the Scottish government introduced a law that would allow people to \"self-identify\" in their desired gender. This was later blocked by the UK government and eventually dropped as a Scottish policy.\nAs the rights of trans people were being debated, women's groups started pushing back about what that meant for biological women.\nThe meaning of words like \"woman\" and \"sex\" took on new significance, if someone who was biologically male had a certificate that identified them as a woman for legal purposes.\nUnder the 2010 Equality Act, sex was a protected characteristic, and so was gender reassignment. With the very meaning of those categories in dispute, legal experts said it set the protections of one group against the protections of another.\nThe complexities mean courts and tribunals have frequently been called on to arbitrate.\nAnd social media has often provided a starting point for angry disputes, connecting and amplifying voices, and in many cases, leading to more entrenched viewpoints. It had become a culture war.\nIn 2019, tax expert Maya Forstater lost her job because she tweeted that she did not believe people could change their sex. She said biological sex was immutable and not the same as gender identity. \nAs a result, her work contract was not renewed. Her employer said it wanted to build an inclusive workplace.\nShe lost her case at an employment tribunal case, but an Appeal Court judge later ruled that gender critical beliefs were protected by the Equalities Act. In 2023, she was awarded PS100,000 compensation for unfair dismissal.\nIt was a high-profile battle through tribunals and courts which put employers' policies on inclusion under the spotlight and raised questions about whether by protecting the rights of one group, another was being discriminated against.\nMs Forstater went on to set up the campaign group Sex Matters, and was among those celebrating outside the Supreme Court on Wednesday.\nThere have been other similar cases brought against employers since then. Sex Matters lists 11 settled or ongoing cases on its website.\nBut other high-profile cases have also shaped the broader debate.\nIn March 2020, 23-year-old Keira Bell took legal action against the only children's NHS gender clinic, saying she should have been challenged more by medical staff over her decision to transition to a male whilst a teenager.\nAlthough she eventually lost her case, it started a chain reaction, which led to a shake-up of gender services for children and young people.\nAnd in 2021 the Sussex University professor, Kathleen Stock, quit her job after being accused of having transphobic views. She had published a book that questioned whether gender identity was more significant than biological sex.\nShe denied being transphobic but was subjected to a student campaign to remove her from her post. The university was later fined for failing to uphold freedom of speech.\nThese and other cases put an uncomfortable spotlight on a debate that many preferred to ignore or dismiss as mainly happening on social media, because it was too tricky and using the wrong language could lead to abuse.\nYet fundamental questions were being raised about freedom of speech, how we treat each other and how you define a woman. The need for clarity had become overwhelming.\nIn terms of equality law, the Supreme Court ruling provided that.\nFor women's groups there is sheer relief that biological facts will now drive decisions.\nBut for many trans people there is distress. Even though they still have protections under the Equality Act, for many it does not feel like that. They worry that harassment will increase.\nActivist Charlie Craggs, who is a trans woman, told the BBC it was really sad that this tiny community of less than 1% of the population was being \"thrown under the bus\".\nCrucially, the ruling provides a clear framework for what equality laws mean. The EHRC says it is \"working at pace\" to update its guidance, and expects that to be ready by the summer.\nIt has already made it clear that if a single-sex space, like a toilet or changing room, is women-only, that means biological males who identify as women should not use it.\nIt says instead that trans people should use their \"powers of advocacy\" to campaign for third spaces, such as unisex toilets.\nAnd it has said it will pursue the NHS if it does not follow the latest ruling.\nHealth service guidance on single-sex wards currently says that \"trans people should be accommodated according to their presentation, the way they dress, and the name and pronouns they currently use\".\nCurrently this allows trans women to be offered beds on women-only wards.\nThe NHS says its policy is under review.\nFormer Supreme Court judge Lord Sumption says that while the ruling means organisations can exclude trans women from women only facilities, they are not necessarily obliged to do so.\nHe told Radio 4's PM programme that in sport, for example, it would be down to individual governing bodies to decide who is allowed to compete in women's sport.\n\"They could decide to allow trans women to compete on the same basis as biological women, some sporting authorities do, although I think that in light of the latest judgement, they would be wise to say so expressly in their rules,\" he said.\nBritish Transport Police has been the first body to actually change its policies. It says strip searches of people in custody will be carried out by officers of the same biological sex\nIt means a trans woman would be searched by a male officer, and a police officer who is a trans woman would not be able to search a biological woman.\nThe domestic violence charity Refuge says the ruling will not change the way it operates.\nIts chief executive, Gemma Sherrington, says, \"we remain firmly committed to supporting all survivors of domestic abuse, including trans women\".\nBut for many businesses, sports clubs and other organisations it is too soon to know what this will mean in practice.\nThey will need to see the detailed guidance from the Equality Commission first. Until then it is difficult to know how much change, if any, they will need to make or what new issues might arise.\nSome organisations will also have to decide whether they have the space and money to provide so-called third spaces or unisex facilities\nFor trans people there is also a lot of uncertainty. They will have been used to using spaces which correspond to their gender identity - changing that may be difficult and, for some, frightening.\nThe Equality Commission expects to publish its new statutory code of conduct by the summer. Only then will these questions begin to be answered.\nTop picture credit: Reuters \nBBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

The first step in treating a problem is to correctly name the root cause.Liz MoylettTyne and Wear\n Gender self-identification has created confusion and inconsistency across our institutions. The sharp edge of this has, as usual, hurt mostly vulnerable women such as those in prison; those needing refuge from domestic violence; and those either working in, or requiring treatment from, NHS services. In these three examples we have ample evidence of male-bodied trans women violating women's protected space.\nThis clarification from the supreme court was necessary and proportionate, and should have no adverse effect on the majority, who are not violating spaces reserved for women, but simply living their lives. It also puts the onus on organisations to ensure provision for trans women who are also vulnerable to male violence, but whose needs should not be conflated with those of women for legitimate safeguarding purposes.Marian BrookeHailsham, East Sussex\n Sam Fowles writes: \"It must be remembered that this is not an abstract debate - it involves real people\" (The supreme court didn't rule on the definition of 'a woman' - this is what its judgment does mean, 16 April). Gender-critical feminists have always known that this debate involves real people; women are real people, too. It is precisely because this inconvenient fact was forgotten by the Scottish parliament - that as real people we have suffered real abuse, vilification, fear, and denial of our sex-based human rights - that the case was brought in the first place.\nThe ruling is absolute validation for those of us who have seen service providers and public bodies regard the expectations of 0.44% of the population as more important than the rights of 50%. It means that the spaces the women's movement fought for, especially those for recovery from the trauma of male violence, can again become safe for women to access.\nHaving experienced discrimination, abuse, sexual assault, violence and harassment from men because I am a woman, I do not wish anyone to experience such behaviour, be they women, trans women, trans men or men. I understand that trans women may not wish to access male spaces, so I suggest that the trans community campaign for safe transgender spaces. That way we can all have dignity and safety, and live life free from fear and intimidation. Stephanie Green Isleworth, London\n I am a mother. A mother to a transgender daughter who is about to turn 18. My daughter has rightly been devastated about this ruling and what it means for her and her hopes for the future. She hoped that the gender recognition certificate would acknowledge her identity, but she now feels her dreams have been obliterated. I would like to ask the women who have campaigned for this ruling: how many transgender women do you know? How many have you spoken to? Have you thought about what this means to them?\nMy daughter does not want to be an athlete and compete in the Olympics or sit on a board in Scotland - she wants a normal life. A normal life is being able to drink fluids when you are at college. I've seen my daughter severely dehydrated, putting her health at risk, because she is too scared to go to the toilet.\nMy daughter is so brave to go out every day and face the staring, the remarks, the laughing. Transgender women already have so much to overcome. The protections stated in the Equality Act do not protect from the narrow-minded, the cruel and the heartless. On Wednesday, I was ashamed to be a woman.Name and address supplied\n Since coming out as a trans woman a few years ago, I have been in the habit of using women's loos without causing offence or even a raised eyebrow. Do I no longer have this option? With my hairstyle and general appearance, I would be an obvious misfit in the gents, inviting name-calling or worse. So what am I to do when caught short?\nThe system before the latest ruling has generally worked well, including special exceptions for single-sex spaces where appropriate. There have been a small number of high-profile mistakes, such as the housing of a self-identified trans woman with convictions for molesting women in a women's jail. Such things call for sensible management rather than sweeping change.\nI feel significantly less safe today than I did before the judgment. We have taken a sad backward step towards a darker, less compassionate age.Rachel IsherwoodBroughton-in-Furness, Cumbria\n I am a trans woman, I am pre-op but living full-time as a woman. I am on hormone-adjusting medication. I fought long and hard against the idea of transitioning until it became the only option for my sanity. My question is: who is most at risk, a woman when I use the ladies toilets, or me if I use the gents? This ruling and its ramifications scare me.Name and address supplied",
      "ml_hf_summary": "The Supreme Court's recent ruling on gender recognition has sparked debate about single-sex spaces and their implications for trans women. The ruling clarifies that gender self-identification does not automatically equate to a woman, but it also emphasizes the need for safe spaces for all individuals.  The ruling acknowledges the vulnerability of trans women to male violence while emphasizing the importance of providing appropriate safeguards. Many argue that this ruling will help restore safety and access to services for women who have faced abuse and harassment from men. The article highlights concerns about the potential impact on transgender women's ability to use restrooms and other spaces designated for their gender identity, as well as the broader implications for trans rights and equality. \n"

Right now trans people are coming together to demonstrate to the country, and to everybody else, that we're not going anywhere because we don't have anywhere to go...\n\"Queer people have been through worse than this before, and... we'll suffer through whatever is to come in the next few years.\"\nRead more:How Supreme Court decision has immediate real-world consequences\nThe activist continued: \"The government needs to immediately clarify how they are going to protect trans people and what this ruling actually means for spaces.\n\"It does not bring clarity... businesses and venues at the moment don't know what they can and can't do... the government needs to step in and put equalities law back on a sound footing.\"\nIt comes as Bridgerton actress Nicola Coughlan announced she has helped raise more than PS100,000 for a trans rights charity following the Supreme Court decision.\nFollowing the ruling, the Irish star said she was \"completely horrified\" and \"disgusted\" by the ruling and added she would match donations up to PS10,000 to transgender charity Not A Phase.\nThe fundraiser has since raised PS103,018, with a revised target of PS110,000.\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player \n Why was the case heard in court?\nThe Supreme Court ruling followed a long-running legal challenge which centred around how sex-based rights are applied through the UK-wide Equality Act 2010.\nThe appeal case was brought against the Scottish government by campaign group For Women Scotland (FWS) following unsuccessful challenges at the Court of Session in Edinburgh.\nFWS called on the court to find sex an \"immutable biological state\", arguing sex-based protections should only apply to people born female.\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player \n The Scottish government argued the protections should also include transgender people with a gender recognition certificate (GRC).\nThe Supreme Court judges were asked to rule on what the Equality Act 2010 means by \"sex\" - whether biological sex or \"certificated\" sex as legally defined by the 2004 Gender Recognition Act.\nDelivering the ruling at the London court on Wednesday, Lord Hodge said: \"We counsel against reading this judgment as a triumph of one or more groups in our society at the expense of another. It is not.\n\"The Equality Act 2010 gives transgender people protection, not only against discrimination through the protected characteristic of gender reassignment, but also against direct discrimination, indirect discrimination and harassment in substance in their acquired gender.\"",
      "ml_hf_summary": "On April 19th, 2025, thousands of trans rights activists demonstrated in London after the UK Supreme Court ruled that \"woman\" and \"sex\" in the Equality Act 2010 refer to biological sex. This ruling means transgender women with gender recognition certificates are not legally recognized as women, potentially impacting their access to single-sex spaces like changing rooms. The decision was based on a legal challenge brought by For Women Scotland (FWS) against the Scottish government's stance on trans rights.  The Supreme Court ruled in favor of FWS, stating that sex-based protections should only apply to people born female. This ruling has sparked protests and calls for action from various groups including Trans Kids Deserve Better, Pride In Labour, and Flint. Actress Nicola Coughlan has also contributed significantly to the cause by raising over £100,000 for a trans rights charity following the Supreme Court decision. \n"

      "content": "Iran and the US have held a second round of high-stakes nuclear talks in Rome - and agreed to meet again next week - even as hopes for de-escalation are tempered by mounting military threats and mixed messages.\nUS President Donald Trump reminds Tehran nearly every day of its options: a deal or war.\nHe has previously said Israel would lead a military response if the talks failed.\nOn Wednesday, the New York Times reported that Trump had \"waved off\" an Israeli plan to strike Iranian nuclear sites as early as next month.\n\"I wouldn't say waved off. I'm not in a rush to do it,\" Trump told reporters in response to the article on Thursday, adding that he preferred to give diplomacy a chance.\n\"I think that Iran has a chance to have a great country and to live happily without death... That's my first option. If there's a second option, I think it would be very bad for Iran.\" \nAfter both sides described the first round of talks in Oman last weekend as constructive, Trump had said he would be \"making a decision on Iran very quickly\".\nIn 2018, Trump pulled the US out of a 2015 agreement which saw Iran limit its nuclear activities and allow inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in return for sanctions relief.\nHe said it did too little to stop Iran's potential pathway to a nuclear weapon and reinstated US sanctions as part of a \"maximum pressure\" campaign to compel Iran to negotiate a new deal.\nHowever, Iran refused and increasingly breached restrictions in retaliation. It has now stockpiled enough highly-enriched uranium to make several bombs if it chose to do so - something it says it would never do.\nThe threat of military action appears to have played a role in bringing Iran back to the negotiating table. Yet it insists that is not the reason.\nThe website of the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said Iran had agreed to talks only because the US limited its demands strictly to nuclear issues - not out of fear of US and Israeli strikes.\nEven so, reaching a deal remains far from certain.\nTrump's Special Envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff, who is leading the US negotiating team, posted on X on Tuesday: \"Any final arrangement must set a framework for peace, stability, and prosperity in the Middle East - meaning that Iran must stop and eliminate its nuclear enrichment and weaponization programme.\"\nIt came just a day after he had suggested in an interview with Fox News that Iran would be allowed to continue enriching uranium.\n\"They do not need to enrich past 3.67%,\" he said, referring to the limit set by the 2015 nuclear deal. \n\"This is going to be much about verification on the enrichment programme and then ultimately verification on weaponization.\"\nIran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, the head of the Iranian delegation, responded by noting Witkoff's \"contradictory statements\" and stressing that \"real positions will be made clear at the negotiating table\".\n\"We are ready to build trust regarding possible concerns over Iran's enrichment, but the principle of enrichment is not negotiable,\" he said. \nSaturday's talks in Rome come amid a flurry of diplomatic activity.\nSaudi Arabia's Defence Minister, Prince Khalid bin Salman, visited Tehran on Thursday, delivering a personal message from his father King Salman to Ayatollah Khamenei. He also met Iran's President, Masoud Pezeshkian.\nIran has warned that any US military action would be met with retaliation against American bases in the region - many of them hosted by Iran's Arab neighbours.\nAt the same time, Araghchi visited Moscow and handed a letter from Khamenei to Russian President Vladimir Putin.\nIran and Russia have strengthened their military ties since the start of the war in Ukraine, with Tehran accused of supplying drones to support Moscow's war effort.\nThe Russian parliament ratified a 20-year strategic partnership between Iran and Russia 10 days ago. However, the deal does not include a mutual defence clause.\nMeanwhile, IAEA chief Rafael Grossi completed a two-day visit to Tehran this week, meeting Iranian nuclear officials and the foreign minister in a bid to ease tensions and restore inspection protocols.\nSince Trump returned to office this year, Ayatollah Khamenei has consistently denounced negotiations with Washington.\n\"Negotiating with this administration is not logical, not wise, nor honourable,\" he said in a February speech, just two months before agreeing to the current round of talks.\nThe supreme leader's distrust stems from Trump's withdrawal from the nuclear deal, the \"maximum pressure\" campaign that followed, and the assassination of General Qassem Soleimani in a US strike in Iraq in 2020.\nAyatollah Khamenei expressed satisfaction with the first round of talks, saying it was \"implemented well\".\nBut he cautioned that he was \"neither overly optimistic nor overly pessimistic\".\nHe has also previously warned that Iran would retaliate in the event of strikes on its nuclear programme.\nSome officials, including his adviser Ali Larijani, have even said that Iran might be \"forced\" to acquire a nuclear weapon if attacked.\n\"We are not pursuing weapons, and we have no problem with IAEA oversight - even indefinitely. But if you resort to bombing, Iran will have no choice but to reconsider. That is not in your interest,\" Larijani told state TV earlier this month.\nEach side is pushing its own narrative about how the talks are being conducted.\nThe US says they are direct. Iran says they indirect, and that Oman is mediating by exchanging written notes.\nAfter the first round in Muscat, Araghchi acknowledged he had a brief exchange with Witkoff \"out of diplomatic courtesy\" after crossing paths.\nUS news website Axios, citing sources, reported the two chief negotiators spoke for up to 45 minutes.\nTehran prefers secrecy. Washington seeks publicity.\nAfter both sides put out positive statements about the first round, Iran's currency surged by 20%.\nIran's leadership is well aware of public discontent over the country's harsh economic conditions - and the potential for protests it may trigger.\nFor the Islamic Republic, the fear is not just over bombs - it's protests too.\nThe wartime Alien Enemies Act has been controversially used to deport Venezuelans to a mega-jail in El Salvador.\nThe accused gang members are being sent to a notorious jail in El Salvador under a 19th-Century law.\nWhat is happening with US bonds, why Donald Trump cares and how ordinary Americans could be affected. \nSen Chris Van Hollen returned from El Salvador and spoke about his time meeting with Kilmar Abrego Garcia.\nBBC Verify looks at the evidence behind allegations that the Salvadoran mistakenly deported to a mega-prison was a dangerous gang member.\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

      "summary": "China sits at the heart of Apple's supply chain - and has benefited hugely from it. Can they break up?",
      "content": "Every iPhone comes with a label which tells you it was designed in California.\nWhile the sleek rectangle that runs many of our lives is indeed designed in the United States, it is likely to have come to life thousands of miles away in China: the country hit hardest by US President Donald Trump's tariffs, now rising to 245% on some Chinese imports.\nApple sells more than 220 million iPhones a year and by most estimates, nine in 10 are made in China. From the glossy screens to the battery packs, it's here that many of the components in an Apple product are made, sourced and assembled into iPhones, iPads or Macbooks. Most are shipped to the US, Apple's largest market. \nLuckily for the firm, Trump suddenly exempted smartphones, computers and some other electronic devices from his tariffs last week. \nBut the comfort is short-lived.\nThe president has since suggested that more tariffs are coming: \"NOBODY is getting 'off the hook',\" he wrote on Truth Social, as his administration investigated \"semiconductors and the WHOLE ELECTRONICS SUPPLY CHAIN\".\nThe global supply chain that Apple has touted as a strength is now a vulnerability. \nThe US and China, the world's two biggest economies, are interdependent and Trump's staggering tariffs have upended that relationship overnight, leading to an inevitable question: who is the more dependent of the two?\nChina has hugely benefited from hosting assembly lines for one of the world's most valuable companies. It was a calling card to the West for quality manufacturing and has helped spur local innovation. \nApple entered China in the 1990s to sell computers through third-party suppliers.\nAround 1997, when it was on the verge of bankruptcy as it struggled to compete with rivals, Apple found a lifeline in China. A young Chinese economy was opening up to foreign companies to boost manufacturing and create more jobs. \nIt wasn't until 2001 though that Apple officially arrived in China, through a Shanghai-based trading company, and started making products in the country. It partnered with Foxconn, a Taiwanese electronic manufacturer operating in China, to make iPods, then iMacs and subsequently iPhones.\nAs Beijing began trading with the world - encouraged by the US no less - Apple grew its footprint in what was becoming the world's factory. \nBack then, China was not primed to make the iPhone. But Apple chose its own crop of suppliers and helped them grow into \"manufacturing superstars,\" according to supply chain expert Lin Xueping.\nHe cites the example of Beijing Jingdiao, now a leading manufacturer of high-speed precision machinery, which is used to make advanced components efficiently. The company, which used to cut acrylic, was not considered a machine tool-maker - but it eventually developed machinery to cut glass and became \"the star of Apple's mobile phone surface processing,\" Mr Lin says.\nApple opened its first store in the country in Beijing in 2008, the year the city hosted the Olympics and China's relationship with the West was at an all-time high. This soon snowballed to 50 stores, with customers queuing out of the door.\nAs Apple's profit margins grew, so did its assembly lines in China, with Foxconn operating the world's largest iPhone factory in Zhengzhou, which has since been termed \"iPhone City\".\nFor a fast-growing China, Apple became a symbol of advanced Western tech - simple yet original and slick.\nToday, most of Apple's prized iPhones are manufactured by Foxconn. The advanced chips that power them are made in Taiwan, by the world's largest chip manufacturer, TSMC. The manufacturing also requires rare earth elements which are used in audio applications and cameras. \nSome 150 of Apple's top 187 suppliers in 2024 had factories in China, according to an analysis by Nikkei Asia.\n\"There's no supply chain in the world that's more critical to us than China,\" Apple's CEO Tim Cook said in an interview last year. \nIn Trump's first term, Apple secured exemptions on the tariffs he imposed on China. \nBut this time, the Trump administration has made an example of Apple before it reversed tariffs on some electronics. It believes the threat of steep taxes will encourage businesses to make products in America instead.\n\"The army of millions and millions of human beings screwing in little screws to make iPhones - that kind of thing is going to come to America,\" Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said in an interview earlier this month.\nWhite House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt reiterated that last week: \"President Trump has made it clear America cannot rely on China to manufacture critical technologies such as semiconductors, chips, smartphones and laptops.\"\nShe added: \"At the direction of the president, these companies are hustling to onshore their manufacturing in the United States as soon as possible.\"\nBut many are sceptical of that. \nThe thought that Apple could move its assembly operation to the US is \"pure fantasy,\" according to Eli Friedman, who formerly sat on the firm's academic advisory board. \nHe says the company has been talking about diversifying its supply chain away from China since 2013, when he joined the board - but the US was never an option.\nMr Friedman adds that Apple didn't make much progress over the next decade but \"really made an effort\" after the pandemic, when China's tightly controlled Covid lockdowns hurt manufacturing output. \n\"The most important new locations for assembly have been Vietnam and India. But of course the majority of Apple assembly still takes place [in China].\"\nApple did not respond to the BBC's questions but its website says its supply chain spans \"thousands of businesses and more than 50 countries\". \nAny change to Apple's current supply chain status quo would be a huge blow for China, which is trying to kickstart growth post-pandemic.\nMany of the reasons that the country wanted to be a manufacturing hub for Western companies in the early 2000s ring true today - it creates hundreds of thousands of jobs, and gives the country a crucial edge in global trade.\n\"Apple sits at the intersection of US-China tensions, and tariffs highlight the cost of that exposure,\" says Jigar Dixit, a supply chain and operations consultant.\nIt might explain why China has not bowed to Trump's threats, retaliating instead with 125% levies on US imports. China has also imposed export controls on a range of critical rare earth minerals and magnets it has in stores, dealing a blow to the US.\nThere is no doubt the US tariffs still being levied on other Chinese sectors will hurt, though.\nAnd it's not just Beijing facing higher tariffs - Trump has made it clear he will target countries that are part of the Chinese supply chain. For instance Vietnam, where Apple has moved AirPods production, was facing 46% tariffs before Trump hit pause for 90 days, so moving production elsewhere in Asia is not an easy way out. \n\"All conceivable places for the huge Foxconn assembly sites with tens or hundreds of thousands of workers are in Asia, and all of these countries are facing higher tariffs,\" Mr Friedman says.\nSo what does Apple do now? \nThe company is fighting off stiff competition from Chinese firms as the government pushes for advanced tech manufacturing in a race with the US.\nNow that \"Apple has cultivated China's electronic manufacturing capabilities, Huawei, Xiaomi, Oppo and others can reuse Apple's mature supply chain,\" according to Mr Lin.\nLast year, Apple lost its place as China's biggest smartphone seller to Huawei and Vivo. Chinese people are not spending enough because of a sluggish economy and with ChatGPT banned in China, Apple is also struggling to retain an edge among buyers seeking AI-powered phones. It even offered rare discounts on iPhones in January to boost sales.\nAnd while operating under President Xi Jinping's increasingly close grip, Apple has had to limit the use of Bluetooth and Airdrop on its devices as the Chinese Communist Party sought to censor political messages that people were sharing. It weathered a crackdown on the tech industry that even touched Alibaba founder and multi-billionaire Jack Ma.\nApple has announced a $500bn (PS378bn) investment in the US, though that may not be enough to appease the Trump administration for long.\nGiven the several U-turns and the uncertainty around Trump's tariffs, more unexpected levies are expected - which could again leave the company with little manoeuvring room and even less time.\nMr Dixit says smartphone tariffs will not cripple Apple should they rear their head again, but regardless will add \"pressure - both operationally and politically\" to a supply chain that cannot be unwound quickly.\n\"Clearly the severity of the immediate crisis has been lessened,\" Mr Friedman adds, referring to last week's exemption for smartphones. \n\"But I really don't think this means Apple can relax.\"\nAdditional reporting by Fan Wang\nAlmost three in five teachers believe social media use has had a negative effect on behaviour in schools, according to a union poll. \nThe Yizhuang half marathon is the first time robots have raced alongside humans over such a distance.\nMinecraft players have spent about 15,000 hours in total on the project to build London and the UK\nThe influencer explains how she rebuilt her life after a podcast implicated her fiance had had an affair.\nArtists hit back on social media to warn artificial intelligence may be endangering their livelihoods.\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

      "content": "The ambitions of two generals and the interests of other states have led to the massacre of adults and children already forced to flee their homes\nSudan has begun its third year of civil war in the bleakest manner imaginable: mourning the massacre of hundreds of civilians and relief workers in displacement camps in Darfur. What began as a power struggle between generals has led to the killing of tens of thousands of people and widespread sexual and ethnic violence. The International Rescue Committee says the result is the biggest humanitarian crisis ever recorded: 640,000 people face catastrophic hunger. Basic services and infrastructure, already woefully inadequate, have been destroyed.\n\"One thing that has been consistent since day one,\" the Sudanese activist and commentator Dallia Mohamed Abdelmoniem observed this week, \"[is that] it's a war on civilians. Now, I think we've become so desensitised to it, that doesn't make much of a difference any more. There's no impact.\"\nAbdel Fattah al-Burhan, Sudan's army chief and de facto leader, and Mohamed Hamdan \"Hemedti\" Dagalo, head of the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) paramilitaries, had together ousted civilian leadership before turning on each other in April 2023. Their vicious battle has forced tens of millions to flee their homes. Both sides have committed war crimes, and the US has accused the RSF and allied militias of genocide in Darfur. Outside parties have fuelled the conflict: Egypt and Saudi Arabia have close ties to the Sudanese army, while the Sudanese government and others accuse the United Arab Emirates of arming the RSF, which it denies.\nLast month's recapture of Khartoum by the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) has done nothing to end the conflict: on Wednesday, the RSF declared the creation of a rival government. There can be no military solution to the war. Instead, there is a growing prospect of effective partition. Having retaken the capital, the army may be even less willing to negotiate and may conclude that it is not overly concerned with the fate of Darfur and its people. There is also alarm that Gen Burhan has decreasing control over his forces and is increasingly dependent on hardline Islamists, whom neither the SAF's Gulf backers nor the west want to see return to power. The country's ethnic divisions, too, are growing.\nThe suffering of Sudan also has disturbing implications for a region facing other significant stresses. The influx of refugees has strained the impoverished eastern provinces of Chad. South Sudan, itself on the verge of civil war, has been destabilised by the interruption to its oil exports (which transit via Sudan) as well as the arrival of so many fleeing the conflict. Meanwhile, tensions are flaring between neighbouring Ethiopia and Eritrea.\nYet Sudan remains largely ignored as atrocities mount. Many are disappointed that the UK, the UN security council member meant to take the lead on Sudan, has failed to prioritise the conflict. Even the modest aim of its conference in London on Tuesday - to persuade the Arab states involved to agree some basic diplomatic principles for future discussions - failed. Humanitarian support should be a more straightforward issue. Yet the UN appeal remains shockingly underfunded and hundreds of millions of dollars previously promised to Sudan have not materialised. USAID cuts have further hit relief work. Despite their suffering, Sudanese civilians are doing remarkable work to alleviate the suffering of others, running emergency kitchens and meeting other basic needs. The very least they deserve is backing for these essential efforts.\nDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

      "ml_hf_summary": "Sudan's civil war entered its third year with the massacre of civilians and relief workers in displacement camps. The conflict began as a power struggle between generals, Al-Burhan and Hemedti, which escalated into violence leading to the deaths of tens of thousands and widespread sexual and ethnic violence.  The International Rescue Committee estimates 640,000 people face starvation due to the ongoing crisis. Tensions have escalated with both sides accused of war crimes by the US, while Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE are implicated in fueling the conflict. The recapture of Khartoum by the SAF has not ended the fighting, and a growing prospect of partition is emerging.  The conflict's impact extends beyond Sudan, straining neighboring countries like Chad and South Sudan, and escalating tensions between Ethiopia and Eritrea. Despite the suffering of Sudanese civilians, international support for humanitarian efforts remains insufficient, with funding lagging and aid organizations facing cuts. \n"

      "summary": "Fears about unpredictable policy are prompting investors to question their faith in the US dollar.",
      "content": "Fears about unpredictable policy are prompting investors to question their faith in the US dollar.\nAmid the financial market fallout which followed Donald Trump's \"Liberation Day\" tariff announcement on April 2, the value of the US dollar has plunged.\nBut while United States stock markets have largely recovered since then, the greenback - which typically gains in value during periods of financial turbulence - has continued its downward trajectory.\nThis is because the severe nature of Trump's international trade policies has raised the possibility of a US recession later this year, denting demand for America's currency.\nTrump's tariff blitz is also forcing investors to confront the possibility that the dominance of the dollar might be fading, or even coming to an end.\n\"The world is facing a dollar confidence crisis as the repercussions of 'Liberation Day' continue to reverberate,\" Deutsche Bank analysts wrote in a recent note to clients.\nFor close to a century, the US has been the world's investment \"safe haven\". Dozens of countries still maintain a peg to the greenback, meaning their currency prices are correlated.\nBut investors are now starting to worry about the long-term safety of the dollar, and the consequences could be dramatic.\nOn April 2, the Trump administration unveiled punishing tariffs on imports from dozens of countries around the world, denting confidence in the world's largest economy and causing a selloff of US financial assets.\nMore than $5 trillion was erased from the value of the benchmark S&P 500 index of shares in the three days after \"Liberation Day\".\nUS Treasuries - long considered the archetypical safe investment - also saw selloffs, lowering their price and sending debt costs for the US government sharply higher.\nFaced with a revolt in the financial markets, Trump announced a 90-day pause on tariffs, except for exports from China, on April 9. But investors remain wary about holding dollar-linked assets.\nSo far in April, the dollar has fallen by 3 percent relative to a basket of other currencies to reach its lowest level in three years, compounding an almost 10 percent slide since the start of 2025.\n\"Investors have been selling US assets, and the value of the dollar has fallen,\" Karsten Junius, chief economist at Bank J Safra Sarasin told Al Jazeera.\n\"But the dollar hasn't gone up as much [as US equity prices since April 9] because there's been a loss of trust in US economic policymaking,\" he added.\nFor the past 80 years, the US dollar has held the status of primary reserve currency - foreign currencies held in significant quantities by the world's monetary authorities.\nIn large part, the dollar emerged as the commanding global currency due to the first and second world wars. As Europe and Japan descended into chaos, the US was making money.\nThen, in 1971, when Richard Nixon de-linked gold from the value of the US dollar, the greenback's role in supporting the global financial system grew. So did its demand.\nFollowing the \"Nixon shock\", most countries abandoned gold convertibility but didn't adopt market-determined exchange rates. Instead, they pegged their currencies to the dollar.\nOwing to its dominance in trade and finance, the dollar became the standard currency anchor. In the 1980s, for instance, many Gulf countries began pegging their currencies to the greenback.\nIts influence didn't stop there. While the US only accounts for one-quarter of global gross domestic product (GDP), 54 percent of world exports were denominated in dollars in 2023, according to the Atlantic Council.\nIts dominance in finance is even greater. About 60 per cent of all bank deposits are denominated in dollars, while nearly 70 percent of international bonds are quoted in the US currency.\nMeanwhile, 57 percent of the world's foreign currency reserves - assets held by central banks around the world - are held in dollars, according to the IMF.\nBut the dollar's reserve status is largely supported by confidence in the US economy, its financial markets and its legal system.\nTrump is changing that. \"He doesn't care about international norms,\" said Junius, and \"investors are beginning to realise they're over-exposed to US assets.\"\nIndeed, foreigners own $19 trillion of US equities, $7 trillion of US Treasuries and $5 trillion of US corporate bonds, according to Apollo Asset Management. That's roughly 30 percent of global GDP.\nIf even some of these investors start to trim their positions, the dollar's value could come under sustained pressure.\nMany in the Trump team argue that the costs of the US dollar's reserve status outweigh the benefits by making it overvalued - raising the cost of US exports.\nStephen Miran, chair of Trump's Council of Economic Advisers, recently said that high dollar valuations place \"undue burdens on our firms and workers, making their products and labour uncompetitive on the global stage\".\n\"The dollar's overvaluation has been one factor contributing to the US's loss of competitiveness over the years, and... tariffs are a reaction to this unpleasant reality,\" he added.\nAt first blush, a lower dollar would make US goods cheaper to overseas buyers, supporting domestic manufacturing and helping to reduce the country's trade deficits.\n\"It will also make imports more expensive, hurting consumers,\" Colombia's former finance minister Jose Antonio Ocampo told Al Jazeera. \"The general view is that US inflation will increase.\n\"Elsewhere, the price of gold has also gone up,\" Ocampo said. \"It seems there's a growing preference among central banks to hold gold instead of US Treasuries.\"\nOcampo said that he also thinks that confidence in the dollar has taken a hit as a result of Trump's tariff announcements and that its selloff has been offset by gains for other safe-haven currencies.\nOn April 11, the euro hit a three-year high above $1.14 and has gained more than 5 percent on the dollar since the start of the month.\n\"For now, I think the dollar will remain the dominant global currency,\" said Ocampo.\nBut he also said that by weakening the US's economic foundations, Trump is undermining global dollar dominance. For his part, Ocampo mentioned two currencies that stand to benefit.\n\"We've seen inflows into the Swiss franc recently. But the euro is the real alternative to the dollar,\" he said.\nThe euro currently makes up 20 percent of international foreign exchange reserves - one-third of the dollar amount.\n\"If the EU can agree on closer fiscal union and, crucially, more integration across its financial markets, it will be the currency that could take on the mantle,\" Ocampo said. \n Follow Al Jazeera English:",
      "ml_hf_summary": "Following Donald Trump's \"Liberation Day\" tariff announcement on April 2nd, the value of the US dollar has declined. This decline is attributed to concerns about a potential US recession and the weakening of the dollar's global dominance. The tariffs have caused significant market volatility, with the S&P 500 index experiencing losses and US Treasuries seeing selloffs.  While the dollar has fallen against other currencies, it remains the world's primary reserve currency, supported by its historical role in international trade and finance. However, Trump's policies are causing a loss of confidence in US economic policymaking, leading to investors reducing their exposure to US assets. The euro is emerging as a potential alternative to the dollar, with increased demand for it from central banks seeking safe-haven currencies.  Despite this shift, the dollar is expected to remain dominant globally for now. \n"

      "summary": "Led by Jensen Huang, dubbed the 'Taylor Swift of tech', the chip giant has become pivotal in the race for AI supremacy.",
      "content": "Computer chip giant Nvidia has once again found itself at the centre of US-China tensions over trade and technology.\nOn Thursday Nvidia's chief executive Jensen Huang flew to Beijing to meet senior Chinese officials, just after the US imposed new export controls on its chips.\nThe California-based company will require licenses to export its H20 AI chip to China, a move which the US Commerce Department said was designed to safeguard \"national and economic security\". Nvidia said federal officials had told them the requirement will be in force for the \"indefinite future\".\nBut why is the company so pivotal in the race for AI supremacy between the US and China?\nNvidia designs advanced chips, or semiconductors, that are used in generative artificial intelligence. Generative AI can produce new content from a user's prompt, like ChatGPT.\nIn recent years, a surge in global demand for AI chips led Nvidia to become one of the world's most valuable companies. In November, Nvidia briefly unseated Apple as the largest company in the world by market capitalisation.\nBecause its chips are seen as so essential to advancements in generative AI, successive US administrations have scrutinised Nvidia's relationship with China.\nWashington hopes the new export controls will slow China's development of advanced AI chips - especially their use by the Chinese military - and secure an advantage in AI competition with Beijing.\nUS restrictions on Nvidia selling chips to China are not new.\nIn 2022, Joe Biden's administration imposed separate export controls on the sale of advanced semiconductors to China. Nvidia specifically designed the H20 chip to comply with those existing restrictions.\nA more powerful Nvidia chip, the H100, was already banned for sale in China.\nHowever, the recent emergence of DeepSeek, a Chinese generative AI company, has prompted fresh concerns in the US that even less powerful chips could lead to significant technological breakthroughs.\nDeepSeek claimed it could operate as effectively as other applications like ChatGPT using less advanced chips. \nNow, there is increasing demand for Nvidia's H20 chips among Chinese technology companies such as Tencent, Alibaba, and ByteDance, the parent company of TikTok.\nThose companies have outstanding orders for the chips. But because there is no grace period on the imposition of the new curbs, Nvidia expects to be hit by losses of $5.5bn (PS4.15bn) from these orders that it can no longer fulfil.\nChim Lee, a senior analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit in Beijing, told the BBC that there are alternative AI chips being developed in China, by companies like Huawei. \nAlthough they are currently viewed as inferior to Nvidia's, Mr Lee said the US curbs could prompt China to focus on developing better chips.\n\"It will introduce challenges to China's AI scene, but it won't massively slow down China's AI development and deployment,\" Mr Lee added.\nChina is a critical market for Nvidia. The world's second-largest economy accounted for 13% of its total sales last year, though that is still far less than the United States, which accounted for nearly half.\nThe timing of Mr Huang's trip is being seen as an effort to shore up Nvidia's business in China despite the latest curbs.\nIn his Beijing meeting with Ren Hongbin, head of the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, Mr Huang said he hoped \"to continue to cooperate with China\", according to state broadcaster CCTV.\nOn Thursday, the Financial Times reported that Mr Huang's trip to China also included a meeting with DeepSeek's founder, Liang Wenfeng.\nSeparately, top Chinese official He Lifeng told Mr Huang that \"China's market investment and consumption potential is huge\", according to state news agency Xinhua.\nDuring talks with Shanghai's mayor on Friday, Mr Huang said he was committed to the Chinese market, according to a Shanghai government statement.\nThe controls are part of Washington's broader goal to de-risk supply chains for advanced technology away from China, and bring more semiconductor production back to the US.\nNvidia this week announced plans to build up AI servers in the US worth up to $500bn. US president Donald Trump later claimed his re-election drove Nvidia's decision.\nAnd in March, Taiwanese semiconductor giant TSMC, which manufactures Nvidia's chips, announced it would invest an additional $100bn in advanced manufacturing facilities in Arizona.\nGary Ng, senior economist at Natixis, told the BBC the latest developments show that global technology is becoming increasingly polarised between \"two systems\", one dominated by the US and the other by China.\n\"Tech will be less global in that sense, and it will be subject to more restrictions.\"\nThe Yizhuang half marathon is the first time robots have raced alongside humans over such a distance.\nArtists hit back on social media to warn artificial intelligence may be endangering their livelihoods.\nThe charges will start in 180 days and rise in the coming years.\nSchools are developing different strategies for managing how students use AI technology.\nWriters are protesting over what they describe as \"any piracy\" of their works being used by Meta's AI model. \nCopyright 2025 BBC.

      "content": "The US has revealed plans to impose port fees on Chinese ships to try to revive shipbuilding in the US and challenge China's dominance of the industry.\nFrom mid-October, Chinese ship owners and operators will be charged $50 per ton of cargo with the fees increasing each year for the next three years.\nThere have been concerns that the measures would further disrupt global trade after US President Donald Trump's raft of tariff policies, but the fee is less severe than originally suggested.\nA spokesperson for the Chinese foreign ministry said the fees will raise prices for American consumers and \"will not revitalise the US shipbuilding industry\".\nThe US Trade Representative (USTR) said: \"China has largely achieved its dominance goals, severely disadvantaging US companies, workers, and the US economy\".\nFees on Chinese vessel owners and operators of ships built in China will be based on the weight of their cargo, how many containers they carry or the number of vehicles onboard.\nFor affected bulk vessels, the fee will be based on the weight of their cargo, while the charge for container ships will depend on how many containers a vessel is carrying.\nThe $50 per ton of cargo will rise by $30 a ton each year for the next three years. Fees on Chinese-built ships will start at $18 a ton or $120 per container and also rise over the next three years.\nNon-US built ships carrying cars will be charged $150 per vehicle.\nThe fee will be applied once per voyage on affected ships and not more than five times a year.\nThe USTR also decided not to impose fees based on how many Chinese-built ships are in a fleet or based on prospective orders of Chinese ships, as it had originally proposed.\nEmpty vessels that arrive at US ports to carry bulk exports like coal or grain are exempted.\nVessels that move goods between American ports as well as from those ports to Caribbean islands and US territories are also exempted from rules, as are US and Canadian ships that call at ports in the Great Lakes.\nThe fees are much lower than a plan floated in February to charge up to $1.5m (PS1.1m) for each American port a Chinese ship visits.\nThe USTR said a second phase of actions will begin in three years to favour US-built ships carrying liquified natural gas (LNG). These restrictions will rise incrementally over the following 22 years.\nThe announcement came as global trade is already being disrupted by Trump's trade tariffs, experts have said.\nCargoes originally destined for ports in the US from China are instead being redirected to European ports, a trade group said.\nBusinesses have warned this will raise prices for US consumers.\nSince returning to the White House in January, Trump has imposed taxes of up to 145% on imports from China. Other countries are facing a blanket US tariff of 10% until July.\nHis administration said this week that when the new tariffs are added on to existing ones, the levies on some Chinese goods could reach 245%.\nThese tariffs have caused \"significant build ups\" of ships, especially in the European Union, but also \"significant congestion\" at UK ports, according to Marco Forgione, director general of the Chartered Institute of Export & International Trade.\nMore containers are coming to the UK, he said.\n\"We've seen a lot of diversion of ships from China, that were due to head to the US, diverting and coming to the UK and into the EU.\"\nIn the first three months of 2025, Chinese imports into the UK have increased by about 15% and into the EU by about 12%.\n\"That's a direct impact of what President Trump is doing,\" he said, adding that uncertainty and increased disruption pushes up prices for consumers.\nSanne Manders, president of logistics firm Flexport, said both tariffs and strikes at ports in the Netherlands, Germany and Belgium in the first three months of the year had been \"clogging\" ports.\nCongestion in the UK \"is particularly severe in Felixstowe\", while in continental Europe Rotterdam and Barcelona are \"also pretty severe\".\n\"I do believe that if more cargo is going to be routed towards Europe, finding new buyers that will drive up the volumes even further, that could lead to more congestion,\" he said - although terminals would be open for more hours per day in the summer due to better weather.\nHe said shippers were looking for new markets, but that also there may be a surge of goods to the US to try to take advantage of that 90-day window for goods from some countries.\nHe said in the US, consumers would pay for the tariffs, but European consumers would not see \"much impact\".\nCompanies would also probably start redesigning their supply chains, he said.\nIranian and US officials agree to continue with a third round of high-stakes talks on a new nuclear deal.\nThe Yizhuang half marathon is the first time robots have raced alongside humans over such a distance.\nThe wartime Alien Enemies Act has been controversially used to deport Venezuelans to a mega-jail in El Salvador.\nThe accused gang members are being sent to a notorious jail in El Salvador under a 19th-Century law.\nWhat is happening with US bonds, why Donald Trump cares and how ordinary Americans could be affected. \nCopyright 2025 BBC.

However, they have caused alarm among US exporters.\nUS farmers have expressed dismay that an overly punitive fee structure would harm their ability to export goods by forcing ships to visit fewer American ports in an attempt to reduce the fees they have to pay.\nJamieson Greer, Donald Trump's trade representative, said in a statement that the US would charge fees to vessel owners and operators from China of $50 per net ton beginning in 180 days, increasing by $30 per net ton over the following three years. Operators of Chinese-built ships would be charged a lower amount.\n\"Ships and shipping are vital to American economic security and the free flow of commerce,\" said Greer. \n\"The Trump administration's actions will begin to reverse Chinese dominance, address threats to the US supply chain, and send a demand signal for US-built ships,\" he said.\nOne person in the shipping industry in China familiar with the matter said the new proposal represented a softening of the US trade representative's original proposal, which had raised the possibility of levying fees based on shipping operators' ownership of Chinese-built vessels in their fleets.\nThis would have meant all vessel operators would have been liable for fees just for owning Chinese ships.\nUnder the new proposals, non-Chinese owned shipping companies could avoid paying any port fees by using non-Chinese built vessels on US routes. Chinese shipping lines, however, would still be badly hit by the fees.\nChina's foreign ministry on Friday warned the US that \"measures such as imposing port fees . . . not only drive up global shipping costs\" and disrupt supply chains but would also \"increase inflationary pressure within the United States, harming American consumers and businesses\".\nRecommended\n\"These actions will not revive the US shipbuilding industry,\" the ministry said, adding that China would take \"necessary measures\" to protect its interests.\nGreer's office said the US would also impose \"limited restrictions\" on foreign vessels carrying liquefied natural gas, but restrictions would not begin for three years and would increase over a 22-year timeframe. \nThe fees would be based on the number of voyages to the US, and not applied for each port in the country visited on the same trip, reducing the risk that ships would skip smaller ports and harm US exporters. \nThe US trade representative's office added that empty ships arriving to export goods from the country would not be charged.\nAdditional reporting by Nian Liu in Beijing",
      "ml_hf_summary": "The Trump administration will impose fees on Chinese-built ships docking in US ports, starting with a $50 per net ton charge and increasing over three years. This move aims to boost US shipbuilding while pressuring China on unfair trade practices. The fees are expected to increase shipping costs for Chinese companies and potentially disrupt supply chains.  China has condemned the proposal, warning of increased inflationary pressure and potential disruptions to global trade. The US will also impose limited restrictions on foreign vessels carrying liquefied natural gas over a 22-year timeframe. \n"

      "content": "Block on removal of migrants without due process sets up the possibility of another challenge by the Trump administration to the power of the courts.\nThe United States Supreme Court has ordered a temporary halt on the deportation of two Venezuelan men using the antique wartime law invoked previously by the administration of President Donald Trump to send hundreds of people to El Salvador.\nThe country's top court issued the order to pause the deportation of the men in immigration custody early on Saturday, after their lawyers filed an urgent petition citing an imminent risk of removal without due process. The ruling sets up the possibility of another challenge by the Trump administration to the power of the courts, and even a full-blown constitutional crisis.\n\"The Government is directed not to remove any member of the putative class of detainees from the United States until further order of this Court,\" the justices wrote in an unsigned order.\nTwo of the nine justices on the Supreme Court, conservatives Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito, dissented from the decision.\nThe court issued the ruling following an emergency appeal filed by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), contending that immigration authorities appeared to be moving to restart removals under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798.\nTrump's use of the wartime legislation, last used during World War II, to deport alleged members of Venezuela's Tren de Aragua gang by claiming they are \"conducting irregular warfare\" in the US has prompted a vigorous debate over the constitution's ability to rein in executive power.\nThe Supreme Court had said in April that deportations could proceed only if those about to be removed had a chance to argue their case in court and were given \"a reasonable time\" to contest their pending removals.\n\"We are deeply relieved that the Court has temporarily blocked the removals. These individuals were in imminent danger of spending the rest of their lives in a brutal Salvadoran prison without ever having had any due process,\" ACLU lawyer Lee Gelernt said in an email to The Associated Press.\nThe White House has not yet commented on the ruling. \n Two federal judges had refused to intervene to stop the latest deportation proceedings, and the US 5th Circuit Court of Appeals has yet to act, prompting the ACLU to file a petition directly with the Supreme Court.\nAccording to the ACLU, some of the men had already been loaded onto buses and were told they were to be deported.\nDuring a hearing on Friday, a government lawyer had said he was unaware of plans by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to deport the men that day, but there could be deportations on Saturday.\n\"I've spoken with DHS. They are not aware of any current plans for flights tomorrow, but I have also been told to say they reserve the right to remove people tomorrow,\" Justice Department lawyer Drew Ensign told a district court in a separate but related case.\nIn March, the Trump administration deported 238 alleged Venezuelan gang members and 23 members of a Salvadoran gang to a maximum-security prison in El Salvador.\nThe deportations took place despite a US federal judge granting a temporary suspension of the expulsions.\nAmong those deported was Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a resident of the US State of Maryland, who had secured a protection order preventing the process from going ahead.\nThe Trump administration later acknowledged that it had wrongly deported Garcia, but has refused to abide by a separate Supreme Court order to return him to the US.\nDemocratic Senator Chris Van Hollen, who met with Garcia in El Salvador on Thursday, said as he returned to the US that it's \"very clear that the president\" is \"blatantly, flagrantly ... defying the order from the Supreme Court\".\n\"This case is not only about one man, as important as that is. It is about protecting fundamental freedoms and the fundamental principle in the constitution for due process that protects everybody who resides in America,\" Van Hollen said. \n Follow Al Jazeera English:",

Two conservative justices dissented from the ruling, and the decision sets up the possibility of further legal challenges to executive power. This follows a previous instance where the Trump administration deported 238 alleged Venezuelan gang members to El Salvador despite a federal judge's temporary suspension order. The ACLU argues that these deportations violate due process rights, while the White House has not yet commented on the ruling.  \n"

Chris Van Hollen returned from his trip to El Salvador Friday after meeting with Kilmar Abrego Garcia, the man who was deported due to an administrative error. \nVan Hollen traveled to El Salvador on Wednesday, April 16, to check on Abrego Garcia's health and well-being, a month after he was deported to a Salvadoran supermax prison known as CECOT.\n\"His conversation with me was the first communication that he had with anybody outside of prison since he was abducted. He said he felt very sad about being in a prison because he had not committed any crimes,\" Van Hollen said. \nHowever, he said, Abrego Garcia has since been moved to another prison where he says the conditions are better.\n\"He told me, and this was yesterday, eight days ago, so nine days ago from today, he was moved to another detention center in Santa Ana, where the conditions are better. But he said, despite the better conditions, he still has no access to any news from the outside world and no ability to communicate with anybody in the outside world,\" Van Hollen said.\nVan Hollen said he asked Abrego Garcia how he was dealing with his circumstances. \n\"He said that thinking of you, members of his family, is what gave him history to persevere, to keep going day to day, even under these awful circumstances,\" Van Hollen recounted.\nDuring their conversation, Abrego Garcia described his experience in CECOT.\nAbrego Garcia said that after he was detained by ICE officials, he was taken to a Baltimore detention center, where he was denied a phone call. He was then moved again to another facility in Texas before being put on a plane to El Salvador.\n\"I don't know whether it was period hours or days, he was handcuffed, shackled, and put on a plane, along with some others, where they couldn't see out of the windows. There was no way to see where they were going in the plane, they didn't know for sure where they were going. They landed in El Salvador,\" Van Hollen said.\nAfter arriving at the prison, Abrego Garcia was placed in a cell with about 25 other prisoners. \n\"The government in this case, the Trump administration, is asserting a right to stash away residents of this country in foreign prisons without a semblance of due process that is the foundation of our constitutional order,\" Sen. Van Hollen said. \"He was traumatized by being at CECOT and fearful of many of the prisoners in other cell blocks who called out to him and taunted him in various ways, he told me.\" \nDuring his trip, Van Hollen initially faced challenges when trying to coordinate a meeting with Abrego Garcia.\nOn the first day of his trip, the senator met with Salvadoran Vice President Felix Ulloa, who denied Van Hollen's request for a meeting or phone call with Abrego Garcia. \n\"When I met with the vice president of El Salvador, I asked him not to be complicit in the Trump administration's law-breaking in the United States of America and to release Mr. Abrego Garcia,\" Van Hollen said during a news conference.\nOn Thursday morning, Van Hollen said he had been turned away from a military checkpoint near CECOT by soldiers who had been ordered not to let him proceed. \nHowever, on Thursday evening, the senator confirmed he met with Abrego Garcia, sharing a photo of their meeting at what appeared to be a restaurant. \n\"I have called his wife, Jennifer, to pass along his message of love,\" Van Hollen said in a social media post. \nThe president of El Salvador Nayib Bukele shared photos of the meeting as well, saying Abrego Garcia, \"gets the honor of staying in El Salvador's custody.\" \nThe trip has not come without backlash from Republicans.\nWith members of the White House calling Van Hollen's trip \"disgusting,\" and President Trump standing by the decision to deport Abrego Garcia, despite orders from the Supreme Court to facilitate his return.\n\"This man is a, according to certified statements that we get, is a very violent person, and they want this man to be brought back into our country where he can be free. They call him the Maryland man, he's a Maryland father. No, he's a violent person,\" President Trump said.\nAbrego Garcia is an El Salvador native who entered the U.S. illegally in 2011.\nHe was taken into custody by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents in March as he was leaving his job in Baltimore. \nHe and about 200 other migrants were transported to CECOT in El Salvador by plane at the direction of the Trump administration. \nHis deportation sparked a legal battle as he was under a protection order granted by an immigration judge in 2019. The \"withholding of removal\" order should have prevented him from being deported to El Salvador. \nICE officials admitted in a court filing that Abrego Garcia's deportation occurred because of an administrative error, though they did not move to correct the mistake. \nThe legal proceedings are still playing out in federal court after the Trump administration was ordered by a federal judge and later by the Supreme Court to facilitate Abrego Garcia's return to the U.S. \nAbrego Garcia does not have a criminal history. \nThe Trump administration continues to claim that Abrego Garcia is a member of the transnational MS-13 gang. Abrego Garcia's attorney and family have denied the allegations. \n\"They are trying to make this case all about MS-13, when in fact, the judge in the case has said they have not provided substantial or any significant evidence to back up their claim,\" Van Hollen said Thursday. \nThe allegations of Abrego Garcia's connection to MS-13 stem from his arrest in 2019. Court documents show that Abrego Garcia was arrested outside of a Home Depot with three other men, at least two of whom had suspected gang ties. \nAccording to his attorney, Abrego Garcia was soliciting work outside of the store when police showed up and began questioning the men about gang affiliations. \nAccording to the court documents shared by Attorney General Pam Bondi, a detective recognized one of the men in the group as an MS-13 gang member with a criminal history. \nDetectives indicated in their report that a second man had tattoos that were \"indicative of the Hispanic gang culture.\" \nAfter interviewing Abrego Garcia, police noted that he was wearing a Chicago Bulls hat and hoodie with symbols that they said were also indicative of gang culture. A source police had previously used also reported that Abrego Garcia was an active MS-13 member, according to court documents. \nHe was subsequently arrested and he later appeared in court, where a U.S. immigration judge granted him the \"withholding of removal\" order and a work permit. \n (c) 2025 CBS Broadcasting Inc.

      "content": "The order is the latest example of how the courts are challenging the Trump administration's overhaul of the immigration system\nThe US supreme court has ordered the Trump administration to temporarily halt the deportation of Venezuelan men in immigration custody, after their lawyers said they were at imminent risk of removal without the judicial review previously mandated by the justices.\n\"The government is directed not to remove any member of the putative class of detainees from the United States until further order of this court,\" the justices said early on Saturday.\nJustices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito, two of the court's leading conservatives, dissented.\nThe order is the latest example of how the country's courts are challenging the Trump administration's overhaul of the immigration system, which has been characterized by a number of deportations that have either been wrongful or carried out without due process.\nBefore the late-night supreme court ruling, lawyers for the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) argued in an emergency Friday court filing that dozens of Venezuelan men held in Immigration and Customs Enforcement's Bluebonnet detention center in Texas were given notices indicating they were classified as members of the Tren de Aragua gang. They said the men would be deported under the Alien Enemies Act (AEA), and were told \"that the removals are imminent and will happen tonight or tomorrow\".\nThe ACLU said immigration authorities were accusing other Venezuelan men held there of being members of the Tren de Aragua gang that would make them subject to deportation. The ACLU said a number of the men in Texas had already been loaded on a bus, and it urged the court to rule before they could be deported.\nThe ACLU has already sued to block deportations under the AEA of two Venezuelans held in the Texas detention center and is asking a judge to issue an order barring removals of any immigrants in the region under the law.\nThe supreme court has allowed some deportations under the AEA, but has previously ruled they could proceed only if those about to be removed had a chance to argue their case in court and were given \"a reasonable time\" to contest their pending removals.\nFederal judges in Colorado, New York and southern Texas have also issued orders barring the removal of detainees under the AEA until the administration provides a process for them to make claims in court. But there's been no such order issued in the area of Texas that covers Bluebonnet, which is located 24 miles north of the city of Abilene in the far northern end of the state.\nDistrict judge James Wesley Hendrix this week declined to bar the administration from removing the two men identified in the ACLU lawsuit because immigration officials filed sworn declarations that they would not be immediately deported.\nBut the ACLU's Friday filing includes sworn declarations from three separate immigration lawyers who said their clients in Bluebonnet were given paperwork indicating they were members of Tren de Aragua and could be deported by Saturday.\nIn one case, immigration lawyer Karene Brown said her client, identified by initials and who only spoke Spanish, was told to sign papers in English.\n\"Ice informed FGM that these papers were coming from the president, and that he will be deported even if he did not sign it,\" Brown wrote.\nThe ACLU asked Hendrix to issue a temporary order halting any such deportations. Later on Friday, with no response from Hendrix, the ACLU asked district judge James Boasberg in Washington to issue a similar emergency order, saying they had information that detainees were being loaded on buses.\nIn their court filing, lawyers say clients received a document on Friday from immigration officials, titled \"Notice and Warrant of Apprehension and Removal Under the Alien Enemies Act\".\nIt reads: \"You have been determined to be ... a member of Tren de Aragua.\"\n\"You have been determined to be an alien enemy subject to apprehension, restraint and removal from the United States ... This is not a removal under the Immigration and Nationality Act,\" the notice reads.\nBefore the supreme court decision, Pramila Jayapal, a Washington Democrat, denounced the reported plan. \"We cannot stand by,\" Jayapal wrote on social media, as the Trump administration \"continues to disappear people\".\nHours before the supreme court ruling was announced, an appeals court in Washington DC temporarily halted Judge Boasberg's contempt proceedings against the Trump administration over its deportation flights to El Salvador last month.\nThe court said the order is intended to provide \"sufficient opportunity\" for the court to consider the government's appeal and \"should not be construed in any way as a ruling on the merits of that motion\".",
      "ml_hf_summary": "The US Supreme Court ordered the Trump administration to halt deportations of Venezuelan men held in ICE custody until further order. The court's decision follows an emergency filing by the ACLU, which argued that these men were being wrongly classified as members of the Tren de Aragua gang and facing imminent deportation without judicial review.  The ACLU claims that many detainees received notices indicating they would be deported under the Alien Enemies Act (AEA) despite not having a chance to contest their removal in court. The Supreme Court's ruling follows similar orders from federal judges in Colorado, New York, and Texas, but not in the area of Texas where the Bluebonnet detention center is located.  The ACLU has also filed a lawsuit seeking a nationwide injunction against deportations under the AEA. \n"

However, Mr Garcia's attorneys say the government has provided no evidence, and he has never been charged with any crime related to such activity.\nEarlier this week, Maryland senator, Mr Van Hollen, flew to El Salvador and met with Mr Garcia in an effort to help secure his return to America.\nSpeaking to reporters at Washington Dulles International airport after returning to the US on Friday, Mr Van Hollen said: \"As the federal courts have said, we need to bring Mr Abrego Garcia home to protect his constitutional rights to due process. And it's also important that people understand this case is not just about one man.\n\"It's about protecting the constitutional rights of everybody who resides in the United States of America.\"\nMr Van Hollen added the Trump administration is \"asserting a right to stash away residents of this country\" in foreign prisons \"without the semblance of due process that is the foundation of our constitutional order\".\nNews correspondent\nWhat began as the plight of a Salvadoran man wrongly deported from the US to a notorious high-security prison in El Salvador has become a much broader debate.\nThe case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia now ranges from the extremely serious - questions over the rule of law, due process and a potential constitutional crisis - to the more curious matter of tequila-based cocktails.\nThere is a public relations battle going on over the images which emerged of Mr Abrego Garcia meeting Maryland Senator Chris van Hollen at a hotel in San Salvador.\nIn the first photos which were made public, on the social media account of El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele, an ally of Donald Trump, the two men had cocktail glasses in front of them which he said were margaritas.\nBut when Senator van Hollen posted his account of the meeting, those glasses had vanished. So what's this all about, and why does it matter?\nThe senator has now given his version of events, saying the glasses were placed there by an El Salvador government official to mock concerns about the conditions in the country's prison - a photo op aimed at shifting the narrative around Mr Abrego Garcia's detention in El Salvador.\nMr van Hollen also revealed El Salvador officials initially wanted the meeting to take place next to a swimming pool, to give an even more tropical backdrop to the encounter.\nBut at the end of the day, it's not just about images, it's not about public relations, it's not even about margaritas. It's about a 29-year-old father of three, detained in El Salvador, despite having never gone through due process in the US.\nThe senator also revealed Mr Garcia was brought from a detention centre to his hotel after initial requests to meet or speak with him were denied.\nMr Van Hollen said Mr Garcia told him he was \"traumatised\" after being detained at El Salvador's notorious CECOT prison, but he had been moved to a \"different facility\" with better conditions nine days ago.\nThe senator said Mr Garcia told him he was worried about his family and that thinking about them was giving him \"the strength to persevere\" and to \"keep going\" under awful circumstances. Mr Garcia's wife, Jennifer, was at the news conference and wiped away tears as Mr Van Hollen spoke of her husband's desire to speak to her.\nEarlier, Mr Van Hollen had posted photos of himself meeting with Mr Garcia.\nIt came before El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele shared his own images of the meeting, which he claimed showed the pair \"sipping margaritas\" in the \"tropical paradise of El Salvador\".\nMr Van Hollen said photos of them with margaritas were staged by officials working for the country's president.\nIn an apparent sarcastic remark, Mr Bukele wrote that Mr Garcia had \"miraculously risen\" from the \"death camps\".\nGiving an account of what he says happened when the photos were taken, Mr Van Hollen said: \"We just had glasses of water on the table. I think maybe some coffee.\n\"And as we were talking, one of the government people came over and deposited two other glasses on the table with ice. And I don't know if it was salt or sugar round the top, but they looked like margaritas.\n\"If you look at the one they put in front of Kilmer, it actually had a little less liquid than the one in me in front of me to try to make it look, I assume like he drank out of it.\n\"Let me just be very clear. Neither of us touched the drinks that were in front of us.\"\nBe the first to get Breaking News\nInstall the Sky News app for free\nHe added that people can tell he is telling the truth because if someone had sipped from one of the glass there would be a \"gap\" where the \"salt or sugar\" had disappeared.\nMr Van Hollen said the image shows the \"lengths\" the El Salvadorian president will go to \"deceive people about what's going on\".\n\"It also shows the lengths that the Trump administration and [President Trump] will go to, because when he was asked by a reporter about this, he just went along for the ride.\"\nOn 15 March, the Trump administration deported more than 130 alleged Tren de Aragua members to El Salvador. Many of the migrants' lawyers and family members say they were not gang members and had no chance to dispute the government's assertion that they were.",

The government alleges he is a member of the MS-13 gang - something his lawyers deny.\nAlthough a judge has ordered his return, the Trump administration says he is outside their jurisdiction and that the decision on whether he is returned is solely up to El Salvador.\nWhat does an 18th-century wartime law have to do with it?\nThe Trump administration invoked the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to deport immigrants they identified as criminals, regardless of their immigration status.\nThe act has only been invoked three times in US history, most recently during the Second World War to hold Japanese-American civilians in internment camps.\nOn 9 April the Supreme Court ruled the law could be used by the Trump administration to deport Venezuelan immigrants it accused of being gang members - but only with a court hearing.\nThe American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) said migrants were not being given the opportunity to challenge the orders, and asked the Supreme Court to urgently intervene.\nOn 18 April, the Supreme Court temporarily blocked the removal of Venezuelan migrants from northern Texas after the ACLU reported some of the men had been loaded onto buses and were told they would be deported without due process.\nThe White House has yet to comment on the Supreme Court's latest ruling.\nMr Trump has previously said he supports the removal of \"bad people\".\nWhere are people being deported to?\nSome countries - including Venezuela - do not accept deportations from the United States.\nThis has led the Trump administration to strike agreements with other countries - including El Salvador, Honduras, Costa Rica and Panama - to take migrants.\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player \n Other challenges to the deportation drive\nHuman rights lawyers are suing Costa Rica, alleging the Central American nation violated the rights of dozens of migrant children - some as young as two - by detaining them in a rural camp for nearly two months after they were deported from America in February.\nThe children are part of a group of hundreds of migrants from mostly Asian countries, including Afghanistan, China, and Russia.\nWhile Costa Rica and Panama were originally intended as a kind of deportation layover, the migrants have now spent 50 days in limbo.\nThe same group of lawyers have filed a similar case against Panama, which was holding migrants in hotels and in remote camps near the Darien Gap, where deportees said they were stripped of their phones.\nSharp criticisms prompted the Panamanian government to release the migrants on the streets of Panama City last month, leaving many migrants to fend for themselves.\n Follow Trump 100 on your podcast app \nWhat do the statistics say?\nFollowing Mr Trump's return to the White House, data from Customs and Border Protection shows unauthorised crossings at the southern border have plummeted.\nMeanwhile, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) deportations have doubled, and the number of people in detention is at an all-time high, according to Sky News' US partner, NBC News.\nBut it's worth noting that despite Mr Trump's efforts, data obtained by NBC News shows the Trump administration's deportations during his first full month in office were running slightly behind deportations under Joe Biden at the same time last year.",

This ruling follows a surge in deportations since Trump's presidency began, including over 130 alleged Venezuelan gang members deported to El Salvador's CECOT supermax prison.  The Trump administration has also struck deportation agreements with other countries like El Salvador, Honduras, Costa Rica and Panama, but these have faced legal challenges, such as a lawsuit alleging the detention of migrant children in Costa Rica for nearly two months. Despite efforts to increase deportations, data from Customs and Border Protection shows unauthorized crossings at the southern border have decreased, while ICE deportations have doubled and detention numbers are at an all-time high. \n"

      "content": "An Indian archaeologist, whose career was marked by brilliance and controversy, made one of the world's greatest historical discoveries. Yet he remains largely forgotten today.\nIn the early 1900s, Rakhaldas Banerjee (also spelled Banerji) unearthed Mohenjo-daro - meaning \"mound of the dead men\" in the Sindhi language - in present-day Pakistan. It was the largest city of the thriving Indus Valley (Harappan) Civilisation, which stretched from north-east Afghanistan to north-west India during the Bronze Age.\nBanerjee, an intrepid explorer and talented epigraphist, worked for the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) when the country was under British colonial rule. He spent months travelling to distant corners of the subcontinent, looking for ancient artefacts, ruins and scripts.\nBut while his discovery of Mohenjo-daro was ground-breaking, Banerjee's legacy is clouded by disputes. His independent streak and defiance of colonial protocols often landed him in trouble - tainting his reputation and perhaps even erasing parts of his contribution from global memory.\nInterestingly, Banerjee's reports on Mohenjo-daro were never published by the ASI. Archaeologist PK Mishra later accused then ASI chief John Marshall of suppressing Banerjee's findings and claiming credit for the discovery himself.\n\"The world knows Marshall discovered the civilisation's ruins and it is taught in institutions. Banerjee is an insignificant footnote,\" Prof Mishra told the Times of India newspaper. \nIn her book, Finding Forgotten Cities: How the Indus Civilization Was Discovered, historian Nayanjot Lahiri writes that Banerjee \"lacked diplomacy and tact and displayed a high-handedness that ruffled feathers\". Her book also sheds light on the controversies he was embroiled in during his time at the ASI.\nShe notes how once, he attempted to procure inscriptions and images from a museum in north-east India without the approval or knowledge of his boss. \nAnother time, Banerjee attempted to relocate some stone sculptures from a museum in Bengal to the one he was stationed at without the necessary permissions. \nIn another instance, he purchased an antique painting for a sum without consulting his superiors who thought he'd paid more than was necessary.\n\"Banerjee's many talents seemed to include being always able to rub people the wrong way,\" Lahiri writes.\nBut Banerjee remains a prominent figure among world historians and scholars in Bengal because of his connection with Mohenjo-daro. \nHe was born in 1885 to a wealthy family in Bengal.\nThe medieval monuments that dotted Baharampur, the city he grew up in, kindled his interest in history and he pursued the subject in college. But he always had an adventurous streak.\nOnce, when he was tasked with writing an essay about the Scythian period of Indian history, he travelled to a museum in a neighbouring state to study first-hand sculptures and scripts from that era.\nIn her book, The Life and Works of Rakhaldas Banerji, author Yama Pande notes how Banerjee joined the ASI as an excavation assistant in 1910 and rose quickly within the ranks to become a superintending archaeologist in western India in 1917.\nIt was in this post that he first set eyes on Mohenjo-daro in Sindh in 1919. In the following years, he conducted a series of excavations at the site that revealed some of the most fascinating finds: ancient Buddhist stupas, coins, seals, pots and microliths.\nBetween 1922 and 1923, he discovered several layers of ruins that held clues about various urban settlements that had emerged in the region, but most importantly, the oldest one that had existed some 5,300 years ago - the Indus Valley Civilisation. \nAt that time, historians had not yet discovered the full scale of the Indus Civilisation which, we now know, covered an expanse of approximately 386,000 sq miles (999,735 sq km) along the Indus river valley.\nThree seals from Banerjee's excavation bore images and scripts similar to those from Harappa in the Punjab province in present-day Pakistan. This helped establish a link between the two sites, shedding light on the vast reach of the Indus Valley civilisation. \nBut by 1924, Banerjee's funds for the project had dried up and he was also transferred to eastern India. He had no further contact with the site, nor did he participate in any excavations there, Pande writes in her book.\nBut Nayanjot Lahiri notes that Banerjee was transferred at his own request, after becoming entangled in questions over his spending. He had failed to account for several job-related expenses.\nIt was also revealed that Banerjee had used excavation grants to buy office furniture and his travel expenses were deemed excessive.\nHis explanations failed to convince his superiors and disciplinary action was recommended. After some negotiation, Banerjee was granted his request and transferred to another region.\nBanerjee continued to work with the ASI in eastern India. He spent most of his time in Calcutta (now Kolkata) and oversaw the restoration work of many important monuments.\nHe resigned from the ASI in 1927, but his departure was marred by controversy. In the years prior to his departure, he became the prime suspect in a case of idol theft.\nIt all started in October 1925, when Banerjee had visited a revered Hindu shrine in Madhya Pradesh state that housed a stone idol of a Buddhist goddess. Banerjee was accompanied by two low-ranking assistants and two labourers, Lahiri notes in her book.\nHowever, following their visit, the idol went missing, and Banerjee was implicated in its theft. He denied any involvement in the disappearance and an investigation was launched.\nThe idol was later recovered in Calcutta. Though the case against Banerjee was dismissed and the charges were found to be unsubstantiated, Marshall insisted on his resignation.\nAfter leaving the ASI, Banerjee worked as a professor, but faced financial difficulties because of his lavish lifestyle.\nHistorian Tapati Guha-Thakurta told the Telegraph newspaper that Banerjee splurged on good food, horse carriages and friends. In 1928, he joined the Banaras Hindu University (BHU) as a professor. He died just two years later at the age of 45.\nFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.\nModi said he discussed with Musk India's potential to collaborate with the US on technology.\nHarpreet Singh is wanted by Indian authorities for his alleged role in terror attacks in Punjab state.\nOla, once a rising star, is facing falling sales amid rising competition and regulatory scrutiny. \nThe company has halted taxi bookings after allegations of fund diversion by India's market regulator.\nThe visit comes as India and US continue high-stakes talks to finalise a bilateral trade deal. \nCopyright 2025 BBC.

The WHO says the emergency room, laboratory, X-ray machines and pharmacy were destroyed.\n\"I started my treatment at al-Shifa hospital, then I got transferred to al-Ahli and they bombed it,\" says Saeed Barkat, an older man with a fractured thigh bone, who arrives at the MSF clinic on crutches.\nHe had surgery after he was wounded by Israeli artillery fire on the shelter where he was staying late last year. He has pins in his leg, and it is swollen.\n\"I came here for any treatment and to follow-up,\" says Mr Barkat, as nurses change his dressing and give new painkillers.\nAt midday, when Dr Sukkar checks on the small pharmacy at the clinic, she looks worried. Many of the shelves are bare.\nIsrael closed all crossings to Gaza at the start of March, saying it was putting pressure on Hamas to release the remaining hostages it is holding. Since then, no aid has entered.\n\"For diabetes, we don't have insulin, we don't have treatments for epilepsy, we don't have basic medicines like anti-fever drugs,\" Dr Sukkar says.\n\"It's the season for skin infections and we don't have creams or ointments for bacterial infections, no medicines to treat scabies and head lice.\"\nThe doctors are rationing the supplies that remain.\n\"We are doing our best so that it will be enough for the coming week,\" sums up Dr Sukkar, \"but we expect that our stock will run out in more or less two weeks.\"\nSoon Dr Sukkar is back in her consultation room. The rush of patients continues with many more sick children. They have coughs, fevers and stomach upsets.\nBy 15:30, it is time to close up the clinic for the day. The four doctors here calculate that they have seen nearly 390 patients.\nAfter a long, tiring day, there is the long, tiring walk home for Dr Sukkar.\nAs she leaves the clinic she telephones her family. Her thoughts turn to looking after her own children, who have been displaced with her nine times in the past year and a half.\n\"Like every Gazan, I have a daily struggle to secure clean water, food for my kids,\" says Dr Sukkar. \"We don't have electricity, so it's really hard even to charge the battery of my mobile.\"\n\"Most of all, it's really hard to have any hope,\" she goes on. \"I feel I live in a nightmare that doesn't end. When will this war end?\"\nFor now, there is no answer, and no respite.\nHigh-profile detentions and visa revocations are putting students on edge, as Trump tightens his squeeze on US schools.\nWitnesses in al-Mawasi told the BBC that people were burned alive as tents were engulfed in flames.\nThe group says it wants a deal that would free all hostages in return for an end to the war.\nThe president of the Board of Deputies says he disagrees with the letter criticising the war in Gaza.\nThirty-six members of the largest body representing Jews in the UK warn \"Israel's soul is being ripped out\".\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

      "ml_hf_summary": "Healthcare in Gaza has been severely impacted by the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas, with only 21 out of 36 hospitals functioning.  A Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) clinic in northern Gaza is operating under extreme conditions, serving a large influx of displaced patients suffering from malnutrition, diseases like scabies and viral infections, and burns due to the use of open fires for cooking. The clinic's supplies are critically low due to Israel's blockade of Gaza, with insulin, anti-fever drugs, and other essential medications unavailable.  The closure of all crossings into Gaza has further exacerbated the situation, hindering the delivery of aid and medical supplies.  Dr. Wissam Sukkar, a GP at the clinic, reports that her team is struggling to cope with the overwhelming number of patients and limited resources, facing challenges in referring complex cases due to the collapsed health system. \n"

      "content": "Artists and creatives are pushing back against a recent trend using artificial intelligence (AI) to generate \"starter pack\" images of people as toys - which they say may be in danger of risking their livelihoods.\nSince the start of April, thousands of people have uploaded their photos to generate images of themselves as dolls, despite warnings of damaging the environment, giving away personal information, and devaluing creativity.\nNick Lavallee, who has made custom action figures for six years, told the BBC he was concerned his work may be at risk after \"AI images saturated social media\".\n\"People are sick of them,\" he said. \"It's an artistic aesthetic - AI-generated art diminishes that.\"\nNick has made figures of - and for - comedians, film directors, and artists such as Weezer and Tyler Childers, which sell for as much as $250 (PS188) online on his Wicked Joyful website.\nHis success has led to a clothing brand and will soon be followed by a physical shop in his hometown of Manchester, New Hampshire.\nBut he's concerned action figure commissions could soon dry up, as well as the public perception of his work, from thousands of AI images mimicking his passion.\nThe feeling has been shared by other creatives with the rise of the #StarterPackNoAI movement, which has been used thousands of times since first appearing on Instagram in early April before spreading to X soon after.\nAfter Patouret's post, others quickly joined the counter-trend, with artist Maria Picasso Piquer saying she chose to take part \"for fun, but also as a statement\".\n\"While AI pieces all looked more or less the same, I was amazed at the variety of the 'human' works,\" she said.\n\"Plus, self-portraits added an extra layer of, well, humanity.\"\nMaria, like many other artists, sees the dual risk of AI images threatening intellectual property rights by being \"fed on 'stolen' art\", and the possibility of reducing her finding new clients.\nIllustrator Dav le Dessineux, working in Bordeaux, France, said some in his industry had already lost contracts to AI design work.\nHe contributed his starter pack because \"like many artists who use their real hands\", he was \"tired\" of the deluge of AI-generated doll images.\nDav's illustration featured only a pencil and sheet of white paper - tools he said are \"all you need to start being an artist\".\n\"People usually forget about it because of the technology surrounding us, but we really don't need more than basic stuff to create something and be original,\" he said.\nEli Dibitonto, an artist living in Barletta, Italy, agreed, describing the process of digitally illustrating his own starter pack as \"carefree and fun\".\n\"It doesn't have to be perfect - mine isn't,\" he said. \"Art isn't meant to be perfect or look flawless.\"\nAnd illustrator and student Evie Joyce said creating her own artwork meant being able to consider what to reflect of her personality during a process lasting several hours, rather than seconds.\n\"I think that what's so magical about it is you're seeing people put time and effort and their personality, all of their experiences, into pieces of art,\" she said.\n\"With AI, it can even steal from artists and steal their work and their style, it just loses that touch of personality.\"\nBack in New Hampshire, Nick understands the rebellion from illustrators, but says he believes there is use for AI.\n\"I don't necessarily want to say AI is bad when I know that it could be a useful tool,\" he said.\n\"I think all of us have experimented with it.\"\nAnd Henk van Ess, a global expert in using AI in investigative research, has proven how useful it can be - but it would be safe to say he does not believe it lies in starter packs.\n\"It's like watching a supercomputer calculate how many Hobnobs fit in a Sports Direct mug, while solving climate change sits on the 'to-do' list,\" he said.\n\"Technically impressive? Sure. But it's the technological equivalent of using the Large Hadron Collider to heat up your Pot Noodle.\n\"While everyone's busy generating these digital equivalents of small talk, they're missing the actually revolutionary stuff AI can do - it's just wasteful to put all that energy into creating digital fluff when we can use it for solving real-world problems.\"\nAnd Nick remains positive.\n\"The musicians who get my stuff, who are excited to hold a Wicked Joyful in their hands, they know it's my artwork, they know it's mine,\" he said.\nLikewise, Dav is confident in the worth of human work.\nDespite the rise of pre-fabricated furniture, he says, \"people still call on cabinetmakers\".\n\"I hope I'll be one of those artisans,\" he said.\nNick, who says he found his purpose \"in bringing joy to people\" with his creations, said he similarly wanted to remain hopeful about the future.\n\"I really hope people are totally sick of AI action figures,\" he said.\n\"But I hope that they are smart enough to understand the difference in something that I'm doing versus what is computer-generated.\"\nMax Corbett's street scenes are a mixture of photography and traditional oil painting techniques.\nMinecraft players have spent about 15,000 hours in total on the project to build London and the UK\nThe suspended light installation casts moving shadows, illuminating the church and forming halos.\nFrank Morris's sketches can take him anywhere between five and 10 hours to complete. \nThe influencer explains how she rebuilt her life after a podcast implicated her fiance had had an affair.\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

      "title": "Syrians have more freedom after Assad, but could they soon lose it?",
      "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cr4nqe3724vo",
      "published": "2025-04-18",
      "summary": "There are concerns around what democracy could look like and the role of Islam in the new regime.",
      "content": "Listen to Lina read this article\nOn the morning of 8 December 2024, I waited anxiously at the Lebanese border, hoping to get into Syria as soon as the crossing opened, not knowing what to expect.\nBashar al-Assad, the president of 24 years, was gone. Opposition fighters had advanced towards Damascus, taking major cities including Aleppo. I couldn't believe what I was seeing: Syria was free.\nLike many Syrians, I'd only ever known the country under the rule of Assad and his father Hafez, who had been in power from 1971 until 2000. Life under the Assads had meant more than 50 years of disappearances, incarceration - and the civil war that began in 2011 had claimed the lives of hundreds of thousands of Syrians.\nI'd been detained at the start of the uprising that year, and several times afterwards; I witnessed men lined up to be beaten and heard screams of torture. Even after I left the country in 2013, I learnt that security forces had broken into my apartment in Damascus and vandalised it.\nI assumed I'd lost my home country for good, then suddenly last year the dictatorship was toppled in just over a week. As I crossed the border into the country without fear of arrest, and watched rebel fighters shoot celebratory gunfire, while people rejoiced on the streets, I felt like laughing and crying at once.\nFor weeks, Damascus's main Umayyad Square became a hub of celebrations. Young and old talked freely about politics and everywhere Syria's future was debated openly; among street vendors and taxi drivers, boys cleaning shoes. All of this was unthinkable under Assad, as Syrians could never protest freely for fear of reprisals.\nOnly now, four months on, the situation is more complex. Though great strides have been made in gaining some social freedoms, there are growing concerns around what democracy will look like but also around the role of Islam in the new regime.\nSo, how long might these social freedoms remain - or could, as some fear, the newly won liberties be short-lived?\nAt Rawda Cafe in central Damascus, just across the road from Parliament, intellectuals gather around long tables to smoke shisha and discuss culture. Under Assad, political activists were picked up and arrested there. Rumour had it that some waiters were regime informants.\nToday, it's a very different picture. The cafe hosts talks and music plays. Prominent figures who once fled the country have returned too - many are greeted by a band playing traditional songs with a giant drum.\nSyrian journalist Mohammad Ghannam is one of them. He tells me that he spent months in prisons during Assad's regime and later moved to France; his euphoria at returning is palpable.\n\"I think everyone who can come back, should come back to rebuild the country,\" he declares. \"There is a window to do whatever you want now compared with before 8 December 2024.\"\nReflecting on the past, he adds: \"Even preachers in the mosques needed to get approval and know what they were going to preach. [Now] it's completely free. [At] Friday prayers the Imam was talking about how your personal freedom shouldn't step on other people's freedom.\"\nOdai al-Zobi has also recently returned to Syria after 14 years - he left to study but says he was unable to come back before now because he was outspoken about the regime.\n\"My books were banned here,\" he tells me. \"Now there is no censorship, you can read whatever you want. I was very surprised that a lot of people want to read and want to know more.\"\n\"This is a big change,\" agrees Ali al-Atassi, a Syrian documentary-maker and son of former Syrian President Noureddine al-Atassi. (His father was deposed in a coup by Hafez al-Assad.)\n\"It changed the rules of the game, and opened a lot of perspectives for the country.\"\nSyria's vibrant arts and culture scene has long been a source of the country's pride: the Assads supported it, wanting to present a rich culture to the world yet some artists and writers were killed for their views on the regime.\nEven carrying certain books was once cause for arrest. Today, however, all kinds of books are on display in shops around the capital - even political titles. Cinema clubs screen films that were previously banned too.\nFor weeks after Assad's fall, the caretaker government didn't appoint a Minister of Culture, but musicians and artists grouped together to protect the culture scene. \nNow, however, there are fresh concerns: while Syria under Assad saw political debates repressed, some worry that repression by clerics could end up forbidding some forms of art seen as anti-religious.\nThere is no clear evidence of this. Dr Maher Al Sharaa, the brother of the interim president, has been seen at the city's Opera House with his family; Vivaldi was played by Syrian musicians. The family looked like any modern one who would go on a weekend cultural outing.\nAnd after the fall of Assad, a cultural event with talks about cinema, music, theatre and performances was held at Beit Farhi, a historic house in the heart of Damascus's Jewish quarter. An all-female orchestra played songs that praised revolutions and martyrs. Some in the audience were left in tears.\n\"It is great to have this opportunity to talk among us about how to protect and support the art scene in Syria,\" says Noura Murad, a choreographer.\nMr al-Atassi also chooses to be optimistic. \"I believe the Syrians won't allow this regime to enter in their private lives, to create rules on how to behave in the public space.\"\nWhen Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa, who led the rebel offensive that overthrew Assad, was appointed by a military council on 29 January, he delivered a speech in which he stressed that the priority was to \"fill the power vacuum in a legitimate and legal way\".\nBut months on, there is concern among some around the likelihood of building a lasting democracy. And there is no system in place to hold officials, including the president, accountable until a permanent constitution is adopted and elections are held.\n\"The past few months, the regime has not been ready to share power and allow other political and social forces to find their place in society,\" argues Mr Al-Atassi. \"Without opening up the political arena to other forces, I don't think Sharaa can bring Syria back to the international community.\"\nIn February, hundreds gathered at the People's Palace in Damascus for a two-day national dialogue about Syria's future. Some critics argued that the meeting was organised in haste and was too short to cover all the key topics.\nAccording to Abdulhay Sayed, a Syrian legal expert and managing partner at Sayed and Sayed law firm, it was neither representative nor truly reflective of consensus.\n\"Large segments of Syrian society felt excluded or unrepresented,\" he argues. \"[It] was conceived as a mechanism to simulate wider assent.\"\nHowever, he concedes: \"It does reflect a certain willingness on the part of the new authorities to expand the scope of consultation.\"\nSharaa, who was leader of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), the former al-Qaeda affiliate and Islamist group that dominated the rebel alliance, has clearly stated his commitment to establishing a country with \"free and impartial elections\".\nHe has also appointed a committee to work on a constitutional declaration, which laid out Syria's future over a five-year transitional period. However, the subsequent declaration didn't enshrine the separation of powers.\n\"He needs to show that he's more serious about political participation from all groups,\" says Mr Al-Atassi.\nThere are some examples of this: a Christian female minister was appointed minister for social affairs, while head of the White Helmet civil defence group, became minister of emergencies and disasters. But some have raised questions about the appointment of Sharaa's brother as head of presidential affairs.\n\"High-ranking former HTS members now occupy key sovereign positions,\" adds Mr Sayed.\nMr Al-Atassi also claims that \"highly qualified people in international law were not asked to participate in the Cabinet. They were overlooked.\"\nThe Minister of Justice holds a degree in Sharia law (Islam's legal system, derived from the Quran), and is not an expert on Syria's Civil Code, which draws heavily on French and Ottoman law. One question being asked is whether codes based on Sharia law could be applied rather than civil ones.\n\"The new authorities have so far made no attempt to replace the existing legal codes with Sharia-inspired legislation,\" says Mr Sayed. However, he adds, \"this remains an area we continue to monitor closely.\n\"The most pressing concern is whether judicial independence will be restored and effectively safeguarded.\"\nUnder Assad's regime, women had relatively equal rights and had been represented in parliament since the 1950s, as well as being present in society at all levels. There are no new written rules that point to that changing, but there are some concerning signs.\nOnly one woman was appointed in the interim government. According to research by University College London and McGill University, women's rights advocates have raised concerns over HTS enforcing an interpretation of Islamic law, which could for example severely restrict women's mobility, dress and public participation.\n\"One important area to watch is whether women judges - who make up approximately 35 to 40 per cent of the judiciary - will face marginalisation or dismissal,\" says Mr Sayed. \"So far, we have seen no signs of such a trend, but continued vigilance is essential.\"\nAs for religious freedoms, there have been no new laws or rulings restricting social life, but some Syrians report that they have seen what appear to be attempts to enforce Islamic rule.\nThe Ministry of Justice has begun separating entry for men and women, plus there have been reports of men distributing flyers on buses and in Umayyad Mosque in Damascus asking women to wear full-faced veils.\nIn Christian neighbourhoods in the capital, cars have been filmed driving through the streets with preachers advocating for Islam over loudspeakers. An order to shut down bars and restaurants in the old city's Christian quarter was only revoked after a public outcry.\nSome observers of Islam tell me they are worried. Damascus is known for its tolerance but there are fears in some quarters that the new authorities have a Salafi background (a strict, orthodox Sunni Muslim sect). \n\"There is an increasing call for a return to religious values,\" says Mr Sayed. \"This presents a profound challenge for those who still believe in democracy, the rule of law, and equal citizenship.\"\nHowever Husam Jazmati, a Syrian academic who researches Islamic movements at the civil society research organisation Impact, claims that Sharaa \"opposes both Islamist and non-Islamist political movements [and] neither wants to establish an Islamic state nor believes it's possible.\n\"They don't want to, and they can't\".\nEven if the government wanted to instil hardline practices, the question is whether they could? Alaa El Din Al Sayyek, an imam based in Damascus, thinks not. He argues that Syrians would reject any attempt to do so.\n\"It is impossible, our society will not accept it,\" he tells me. \"We have lived in harmony with different sects for years even during difficult times. The Quran says it clearly: no compulsion in religion.\"\nToday there are growing tensions: violence in coastal cities has left more than 1,400 people dead, many of them Alawites (part of Assad's minority sect). They were said to be revenge for attacks on Syrian security forces.\nElsewhere, in the north east of the country, even though the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) declared victory over IS in 2019, camps still hold about 56,000 people, many of them the family members of Islamic State group (IS) suspects, more than five years after the jihadists' territorial defeat in Syria.\nThe main question now facing the country, however, is how Syrians see their future. There are some tensions around this, which have seeped into a push-pull between the leadership and HTS, according to Mr Jazmati. \nHe claims that while Sharaa's top circle wants to build \"a conservative, economically liberal\" state, \"they can't stop many of their members - those they've appointed in various positions and rely on because they're trusted - from trying to Islamise public life in Syria.\"\nThe think tank International Crisis Group has similar concerns. It has said that it believes Syria is living \"on borrowed time\".\n\"The interim government is running out of funds, security forces are overstretched, poverty is deepening and insurgency is brewing at the periphery. Outsiders are meddling. Western sanctions deprive leaders of what they need to rebuild, while preventing fragmentation or a return to civil war.\"\nFor Mr Al-Atassi, the solution is straightforward: He believes Sharaa needs to open up the political arena. \"There are no elections today in Syria, there are only nominations,\" he says. \"This is very dangerous.\"\nWith a pause, he adds: \"It could be that a new dictatorship is in the making - but I don't believe that the Syrian people are ready, after five decades, to accept a new dictatorship.\"\nAnd as for the prospect of lasting democracy? \"We need to wait to see,\" he says. \"But I'm not at all optimistic.\"\nHowever there is a wider issue too. That is, could there be a loss of faith in the very idea of democracy given the country's recent history? \nMr Sayed thinks so. \"Though the Assad-era constitutions formally proclaimed political freedoms... our experience of political modernity came in the form of shells falling on our heads, while our bodies were laid bare in detention camps,\" he tells me.\n\"Large segments of the Syrian population have lost faith in the promises of political modernity.\"\nOf the many challenges facing the new leadership, perhaps it is this that they would be wise to address first as they continue to carve out a new path for the future of Syria.\nTop picture credit: Getty Images\nBBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

      "summary": "For the first time in many years, education in Gaza is only accessible to the well-to-do.",
      "content": "For the first time in many years, education in Gaza is only accessible to the well-to-do.\nPalestinians have always been passionate about learning. During the Ottoman era, Palestinian students travelled to Istanbul, Cairo, and Beirut to pursue higher education. During the British Mandate, in the face of colonial policies aimed at keeping the local population ignorant, Palestinian farmers pooled their resources and established schools of their own in rural areas.\nThen came the Nakba, and the occupation and displacement brought new pain that elevated the Palestinian pursuit of education to an entirely different level. Education became a space where Palestinians could feel their presence, a space that enabled them to claim some of their rights and dream of a better future. Education became hope. \n In Gaza, instruction was one of the first social services established in refugee camps. Students would sit on the sand in front of a blackboard to learn. Communities did everything they could to ensure that all children had access to education, regardless of their level of destitution. The first institution of higher education in Gaza - the Islamic University - held its first lectures in tents; its founders did not wait for a building to be erected.\nI remember how, as a child, I would see the alleys of our neighbourhood every morning crowded with children heading to school. All families sent their children to school.\nWhen I reached university age, I saw the same scene: Crowds of students commuting together to their universities and colleges, dreaming of a bright future.\nThis relentless pursuit of education, for decades, suddenly came to a halt in October 2023. The Israeli army did not just bomb schools and universities and burn books. It destroyed one of the most vital pillars of Palestinian education: Educational justice.\nBefore the genocide, the education sector in Gaza was thriving. Despite the occupation and blockade, we had one of the highest literacy rates in the world, reaching 97 percent. The enrolment rate in secondary education was 90 percent, and the enrolment in higher education was 45 percent.\nOne of the main reasons for this success was that education in Gaza was completely free in the primary and secondary stages. Government- and UNRWA-run schools were open to all Palestinian children, ensuring equal opportunities for everyone.\nTextbooks were distributed for free, and families received support to buy bags, notebooks, pens, and school uniforms.\nThere were also many programmes sponsored by the Ministry of Education, UNRWA, and other institutions to support talented students in various fields, regardless of their economic status. Reading competitions, sports events, and technology programmes were organised regularly.\nAt the university level, significant efforts were made to make higher education accessible. There was one government university which charged symbolic fees, seven private universities with moderate to high fees (depending on the college and major), and five university colleges with moderate fees. There was also a vocational college affiliated with UNRWA in Gaza that offered fully free education.\nThe universities provided generous scholarships to outstanding and disadvantaged students.\nThe Ministry of Education also offered internal and external scholarships in cooperation with several countries and international universities. There was a higher education loan fund to help cover tuition fees.\nSimply put, before the genocide in Gaza, education was accessible to all.\nSince October 2023, the Zionist war machine has systematically targeted schools, universities, and educational infrastructure. According to UN statistics, 496 out of 564 schools - nearly 88 percent - have been damaged or destroyed. In addition, all universities and colleges in Gaza have been destroyed. More than 645,000 students have been deprived of classrooms, and 90,000 university students have had their education disrupted.\nAs the genocide continued, the Ministry of Education and universities tried to resume the educational process, with in-person classes for schoolchildren and online courses for university students.\nIn displacement camps, tent schools were established, where young volunteers taught children for free. University professors used online teaching tools like Google Classroom, Zoom, WhatsApp groups, and Telegram channels.\nDespite these efforts, the absence of regular education created a significant gap in the educational process. The incessant bombardment and forced displacement orders issued by the Israeli occupation made attendance challenging. The lack of resources also meant that tent schools could not provide proper instruction.\nAs a result, paid educational centres emerged, offering private lessons and individual attention to students. On average, a centre charges between $25 to $30 per subject per month, and with eight subjects, the monthly cost reaches $240 - an amount most families in Gaza cannot afford.\nIn the higher education sector, cost also became prohibitive. After the first online semester, which was free, universities started requiring students to pay portions of their tuition fees to continue distance learning.\nOnline education also requires a tablet or a computer, stable internet access, and electricity. Most students who lost their devices due to bombing or displacement cannot buy new ones because of the high prices. Access to stable internet and electricity at private \"workspaces\" can cost as much as $5 an hour.\nAll of this has led many students to drop out due to their inability to pay. I, myself, could not complete the last semester of my degree.\nA year and a half of genocide was enough to destroy what took decades to build in Gaza: Educational justice. Previously, social class was not a barrier for students to continue their education, but today, the poor have been left behind.\nVery few families can continue educating all their children. Some families are forced to make difficult decisions: Sending older children to work to help fund the education of the younger ones, or giving the opportunity only to the most outstanding child to continue studying, and depriving the others.\nThen there are the extremely poor, who cannot send any of their children to school. For them, survival is the priority. During the genocide, this group has come to represent a large portion of society.\nThe catastrophic economic situation has forced countless school-aged children to work instead of going to school, especially in families that lost their breadwinners. I see this painful reality every time I step out of my tent and walk around.\nThe streets are full of children selling various goods; many are exploited by war profiteers to sell things like cigarettes for a meagre wage.\nLittle children are forced to beg, chasing passersby and asking them for anything they can give.\nI feel unbearable pain when I see children, who just a year and a half ago were running to their schools, laughing and playing, now stand under the sun or in the cold selling or begging just to earn a few shekels to help their families get an inadequate meal.\nFor Gaza's students, education was never just about getting an academic certificate or an official paper. It was about optimism and courage, it was a form of resistance against the Israeli occupation, and a chance to lift their families out of poverty and improve their circumstances. Education was life and hope.\nToday, that hope has been killed and buried under the rubble by Israeli bombs.\nWe now find ourselves in a dangerous situation, where the gap between the well-to-do and the poor is widening, where an entire generation's ability to learn and think is being diminished, and where Palestinian society is at risk of losing its identity and its capacity to continue its struggle.\nWhat is happening in Gaza is not just a temporary educational crisis, but a deliberate campaign to destroy opportunities for equality and create an unbalanced society deprived of justice.\nWe have reached a point where the architects of the ongoing genocide are confident in the success of their strategy of \"voluntary transfer\" - pushing Palestinians to such depths of despair that they choose to leave their land voluntarily.\nBut the Palestinian people still refuse to let go of their land. They are persevering. Even the children, the most vulnerable, are not giving up. I often think of the words I overheard from a conversation between two child vendors during the last Eid. One said: \"There is no joy in Eid.\" The other one responded: \"This is the best Eid. It's enough that we're in Gaza and we didn't leave it as Netanyahu wanted.\"\nIndeed, we are still in Gaza, we did not leave as Israel wants us to, and we will rebuild just as our ancestors and elders have.\nThe views expressed in this article are the author's own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera's editorial stance. \n Follow Al Jazeera English:",
      "ml_hf_summary": "In Gaza, education has been severely disrupted by the Israeli military's attacks since October 2023.  The attacks have destroyed or damaged over 88% of schools and all universities, leaving nearly 645,000 students without classrooms. The conflict has also made it financially impossible for many families to continue their children's education due to the high costs of private lessons and online learning resources. This has led to a widening gap between the well-to-do and the poor, with many families forced to prioritize survival over education.  The article highlights the devastating impact on Palestinian society, emphasizing that education was not just about academic achievement but also a symbol of resistance against occupation and a means to improve living conditions. Despite this hardship, Palestinians remain determined to rebuild their lives and continue their struggle for justice. \n"

      "content": "A hole-in-the-wall tea shop in West Bengal founded by a freedom fighter is run by regular customers when the owner's out.\nSerampore, India - It is a warm morning in March, and 65-year-old Ashish Bandopadhyay has cycled the 10 minutes from his home to a tea shop in the Chatra neighbourhood of Serampore, about 30km (19 miles) from Kolkata.\nDressed in a pastel pink polo shirt, Ashish takes charge of the shop, declaring it's his \"turn\" to run it today. \"I don't work here,\" he explains with a smile while tearing open a packet of milk as he prepares to brew a fresh pot of cha (the Bengali word for tea). \"I'm just an old-timer and a customer who loves volunteering.\" \n Located in the old part of the town, this hole-in-the-wall shop is locally known as Naresh Shomer cha er dokaan (Naresh Shome's tea shop). In India, the process of preparing and sharing tea forms an important part of social bonds.\nAnd that is what this tea shop is all about. For a century, it has been a space for relaxation, conversation and shared moments. But it takes the social bond one step further: customers not only drink tea but also brew and serve it.\nAshish, who has now retired from his office job with a construction company, has been visiting this tea shop since he was 10 years old. It is where he meets friends to catch up over a cup of tea.\nEach weekday morning, 60-year-old owner Ashok Chakroborty opens the shop and then leaves for his office job.\n\"One of us takes control of running the shop till the time he returns in the evening. Today was my turn,\" Ashish says. In all, there are 10 volunteers who take turns in the shop seven days a week. None are paid - most are volunteer-customers who, like Ashish, have retired and receive a pension from their former employers.\nToday, Ashish arrived at the shop at 9am and closed for lunch at noon. He reopened at 3pm. \"If not every day, I prefer to stay here for the majority of the week. After my departure, another person steps into my role,\" he says.\nThere's no fixed rota - \"whoever is free does it,\" Ashish explains. \"We keep the cash in a wooden box on the shelf after using it to buy milk or sugar. And there hasn't been a single day without a caretaker.\"\nLittle has changed in the 100 years the five-by-seven-foot tea shop has been going - \"except for a few whitewashes and a ceiling repair\", Ashish notes. Despite the layers of paint, the walls are stained dark with soot and smoke from the coal-fired traditional clay stove.\nTea is still served in clay cups as well as paper ones, with a refill costing just five rupees (approximately $0.06).\nThe shop offers a modest tea menu with simple, straightforward options. Customers can choose from milk tea - with or without sugar - and black tea served plain or with lemon, or Kobiraji cha (black tea with spices). Jars of biscuits complete the shop's offerings.\nSituated across from Chatra Kali Babu's Crematorium, family members often come for tea after bidding farewell to loved ones.\nThe shop was founded by Naresh Chandra Shome, who worked for Brooke Bond, a tea company that traces its roots to the colonial era in India. All Ashok, the current owner, knows about Shome from that period is that he left his job to become a freedom fighter.\nFollowing India's independence from British rule in 1947, Shome joined the Communist Party of India (Marxist) and remained an active member until his death in 1995 at the age of 77. Throughout his life, his tea shop served as a gathering place where comrades would meet, sit and exchange ideas over cups of tea.\nToday, the tea shop sits next door to the local CPI(M) office. \"Shome was a helpful man and was active in community service. His shop was well known then and now. There is a photo of him in the party office,\" says Prashanto Mondal, 54, a regular customer at the tea shop.\nHe recalls how he was first brought to the shop by a colleague during a lunch break 25 years ago.\n\"There are many tea stalls in Serampore, but I always come here, almost daily, because of the shop's unique atmosphere and sense of camaraderie,\" the LPG gas delivery agent explains.\nAfter finishing his tea, Prashanto gets up to help Ashish refill the coal in the oven. Like Prashanto, most customers help with duties such as fetching milk from the nearby shop or filling water from the tap.\n\"We have heard stories of Naresh Shome during his activist days,\" says Ashish. \"He would sometimes leave the shop abruptly for urgent community service or be taken by the police, always asking his customers to look after the shop. I believe this legacy has endured - customers naturally take responsibility for the tea shop in the owner's absence - the test of time.\"\nIn about 1925, Shome opened the tea shop on the ground floor of the building owned by his aunt. But before it was a gathering spot for tea drinkers and conversationalists, the 350-year-old building on the banks of the Hooghly River housed various types of shops, including one that sold utensils.\nExposed wooden beams on the ceiling seem to bear the weight of history. The thick limestone walls stand as silent witnesses to the many Bengali, Danish and English people who've passed through over the years. The shop looks out towards Chatra ghat (steps leading down to the river), where Hindus have cremated their dead for generations. Now, a modern electric crematorium has taken the place of traditional wood pyres.\nThe town of Serampore, home to about 200,000 people, predates the West Bengal capital of Kolkata by a few centuries and has been ruled at times by both the Danes and the British. The town was a Danish trading settlement named Frederiksnagore from 1755 to 1845, until the British took over, staying until independence in 1947.\nOnce, horse-driven carriages transported European officers and their families along the streets. Today, the bylanes bustle with motorbikes, electric rickshaws and cars. European-style buildings stand alongside the tall apartment complexes built in more recent decades.\nLocal restoration activist Mohit Ranadip explains that the tea shop holds an important position in the cultural history of Serampore. Ranadip is a member of the Serampore Heritage Restoration Initiative, a local citizen-led body dedicated to preserving and promoting the town's heritage.\n\"Adda and para culture are still very relevant in the [Chatra] locality and maybe that is the reason why the tea shop is still so popular,\" he says.\nIn West Bengal, para culture loosely refers to a neighbourhood or locality, defined by a strong sense of community. Each para inevitably has its adda spot - the corner of a street, park or, indeed, a tea shop. Adda is a beloved pastime that is unique to West Bengal. Markedly different from mere small talk or chatting, it is best described as an informal group conversation that's long, fluid and relaxed in nature. A cup of cha invariably binds these gatherings together.\nIn the Chatra neighbourhood, Naresh Shome's tea shop is a focal point for this adda tradition, attracting people from all walks of life to converge and share their daily experiences over steaming cups of tea.\nPrashanto and his colleagues, Karthick and Amal, discussed the remaining gas cylinders they had to deliver by the end of the day. Some came on their own for a quick tea. The customers who dropped by in the evening were more relaxed, like Anima Kar, who came with her daughter to catch up with her brother.\nThe state of West Bengal's connection with tea also runs deep. About 600km north of Serampore, the tea industry took root in the hills of Darjeeling in the mid-19th century during the British Raj. The first commercial tea gardens were established in Darjeeling and the surrounding areas. The emerald green tea estates of Darjeeling still produce some of the world's most expensive tea.\nAt about 6pm, as evening sets in, Ashok returns from his clerical job. Wearing an olive green T-shirt, he takes over from Ashish, seamlessly continuing the shop's daily rhythm.\nAshok is the son-in-law of Lakhirani Dakhi, the owner of the building. He has been in charge of the shop since Shome's death.\n\"Today Ashish da (brother) gave me 400 rupees ($4.65) as the day's income,\" says Ashok, as he poured tea into clay cups. He says he has never faced any problems with customers not paying; without fail, they always leave the correct amount for tea in the cash box or return later to pay what they owe.\n\"We sell around 200 cups most days,\" he adds. \n\"I love the tea with masala (spice mixture) made by Ashok da,\" says 50-year-old Anima, who has been a customer for years. \"If Kolkata has a coffee house where people meet for some quality time and adda, well, this tea shop is our humble equivalent.\"\nAnima used to come with her father when she was a child and remembers Shome. Now, she sometimes visits with her family. \"The tea shop remains an enduring symbol of tradition, community living and a love for tea. Every morning and evening, people are drawn not just by the tea, but by a profound sense of belonging and shared history,\" Anima says.\nAt 9pm, Ashok pours the last pot of tea for the four remaining customers and prepares to call it a day.\nIn the past couple of years, he has started to worry about the future of his iconic shop.\n\"I doubt whether the younger generation will carry forward this cherished legacy of trust. There are very few visitors from the younger generation who come and participate in the tea shop,\" he says.\nHis son, Ashok says, is an engineer and hasn't shown much interest in the shop.\nRestoration activist Ranadip shares his concerns: \"The younger generation is so busy that they have little time for adda, which seriously puts a question mark on the future of the shop like this.\"\nDespite the shop's uncertain future, Ashok remains hopeful that others will step forward to preserve it, just as previous generations have. \"I choose to stay optimistic that the shop will continue its legacy, as it has for so many years,\" Ashok says. \n Follow Al Jazeera English:",

      "content": "Court says detained pro-Palestine student has shown 'significant evidence' violations to her constitutional rights.\nWashington, DC - A federal judge in the United States has ordered the government to transfer a pro-Palestine Turkish student, Rumeysa Ozturk, to Vermont for the court to assess legal challenges to her detention.\nIn a ruling on Friday, District Court Judge William S Sessions found that Ozturk - who is currently held in Louisiana - has presented \"significant evidence\" to back the allegations that her detention violated her free speech and due process rights.\nOzturk was arrested and had her visa revoked in March. Supporters say she was targeted over an op-ed she co-authored last year, criticising Tufts University for dismissing a student government resolution that called on the school to divest from Israeli companies.\nFor these claims to be assessed, Sessions wrote, Ozturk's case needs to be heard in court.\n\"The Court concludes that this case will continue in this Court with Ms Ozturk physically present for the remainder of the proceedings,\" he wrote.\nThe judge gave the government until May 1 to transfer Ozturk and set a bond hearing on May 9 for her to argue for a temporary release.\nOzturk was sent to a detention facility in Louisiana, in what critics say is part of a government effort to keep detainees away from their supporters and lawyers - and place them in conservative-leaning legal districts. \n The Tufts University student was arrested near her home in Massachusetts on March 30. Surveillance footage of the incident shows masked immigration officers, who did not identify themselves as law enforcement, approaching her on the street and grabbing her hands.\nCritics have described the incident as an abduction.\nHer student visa has been revoked as part of a massive crackdown by President Donald Trump's administration on foreign students who have protested or criticised Israel's war on Gaza.\nSessions confirmed that the only identifiable evidence that the US government is using to detain and deport Ozturk is the op-ed.\n\"Her evidence supports her argument that the government's motivation or purpose for her detention is to punish her for co-authoring an op-ed in a campus newspaper which criticized the Tufts University administration, and to chill the political speech of others,\" Sessions said.\n\"The government has so far offered no evidence to support an alternative, lawful motivation or purpose for Ms Ozturk's detention.\"\nHe also stressed that the First Amendment, which protects free speech, \"has long extended\" to non-citizens living in the US.\nThe case Sessions is overseeing is known as a habeas corpus petition. It challenges Ozturk's detention, not the broader push to deport her.\nDeportation matters are reviewed through a separate system, where non-citizens bring their cases in front of an immigration judge who works within the executive branch. It is not a separate part of the government, as the independent judiciary is. \n Advocates say immigration judges often \"rubber-stamp\" the decisions of the executive branch under which they work. An immigration judge in Louisiana denied Ozturk's release on bail earlier this week.\nImmigration cases can be appealed to a board of immigration appeals, an administrative body. As a last resort, immigrants can petition to bring their case in front of a court of appeals that is part of the regular judicial system.\nThe Trump administration has been stressing that the law gives it leeway over immigration issues - and that, in turn, offers the presidency broad powers that supersede concerns about free speech and due process.\nTo authorise the deportations, Secretary of State Marco Rubio has invoked a rarely used provision of the Immigration and Nationality Act that grants him the authority to remove non-citizens whom he deems to \"have serious adverse foreign policy consequences\" for the US.\nBut part of Friday's ruling could have sweeping implications for Ozturk and other students facing deportation.\nSessions dismissed the notion that detained immigrants can have their constitutional rights ignored because of an administrative process.\nThe judge said the government is arguing that an immigration law \"grants practically limitless, unreviewable power to detain individuals for weeks or months, even if the detention is patently unconstitutional\". \n Follow Al Jazeera English:",

      "summary": "A surge in marathons and lucrative prize money has attracted runners from East Africa to Vietnam.",
      "content": "A surge in marathons and lucrative prize money has attracted runners from East Africa to Vietnam, but becoming a champion is not without challenges.\nHo Chi Minh City, Vietnam - Ethiopian runner Tesfaye Tsegaye Keress deftly made his way through nearly 18,000 participants to position himself near the starting line of the Techcombank Ho Chi Minh City International Marathon in December.\nKeress said his diminutive size - he stands just 1.62 metres (5.3ft) tall and weighs about 50kg (116 pounds) - allowed the 27-year-old to slink easily through the throngs of runners to secure a strategic spot near the front just before the starting pistol was fired, in what was billed as Vietnam's biggest marathon.\nJust days earlier, Keress had landed in Ho Chi Minh City - Vietnam's commercial capital. He was accompanied by fellow Ethiopian runner, Dereje Alemu Miko, who came to compete in the 21km (13-mile) half-marathon at the event where Keress would run the full 42.1km marathon.\nIn a competition consisting primarily of thousands of local Vietnamese runners, the participation of Keress and Miko immediately stirred interest. Local media wanted to know who the competitors from East Africa were.\nAs Keress told Al Jazeera, love for the sport of running was not the only reason for their trip to Vietnam.\nKeress knew that taking first place in the Ho Chi Minh City marathon would earn him a $2,500 cash prize.\nWinning was important, he said.\n\"I have a wife and two sons, and we live in Sendafa,\" Keress said, naming his hometown in Ethiopia's Oromia region, about 38km (24 miles) northeast of the capital, Addis Ababa.\n\"We run a chicken farm and have two cows for milk. We plan to expand our farm using the money from marathon races,\" he said.\nTo win, he would not only have to beat some of Vietnam's best long-distance runners but also Kenya's Edwin Kiptoo - a fellow East African who currently dominates Vietnam's marathon running circuit after winning a string of major races.\nKeress might be considered an average runner in his native Ethiopia - a country that has produced some of the world's most renowned track athletes.\nHis personal best speed to complete a marathon is 2:23:50, which he achieved in 2023 in a marathon in Thailand. Though impressive, that speed would still rule him out of top-tier marathon competitions - the Boston Marathon requires speeds of less than 2 hours 13 minutes for entrants in its professional division.\nIn Vietnam, however, Keress's speed makes him a championship contender in a country where running has seen a steep rise in popularity.\nOver the past decade, marathons have boomed in Vietnam - a development partly attributed to the country's increasingly wealthy middle class seeking ways to keep fit in the country's burgeoning big cities. There is also a new social side to running in Vietnam's well-attended marathons, according to reports, which have seen a steep rise in popularity since the mid-2010s.\nDespite a years-long slump during COVID, the popularity of running came back even stronger post-pandemic, with many people focused on keeping healthy. Local news site VnExpress reported in 2023 that a total of 41 full marathon races, with some 264,000 entrants, took place in 27 provinces and cities across Vietnam that year. That was 10 more marathons than were held in Vietnam in 2022.\nWith hundreds of thousands of runners taking part in a plethora of marathons up and down this country of 100 million people, major private sponsors have stepped in with prize money.\nVietnam's many marathons and lucrative prizes of thousands of dollars for winners are now attracting high-performing athletes - like Keress and Kiptoo - from the elite running centres of East Africa. \n East African athletes have long been a dominant force in competitive running, with world-famous track stars like Kenya's Eliud Kipchoge - who in 2019 became the first person in recorded history to run a 42-km marathon in less than two hours - and Ethiopian Haile Gebrselassie who is considered one of the greatest long-distance runners in history, having set 27 world records.\nSporting scouts have for years flocked to Kenya and Ethiopia, among other East African countries, to identify promising talent. Deals to compete in competitions around the world are often mediated by sport agents, who sponsor a runner and in return may take a cut of their winnings if successful. There is also the opportunity to capitalise on media attention with product and brand deals that race victories accrue for individuals and running teams.\nSuch an arrangement brought Keress and Miko to compete in the Ho Chi Minh City marathon and half-marathon in December. They are both managed by a promoter from Thailand who sponsors a team of runners and also operates a company specialising in energy supplements for athletes.\nMarathon running has also taken off in Thailand, along with a growing market for running gear and other services. And when runners such as Keress and Miko win races, there is a high return for sponsoring brand names and their products and services.\nWhen Edwin Kiptoo - who should not be confused with another younger Kenyan runner with the same name but of much greater international acclaim - first arrived in Vietnam in December 2023, he described how he was initially unprepared for the country and its costs.\nSimply finding accommodation on arrival was challenging for Kiptoo, who arrived with a budget of just 150,000 Vietnamese dong (less than $6), hoping to find a simple place to rest one night before the race. In downtown Ho Chi Minh City, the cheapest room Kiptoo could find was double that price.\nBut good fortune seemed to favour Kiptoo when he was befriended by local runner Le Hoan whom he met at the race station where they went to collect their running bibs the day before the race. Learning of Kiptoo's struggle to find somewhere cheap to stay, Le Hoan tried to help in the search for accommodation using a booking app. Still no luck.\nAs Kiptoo had handed Le Hoan his passport during the search for somewhere to stay, the Vietnamese runner spotted that they were both born in the same year, and that the Kenyan's birthday was on the same day as his wife's. Taking the alignment of dates as an auspicious sign, Le Hoan invited the Kenyan to his home. Over dinner with Le Hoan's family, Kiptoo told them how he was running to support his family and had to save as much as possible.\nLe Hoan paid for the runner's stay in a hostel that night - on the eve of the huge Techcombank Ho Chi Minh City. The next day, Kiptoo would run faster than Vietnam's two best marathon runners, Hoang Nguyen Thanh and Nguyen Van Lai, to win the race and pocket a $2,500 cash prize on the spot.\n\"Mr Hoan took me home and offered me meals with his family. He also rented me a hostel room for the night,\" Kiptoo recounted to Al Jazeera. \"After I won my first race, I offered to pay Hoan back but he simply refused,\" he said.\n\"The generosity of him and his family truly surprised me,\" he added.\nKiptoo's wins and public profile in Vietnam have rocketed since. He quickly became a star runner in Vietnam and his participation in races is now sought after. His winnings have also stacked up, earning an average of about $1,000 each week for taking first place in races across the country.\nBut that was just the beginning.\nIn October 2024, Kiptoo signed a major sponsorship contract with sportswear company Do-Win Vietnam.\nThe company announced in a celebratory Facebook post how it had entered \"a formal partnership with renowned runner Kiptoo!\"\n\"This collaboration will create new breakthroughs and further strengthen the brand's position in the sports industry,\" it said.\nThe deal covers the runner's living expenses, competition entrance fees, and, crucially, secures a visa allowing Kiptoo to compete professionally in Vietnam. In the past, visas and visa extensions for Africans in Vietnam have been problematic, partly due to a crackdown on foreigners involved in crime in the country.\nSo having a major sponsor behind him gives runners such as Kiptoo a large degree of security.\nThe 38-year-old, whose wife and daughter are still in Kenya, has even been given access to exclusive, publicly funded sports facilities and resources, which are typically reserved for provincial or national-level Vietnamese athletes.\nNow freed from financial pressure and logistical concerns regarding race participation, Kiptoo said he has been able to fully dedicate himself to training, making him a force nearly impossible to beat in Vietnam's marathons.\n\"The support from Vietnamese people makes me feel at home,\" Kiptoo told Al Jazeera.\nSuccess in Vietnam has not only brought Kiptoo financial rewards but also elevated him to a sort of sports celebrity status among local people. He has been featured many times by local Vietnamese media because of his running success and his posts on Facebook receive thousands of reactions - mostly from his Vietnamese fans. \n A marathon, which usually lasts at least two hours for top-level runners, inherently carries risks as it challenges a person's physical and mental limits.\nFor African runners competing in Vietnam, challenges exist not only during the race but also in the many twists and turns their professional journey takes.\nIn March 2023, runners Kemboi Ezekiel from Kenya and Marta Tinsae Birehan from Ethiopia were full of hope on entering a race in Ho Chi Minh City after hearing that breaking the Vietnamese marathon record would win them a car. After arriving in the country, they discovered that the car prize had been a one-time offer available only in the previous year's race.\nDespite their disappointment, both runners went on to compete. While Ezekiel faced little competition in the men's race, Marta unexpectedly collapsed while leading the women's race. She had mistakenly consumed an electrolyte drink at a water station, which upset her digestive system.\nEven Kiptoo, with more experience and many marathon championships under his belt in Vietnam, cannot escape challenges. In late 2024, he was sponsored to compete in a marathon in Hanoi. Due to a misunderstanding, a sponsor failed to register Kiptoo among the professional athletes competing. As a result, despite winning the marathon, Kiptoo only received an age-group prize of $200, rather than the $2,100 winner's takings. He said he did not want to complain about the outcome, saying \"we all have to follow the rules.\"\nRunning in the Ho Chi Minh City Marathon in December along an already familiar course and accustomed to the climate, Kiptoo cruised to victory over Keress and thousands of others to further cement his reign over the Vietnamese marathon scene.\nFinishing just behind Kiptoo, Keress limped across the finish line, grimacing in pain. He attributed his performance to fatigue from another recent marathon.\nAfter receiving treatment in the recovery area, Keress's pain subsided but his frustration lingered until his mood was lifted when he discovered that he had won $1,000 in prize money for taking third place - a welcome contribution to his dream of expanding his farm back home. However, as his promoter will also take a cut of his winnings, his actual takings would not be so big.\nHis teammate Miko dominated the half marathon, securing a $600 prize.\nAfter their races, both runners were taken back to their hotel to rest before returning to Thailand, where they had been based for the previous six months in a training camp outside the capital, Bangkok. Their Thai promoter oversees all aspects of their running careers in Southeast Asia - from travel and accommodation to training plans, race entries and immigration visas.\nFor runners such as Keress and Miko, who have travelled little beyond their home countries, such management deals are indispensable. They told Al Jazeera how they hold their Thai manager in high regard, viewing him as a sort of father figure.\nBut the relationship seems closer to employee and employer, with the runners being very much bound by the overriding imperative of achieving good performance for their team and sponsor - in an unspoken power dynamic.\nKeress and Miko recounted how they had plans to return to Ethiopia and reunite with their families.\nThey did not know how much prize money they would be bringing home with them as the cost of their travel expenses to competitions, accommodation and food are deducted from their winnings.\nAnd not all marathons pay winners immediately - some prizes are delayed for months and financial security is far from assured for many runners.\nDespite the difficulty and uncertainty faced by prize-hunting runners in Vietnam, rumours about the country as a life-changing destination for athletes are spreading in East Africa, according to Kiptoo, Keress and others.\nPreviously a teacher in Eldoret, in Kenya's Rift Valley region, Kiptoo's meagre salary barely supported his family. Then COVID-19 hit and his family's finances were devastated. That was, he said, when he took up running seriously as a way out of poverty.\nHis success in Vietnam has not only allowed him to support his family but also to buy several properties as investments in Kenya.\nKiptoo recounted how he never expected that Vietnam would become so central to his life as an athlete and breadwinner for his family.\n\"In Kenya, we watch a lot of Vietnamese films, but very few people actually know what the country is really like,\" Kiptoo said.\nHe did not know either, at the beginning.\nNow with marathon running projected to continue growing in coming years, the draw of Vietnam for African runners is not likely to wane soon.\n\"Perhaps more Kenyan athletes will come here in the future to earn money through running events. But it's not easy,\" he said.\n\"The two countries are very far apart, and marathons always carry unpredictable risks.\" \n Follow Al Jazeera English:",

He has denied such accusations, professing he would not become a dictator but rather is trying to rescue the North African country from political chaos and rampant corruption.\nThe report said Tunis had turned arbitrary detention into a cornerstone of repressive policy.\n\"Saied's government has returned the country to an era of political prisoners, robbing Tunisians of hard-won civil liberties,\" said Bassam Khawaja, deputy Middle East and North Africa director at HRW.\nSince 2023, authorities have arrested dozens of prominent political opposition figures as well as journalists, activists and lawyers in a crackdown critics say has undermined the democracy gained in the 2011 Arab Spring popular uprising. \n Follow Al Jazeera English:",

The committee claims these trials are part of a broader repressive campaign by President Kais Saied's regime, which has targeted opposition voices across various sectors. Human Rights Watch (HRW) also condemned the crackdown on dissent in Tunisia, highlighting arbitrary detention as a tool to silence critics and suppress political opposition.  Saied denies accusations of authoritarianism, claiming his actions are aimed at restoring stability and combating corruption. \n"

I imagine that that's why we have campaigns, and we'll find out. But look, I support the death penalty.\"\nYost explained that \"safeguards\" must be used, and he emphasized that there are \"no do-overs\" but said that \"we need\" the death penalty.\n\"What do you do with a guy who's serving life without parole and then he kills a prison guard or a cook inside?\" Yost said. \"A family loses a loved one because of this murder. Was that a freebie? What, are we gonna give them another life sentence? So, at least in that circumstance, we need to have the death penalty, and then we're just arguing about when we use it.\"\n\"But the death penalty is not working in Ohio right now. We haven't abolished it. We still have the promise of it out there as the ultimate justice. We haven't executed anyone since 2018.

The Bengals come forward, and they want $350 million, and FC Cincinnati is saying, 'Well, what about us?' And pretty soon, we're spending billions of dollars on sports stadiums that are used in one town a few days a year, when we could be spending that money on any number of other things, whether we're talking about roads, bridges, economic development, whether we're talking schools, or we're talking about tax cuts. None of this makes sense to me. We at least need a plan and a limit. Right now, it looks like the candy store is just open.\"\nFox News Digital asked Yost what he hears most often when he travels the state talking to voters, and he said that the economy and \"kitchen table\" issues are most prevalent, but pointed out that Trump's tariff policies, which have been much maligned by the Democrats, are more popular than the media lets on. \n\"Right now, everybody's watching as the world economy is being reordered, and unlike what I'm hearing from the disaster predicted by the elite press on the coasts, it's a much different situation on the ground in Ohio,\" Yost said. \"I talk to a lot of businesses that think that this is going to be good for them, that the fair and reciprocal kinds of trade are going to bring a new resurgence to Ohio and to their industries, even though they see some pain and that's what everybody's talking about right now.\"\nUltimately, Yost told Fox News Digital that he believes that his \"record of results\" shows that he is the candidate with the \"experience and the vision and the know-how\" to \"bring Ohio to the bright future that's out there for us.\"\nAndrew Mark Miller is a reporter at Fox News.

Bush at a special event in Nashville. That performance opened another door. A year later, she was invited to sing at the 2004 Republican National Convention at Madison Square Garden in New York.\nAfter her performance in New York, we were ushered into the president's box - seated just behind George H. W. and Barbara Bush. The following day, the White House called again while we were packing to head home.\nThey wanted us on the platform with the president as he accepted his nomination.\nWe stood behind a president once on a stage the whole world saw. But on Easter, we celebrate the One who holds the whole world. (iStock)\nThat Thursday night, the arena roared. Flags hung sharp and bright overhead. The crowd's cheers rattled the seats. The place pulsed like a living thing. If you watch the footage, you'll see Gracie and me just over the president's left shoulder, clapping until our hands gave out.\nWHY EASTER MATTERS\nAs surreal as it all felt, one moment stood out - and it didn't happen on the stage or near the president. It came a week after the Nashville event. I was back at the same hotel and walked past the ballroom - the same room that had held the president, Secret Service, media, and the temporary seat of American power.\nNow?\nEmpty. No podium. No flags. Not even a chair left behind. Just another room, waiting for the next event.\nThat's the thing about power in this world. It shows up big - but it doesn't stay.\nPresident George W.

Mutual Fund and ETF data provided by Refinitiv Lipper.\n \n 'The Saints' releases new episodes, exclusively streaming on Fox Nation, starting April 4.\nEaster celebrates the Resurrection of Jesus from the dead. It is the cornerstone of Christianity. The faith stands or falls on this foundation.\nTheologians say there are three questions about Easter that Christians should be prepared to answer: Was Jesus God? Was He crucified? Did He Rise from the dead? Every other detail about Jesus's life, ministry, arrest, trial and death sentence, are secondary in comparison to those three questions.\nTheologian and author Dr. Lee Strobel said he once talked to Hugh Hefner, the owner of Playboy magazine and an agnostic, about Jesus. He asked him, \"What if the resurrection were true, that Jesus actually rose from the dead? Hefner said, \"Well, yeah, that would change everything?\" Then Strobel asked, \"Have you ever investigated the Resurrection?\" Hefner answered, \"No.\"\nGEN Z MEN POUR INTO CHURCH PEWS MORE OFTEN THAN WOMEN, FLIPPING THE TREND ON FAITH: 'WHAT'S THE LORD DOING?' \nThat parallels the culture at large's beliefs about organized religion. Researcher George Barna said the greatest spiritual threat today is \"syncretism.\" In other words, designer religion, where people create a fusion of different religions, without bowing down to anyone of them. While a study at Cornell University found that young people today are creating their own personal faith; a 'spiritual not religious' form of self-worship.\nIt's the kind of spiritual individualism that doesn't ask questions about the core tenets of any faith.\nWas Jesus God? Was He crucified? Did He Rise from the dead? (iStock)\nBut are those three questions about Easter answerable? Yes, says Strobel.\n\"As an atheist trained in law and journalism... I spent two years of my life investigating this stuff,\" says Strobel... \"and coming to the conclusion that in light of the avalanche of historical data for the Resurrection of Jesus, it would have taken more faith for me to maintain my atheism than to become a Christian.\"\nStrobel has written a series of books based on investigating the claims of Christianity. The best-seller, \"The Case For Christ,\" was the first of many. His latest book, \"Seeing the Supernatural,\" explores the plethora of the mysteries of the unseen spiritual realm, like angels and demons, mystical dreams, near-death experiences... and of course, the Resurrection.\nGEN Z LEADS RISE IN CHURCH ATTENDANCE IN UK: POLL\nOn an episode of my \"Lighthouse Faith\" podcast, Strobel says the Resurrection as a supernatural and divine event, hinges on Jesus being the Son of God, equal to God, the Word of God made flesh, and God incarnate. Why? Because Jesus said. \"The Son of Man is going to be delivered into the hands of men. They will kill him, and after three days he will rise.\"\nSo...\nIn the New Testament Gospel accounts of Jesus' life, it's pretty clear Jesus claimed to be God. Theologian and author Rick Renner, in his book, \"Easter: The Rest of the Story,\" highlights some key events of Holy Week that help answer that question. On Thursday after the Last Supper, Jesus and the Apostles go to the Garden of Gethsemane. There, hundreds of Roman soldiers descend on the Garden to arrest Jesus. The Gospel of John recounts that Jesus said to them, \"Whom do you seek? 'They answered , \"Jesus of Nazareth. \"In most English translations, Jesus responds, \"I am he.\"\nEaster cross (iStockphoto)\nBut Renner says, \"The (actual) Greek says, 'ego eimi,' which is, I AM. It's the same words that God identified himself with to Moses in Exodus chapter three.\"\nOn a recent episode of my \"Lighthouse Faith\" podcast, Renner talked about some of the unknown facts about that scene in the Garden, like how many Roman soldiers did it take to arrest one man? And who was that mysterious youth wrapped in only a towel that ran away naked after being chased?\nMARTIN SCORSESE TELLS THE STORY OF ST. MOSES THE BLACK, A ONCE-BLOODTHIRSTY BANDIT WHO BECAME AN ICON OF MERCY\nRenner says there are other places in the Bible where it's clear that Jesus acts and says things with the kind of authority that only someone believing he was God would say and do. Jesus tells His followers, \"Very truly I tell you... before Abraham was born, I am! \"Again, the words God uses to identify Himself in the Old Testament and his claims to have been in existence long before the patriarch Abraham was born. And this famous verse, \"I am the way, and the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.\"\nJesus's declaration of divinity is what sealed His fate. It angered the prevailing religious leaders, who then pressured the civil authorities to do away with him. They had him arrested. He was beaten and then crucified on a cross.\nStrobel says despite Dan Brown's widely popular fiction \"The Da Vinci Code,\" and other conspiracy theorists who postulate that Jesus didn't die on the cross and somehow he survived... the evidence proves otherwise.\nSays Strobel, \"We have not only accounts in the New Testament, we've also got five ancient sources outside the Bible that talk about His execution. In fact, no less of a source than the Journal of the American Medical Association, which is a secular, scientific, peer-reviewed medical journal, carried an investigation into the death of Jesus and said, quote, 'clearly the weight of the historical and medical evidence indicates that Jesus was dead even before the wound to his side was inflicted'. So, Jesus clearly was dead.\"\nStrobel says one of the key issues about the Resurrection is that the accounts are quite early in the historical timeline. Skeptics say that the resurrection was a legend concocted by Jesus' followers. But legends take about100 to 200 years to develop.\nAuthor Lee Strobel says one of the key issues about the Resurrection is that the accounts are quite early in the historical timeline. (iStock)\nSays Strobel, \"We have a report of the Resurrection of Jesus Christ, including named eyewitnesses and groups of eyewitnesses including 500 at once who saw him alive, that has been dated back by scholars to within months of the death of Jesus. That is a news flash in ancient history.\"\nIn comparison, the first two biographies of Alexander the Great were written 400 years after his life... and they are generally considered reliable, says Strobel. \"So here we've got something that goes right back virtually to the scene.\"\nAnd that pesky empty tomb is a head scratcher. Did his disciples steal the body and perpetuate a lie about his raising from the dead? The fact, says Strobel, that everyone admits the tomb was empty, corroborates eyewitness accounts.\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\nSays Strobel, \"We have no fewer than nine ancient sources inside and outside the New Testament confirming and corroborating the conviction of the disciples that they encountered the risen Jesus. That is an avalanche of historical data.\"\nSo what? What difference does it make if the Resurrection is true?\nFormer cold case murder detective J. Warner Wallace says it makes all the difference in the world. Wallace, a former atheist, used his forensic skills to try to debunk Christianity and came away a staunch believer. He saw in the four Gospel accounts of the Resurrection not a series of discrepancies, but four different eyewitness accounts of the same event. If the four writers had said the exact same thing, just like in any murder investigation, Wallace says he would have known there was a cover-up.\nSays Warner, \"The evidence broke through my philosophical naturalism, and the Gospels passed all the tests we use to evaluate eyewitness accounts.\"\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nBut there is one more mountain to climb. To believe Jesus is God, that he died on a cross and was supernaturally resurrected... can all be intellectual facts. But to bow down and worship Jesus as your Lord and Savior because on that cross he defeated death and bridged the eternal chasm between God and humanity... that takes a lot more.... that takes leap of faith.\nHAPPY EASTER!\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FROM LAUREN GREEN \nLauren Green currently serves as Fox News Channel's (FNC) chief religion correspondent based in the New York bureau.

And if there's one place on Earth where showmanship reigns supreme, it's Las Vegas.\nBut Donald Trump didn't build a hotel in Vegas to learn how to count cards or win at slots. He's built many hotels. What he picked up in Las Vegas was the magician's most powerful tool: misdirection.

Tariff Hype, But The Real Tariffs Were Aimed At China\nEveryone's shouting about Trump's 10% tariff on all countries - calling it reckless, inflationary and a new trade war in disguise. But while the mainstream media fixates on the headlines, Trump's real play is something else entirely: Sending a warning message to China and reviving good old American manufacturing.\nConsider Trump's tactics. Announce a policy. Change a policy. Announce a policy. Change a policy.\nPart of being a master negotiator is to never let your opponent get balanced footing. In the end of this massive flurry of tariff talks the last two weeks, the real tariff hit China the hardest at 145%, sending the ultimate message that we won't tolerate manipulative tactics from China.\nHERE'S WHAT TRUMP IS REALLY UP TO WITH HIGH-STAKES TARIFF GAMBIT\nWhile behind closed doors, the Trump team is simultaneously working with economic advisors to roll out a broader industrial plan - one focused on bringing critical supply chains home, incentivizing American-made goods and loosening our dangerous reliance on China. The tariff talk? That's just the spark. The fire is economic independence.\n2. Tariff Revenue, Tax Talks\nAmid all the tariff scuttlebutt, most Americans are forgetting that right around the corner looms one of the largest tax discussions in American history. President Trump signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in 2017, and those very tax cuts are set to expire at the end of 2025. \nOne of the big initial questions is, how we are going to pay for the tax cuts to continue and for what was promised on the campaign, including no tax on tips, no tax on overtime, and no tax on Social Security benefits.\nAccording to a study, President Trump's tariff plan (as of April 8, 2025) is projected to raise significant revenue - over $5.2 trillion over 10 years on a \"strict conventional\" basis and $4.2 trillion on a \"partially dynamic\" basis commonly used with tariffs. This revenue could be used to reduce federal debt, thereby encouraging private investment.\nHOW THE SENATE AND HOUSE FIND $2 TRILLION\nInstead, while most of the public-facing discussion in the media has been about trade imbalances or resurrecting fairness of trade around the world so the United States doesn't get taken advantage of anymore, this is a master magician move by President Trump as I predict he will use these tariffs revenues as a bargaining chip for a new tax plan that will move corporate tax rates to 15%, fulfill part of the \"no tax\" promises made on the campaign trail, and create tax cuts for millions of middle-class families in America. It's just that nobody is talking about it right now.\n3. It's Not A Nobel Prize, It's The Noble Cause\nFrom Ukraine to Gaza, and with growing tensions between Taiwan and China, global instability is on the rise. Some suggest that Trump's goal in stopping these wars is selfishly to win a Nobel Peace Prize.\nBut while President Joe Biden tried to walk a tightrope, hoping to please both progressives and defense hawks, Trump is pushing a simple message: peace through energy, economic strength, and keeping our enemies off balance. If you don't comply, \"there will be hell to pay.\"\nWe don't always know what President Trump's real goal is in this magic trick. Take over Greenland? Canada as the 51st state? Gulf of America? Mineral deals with Ukraine?\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\nIf you don't watch the sleight of hand, what he's calling for is a return to full-scale American energy dominance - through oil, gas, nuclear and even clean coal - to take power back from rogue nations like Iran and Russia. \nWhile critics scream \"isolationism,\" Trump may just be pulling off the ultimate trick by crafting a platform of controlled strength that aims to keep America out of wars by making sure no one wants to pick a fight in the first place. How would that be for a grand finale?\nAtlantic City and Las Vegas may have taught Donald Trump that if you want to win the game, you don't just play your hand - you control where everyone's looking. And while the media, the left and even some conservatives keep falling for the noise, he's laying track for a political comeback that's part Houdini, part heavyweight prizefighter.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nLove him or hate him, Trump knows how to put on a show. But don't mistake the sizzle for the steak. Look past the lights - and you'll see the real trick: getting stuff done for America while everyone else is watching the shiny objects.\nBecause in politics, just like in Vegas, the brilliant magicians don't succeed with luck.

      "ml_hf_summary": "Former President Donald Trump is using a strategy of \"misdirection\" in his current political endeavors, drawing attention to tariffs while simultaneously working on broader economic plans.  He has implemented 10% tariffs on goods from multiple countries, aiming to send a message to China and revive American manufacturing. These tariffs are expected to generate significant revenue that could be used to reduce the federal debt and incentivize private investment. Trump is also using these tariffs as leverage in negotiations for tax reform, potentially including lower corporate tax rates and expanded tax breaks for middle-class families.  Trump's approach involves a focus on energy independence and global stability, aiming to deter conflict through economic strength and controlled power dynamics. His actions are being analyzed by political analysts who see his tactics as part of a larger strategy to achieve political goals while maintaining public attention. \n"

There's so much wisdom in their answers to my questions; it opened my eyes to the hard-earned success of the people around me every day. The chapters span the questions of how to decide what you want to do in your career, tried and true ways to get the promotions you want, managing the elusive work-life balance, and focusing on what really matters in your life before you retire, or IF you retire, as my friend Stuart Varney talks about in that chapter.\nWhereas my last book was targeted at young women, this book has a much larger audience and isn't specifically targeted at women. I included advice from a wide variety of people so that I could get as many perspectives as possible into the book. I think I'll be a better mentor now that I have put into a one-stop shop so much rich new advice. \nHere's who I think would benefit from reading \"I Wish Someone Had Told Me\":\n* Ambitious young people trying to figure out what they want to do and what industry they want to go into\n* Young career enthusiasts going for their first promotion and trying to climb to the next rung on the ladder\n* Solidifying your position in the workforce and achieving that next level of success in management, as an entrepreneur, or on the executive track\n* New parents who are trying to figure out how to handle the responsibilities of work and family\n* Anyone feeling burned out and wondering about switching careers\n* Managers looking for fresh ways to give guidance to their employees -- to help train, encourage, and recruit talent. \n* Those searching for a bigger meaning in their life beyond their career \nI learned so much, such as how to better handle disappointment and rejection; how to stay curious and be a person that continues to grow; and how to laugh at circumstances instead of getting bogged down by them.\nSHORT QUESTIONS WITH DANA PERINO FOR TOM SHILLUE\nIn particular, for example, I loved how Martha MacCallum said that when she was working in television and raising her three young children that she didn't let herself think more than three months ahead. That's excellent, practical advice that works for anyone -- even those without children (but with a Percy!).\nI think I'll be a better mentor now that I have put into a one-stop shop so much rich new advice that I can use to inform my thinking. \nFox News' Dana Perino of \"America's Newsroom.\" \nThat choosing to be loved is not a career-limiting decision. Back in 1997, when I met Peter on an airplane (it happens, I swear!), I was quite worried about what would happen to my career track if I moved to England to marry him -- a guy 18 years my senior who'd been divorced twice before, and someone I'd known for only a few months. I was way too preoccupied with what others would think of me, how they'd judge me, if I chose to go for it. \nA family friend pulled me aside that Christmas and asked me what was going on with Peter and me. I explained my hesitation. And she said, \"Don't give up on this chance to be loved. It may be your only shot.\" And boy was she right. \n\"Choosing to be loved helped make my career possible.\"\nMaking that decision turned out to be the very best one of my life. Twenty-eight years later we are still together, and we pinch ourselves every day that we came so close to not meeting that day. I almost missed that flight, and Peter nearly took an earlier one. That we were assigned seats next to each other was a gift from God that we can never repay. \nThe best we can do is pass on this advice to everyone -- choosing to be loved helped make my career possible. Without him, I wouldn't have accomplished what I have so far -- and nothing I'd have done would have mattered at all if I didn't have him to share it with me.\nFox News' Dana Perino has written a new book of advice. \nI wish someone had told me that I didn't have to worry my 20s away -- that, as an educated American woman, I had already won life's great lottery. \nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nWorry was a waste of time and my greatest hope is that readers will take away some practical tips that they can apply to their lives to ensure that they're getting the most out of their time on earth.

Mutual Fund and ETF data provided by Refinitiv Lipper.\n \n Andrea White, a city archaeologist in St. Augustine, Florida, spoke to Fox News Digital about the recent excavation of 18th-century British redoubts in the Sunshine State.\nArchaeologists in the oldest city in the United States recently excavated part of an historic district -- unearthing remnants of its short-lived British past.\nFox News Digital spoke with Andrea White, a city archaeologist in St. Augustine, Florida, about the excavation. The project took place in the city's Lincolnville neighborhood and wrapped up in February. (See the video at the top of this article.) \nArchaeologists were digging at the site as they made way for construction and discovered the dried-up moat of a British redoubt, or small outpost.\nTRAVELERS HEAD TO 'MOST WELCOMING CITIES' IN AMERICA: SEE IF YOURS MADE THE LIST\n\"We knew there were a series of British redoubts,\" White said. \n\"In St. Augustine, everyone thinks about the Spanish period, but we actually had a 20-year period where the British were in control of both East and West Florida.\"\nThe British inhabitants of St. Augustine built the redoubt in 1781, due to fears of attacks by the Spanish. (City of St. Augustine Archaeology Program via AP)\nSt. Augustine was primarily a Spanish military town in the first 200 years of its history, beginning in 1565. \nFlorida came under British control when Spain traded it for Havana, Cuba, which had been captured by the British.\nIn 1763, through the Treaty of Paris, the British gained control of Florida and the Seven Years' War (1756-1763) ended. But the British inhabitants of St. Augustine still worried about attacks by the Spanish -- hence the fortifications, according to numerous historical accounts.\nARCHAEOLOGISTS DISCOVER LONG-LOST TOMB OF UNKNOWN PHARAOH IN EGYPT\nAt the end of the American Revolution, the Spanish crown was given back control of Florida in exchange for some of their assistance to the British. The Sunshine State didn't become U.S. territory until 1821.\n\"The Spanish actually attacked both [the port of] Mobile and Pensacola,\" White said. \"So there was a great fear that there could be an attack on St. Augustine.\"\nThe redoubt contained a dry moat with organic material, including seeds, that will undergo additional testing. (City of St. Augustine Archaeology Program via AP)\n\"A series of these small redoubts were constructed sort of surrounding the historic town with plans to actually connect them by a series of walls and defensive moats,\" White added. \n\"But that kind of never came to fruition because the American Revolution ended, and so did the threat to the British at the time.\"\nANCIENT SETTLEMENT REVEALS REMAINS OF 1,800-YEAR-OLD DOG, BAFFLING EXPERTS: 'PRESERVED QUITE WELL'\nOne of the most surprising parts of the excavation, first reported by The Associated Press, was not what the archaeologists found, but what they didn't find.\n\"We know there's at least six additional [redoubts] out there.\"\nWhite told Fox News Digital the artifacts they uncovered were few and far between.\n\"In [an] urban context, we're used to finding tons of artifacts because people have lived here for over 4,000 years, but in this case, it was really the lack of artifacts that surprised us,\" the historian said.\nANCIENT TOMB TIED TO ROMAN GLADIATOR DISCOVERED BY ARCHAEOLOGISTS\n\"So we might've found a few pieces of pottery, a couple of pieces of [shotgun pellets], little pieces of lead that would've been used to fire out of a gun,\" she said.\nBut while many people may think archaeology is just about digging up artifacts, White encouraged a broader perspective about the field.\nThe excavation took place in the city's Lincolnville neighborhood. St. Augustine was established by the Spanish in 1565. (City of St. Augustine Archaeology Program via AP)\n\"Everyone associates archaeology with finding things, and it's really the information that we're after as archaeologists,\" White said. \nShe added, \"[It's] not what you find, but what you'd find out.\"\nOne of the most interesting takeaways was the amount of seeds in the moat, which had survived thanks to the environmental conditions.\n\"They were really well-preserved because it's kind of in the water table at this point in time. The water table has risen over the last few centuries,\" she noted. \nFor more Lifestyle articles, visit foxnews.com/lifestyle\n\"So we've just started working with an ethnobotanist ... and she's been starting to help us study these plant remains, these seeds. We're hoping to learn a lot more.\"\nWhite also said the redoubts were some of the only British-constructed fortifications in the city. When they took control of the territory, the British inhabitants usually reused Spanish infrastructure instead of building their own.\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER\n\"Everything else was either already here and the Spanish built it, and the British might've modified it a little -- but this was something that was uniquely British,\" she said. \"We know there's at least six additional [redoubts] out there.\"\nWhite added that she hopes the group finds \"evidence ... now that we sort of know what to look for, especially since there's not a lot of artifacts associated with them.\"\nSt. Augustine's city archeology program conducts over 60 projects a year, with archaeologists constantly learning more about the city's past. \nSt. Augustine archaeologists hope to conduct more excavations in the future, as the city's archeology program conducts dozens of projects per year. (City of St. Augustine Archaeology Program via AP)\nAt a time when many fascinating excavations are taking place across the world, from Europe to the Middle East, White emphasized the amount the U.S. has to offer in terms of archaeology. \n\"I think sometimes we're surprised: 'Wait, there's archaeology in America, in our own backyard?'\" she said. \"Yes, there is archaeology everywhere.\"\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\"It may not be as old as some people want to think, but there's stuff everywhere.

Dakota Meyer joins 'America's Newsroom' to explain why he's re-enlisting in the Marine reserves and what motivates his continued service to the country.\nIn a rare move for the U.S. military, Medal of Honor recipient Sgt. Dakota Meyer has re-enlisted in the Marine Corps Reserve after 15 years out of uniform. Meyer says the decision comes from a deep sense of unfinished duty and a desire to inspire others to serve.\n\"There's never been a better time to serve our country than right now,\" Meyer said Friday on \"America's Newsroom.\"\n \"There's never been a need, like we need right now, of good men and women who are willing to stand up and who are willing defend the beliefs of the American people, of the Constitution, and to protect all of those things against whatever enemy that is willing to try to step up and to try and threaten that.\"\nMeyer received the Medal of Honor for his heroic actions during a deadly 2009 battle in Afghanistan's Kunar Province. Amid intense gunfire, he repeatedly drove into the combat zone in a Humvee to rescue fellow Marines and Afghans, saving dozens of lives. He was awarded the nation's highest military honor by President Barack Obama in 2011.\nOn Thursday, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth administered the oath of enlistment during a ceremony at the Pentagon.

I didn't want to do it for recognition. I just did it because the mission never left me.\"\nHegseth noted that Meyer didn't request a public ceremony, but that his return to service deserved to be recognized.\n\"I want the American people.

It's an honor to be able to serve the purpose.

Ivor D. Thornton, 34, landed on Omaha Beach in Normandy with Company H, 2nd Battalion, 116th Infantry Regimental Combat Team, 29th Infantry Division as part of the second wave of the invasion, the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency said in a news release. D-Day, or Operation Overlord, was a massive Allied invasion of northern France by air and sea during World War II. The operation, on June 6, 1944, marked the beginning of the liberation of Europe from Hitler's rule. \nThe company disembarked from their landing craft at around 7 a.m. Fellow soldiers observed Thornton wading ashore, but he was not seen again after that, the DPAA said. The day after the invasion, Thornton's unit searched for him, but he was not found. He was officially listed as missing in action. His name was engraved on the Walls of the Missing at the Normandy American Cemetery in Colleville-sur-Mer, France. \nOn June 8, 1944, two days after D-Day, graves registration personnel recovered a set of remains from Omaha Beach that they were unable to identify, the DPAA said. The remains were interred at U.S. Military Cemetery Saint-Laurent-sur-Mer, near Omaha Beach, and marked as X-159 St. Laurent. \nIn 1945, an attempt was made to identify the unknown remains, but the effort was unsuccessful, the DPAA said. Analysts with the American Graves Registration Command failed to identify the remains again in 1947. Two years later, in 1949, a board of officers from the command recommended the remains be declared unidentifiable. \nIn April 2022, two families, including Thornton's, requested that X-159 be disinterred. The families asked that the remains be compared to those of Thornton and another soldier. The remains were exhumed in September 2023 and transferred to the DPAA laboratory. Scientists conducted dental and anthropological analyses and mitochondrial DNA analysis, the DPAA said. \nThose efforts finally identified the remains as belonging to Thornton. A rosette will be placed next to his name on the Walls of the Missing to indicate that he has been accounted for, the DPAA said, and he will be buried at the Arlington National Cemetery in Washington, D.C.\nKerry Breen is a news editor at CBSNews.com.

It's very difficult to get to, very expensive to get to.\"\nAs well as becoming far better travelled, the past year has also seen him expand his horizons in other ways, acting as an ambassador for Young Minds UK, a mental health charity for young people, and Winston's Wish, a children and young people's grief charity.\nOne of the most heart-rending moments of series four was when it was revealed that Watts's mum had died of cancer when he was just a child.\nSpeaking of his ambassadorial work, he says: \"I love it and I'm so glad that I get to have the opportunity [to help].\n \"But internalising it, it can be quite challenging, listening to people's stories.\"\nRace Across the World resumes on Wednesday, with a new raft of contestants heading this time from north eastern China to the southernmost tip of India.\nThey include ex-spouses Gaz and Yin, and current couple Fin and Sioned, as well as sisters Elizabeth and Letitia, brothers Brian and Melvyn and mother and son duo Caroline and Tom.\nThe rules, as usual, are no smart phones, no bank cards (just a small cash budget) and no air travel.\nWatts thinks it's going to be a \"really tough route\" and \"a topsy turvey\" series.\n\"China is very easy to get around but very hard to communicate,\" he stresses from personal experience. \"And a lot of China doesn't accept cash anymore.\"\nHis \"number one piece of advice\" for anyone taking part is to learn from his mistakes and take a calculator and a whiteboard. \"We had to borrow notebooks and God knows what else\".\nHe'd also suggest taking \"little travel placards\" with pictures of buses, trains and people on, for ease of communication.\n\"I think now there's more and more series, people are watching it and starting to think, 'actually, this is where they're going wrong. This is how we can be creative around it'.\n\"And I think we're probably going to see that this series, that people have been a lot more streetwise with how they've prepared.\"\nIs he worried about losing his title as the show's youngest winner?\nHe replies, like a true international diplomat, that he just wants the pair who \"nicely interact\" with the others and \"who genuinely appreciate the opportunity to travel\" to win.\n\"I think those are always the people that you want to do best, and if that happens to be the two 18-year-olds this time, then I'll be happy to hand my crown over.\"\nSeries five of Race Across the World begins on BBC One at 21:00 BST on Wednesday 23 April.\nMore than 18,000 passengers are expected to travel in and out of Jersey Airport over Easter weekend.\nDelays are expected for those travelling by car, plane and ferry for the Good Friday getaway.\nA section of New Castletown Road, near Quarterbridge, will be closed from 18:00 BST on Wednesday. \nAurigny says the review is determining the best aircraft to service the Guernsey-Alderney route.\nTravellers say they are being told they cannot fly to the EU even though their passports are valid.\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

      "published": "2025-04-19",
      "summary": "What is happening with US bonds, why Donald Trump cares and how ordinary Americans could be affected.",
      "content": "Stock markets around the world have been relatively settled this week after a period of chaos, sparked by US trade tariffs.\nBut investors are still closely watching a part of the market which rarely moves dramatically - the US bond market.\nGovernments sell bonds - essentially an IOU - to raise money for public spending and in return they pay interest.\nRecently, in an extremely rare move the rate the US government had to pay on its bonds rose sharply, while the price of bonds themselves fell.\nThe volatility suggests investors were losing confidence in the world's biggest economy.\nYou may think it's too esoteric to bother you, but here's why it matters and how it may change President Trump's mind on tariffs.\nWhen a government wants to borrow money, it usually does so by selling bonds - known as \"Treasuries\" in the US - to investors on financial markets.\nSuch payments are made over a number of pre-agreed years before a full and final payment is made when the bond \"matures\" - in other words, expires. \nInvestors who buy bonds are mainly made up of financial institutions, ranging from pension funds to central banks like the Bank of England.\nInvestors buy government bonds because they are seen as a safe place to invest their money. There is little risk a government will not repay the money, especially an economic superpower like the US.\nSo when the economy is turbulent and investors want to take money out of volatile stocks and shares markets, they usually place that cash in US bonds. \nBut recently that hasn't happened.\nInitially, following the so-called \"Liberation Day\" tariffs announcement on 2 April when shares fell, investors did appear to flock to US bonds. \nHowever, when the first of these tariffs kicked in on 5 April and Trump doubled down on his policies that weekend, investors began dumping government bonds, sending the interest rate the US government would have to pay to borrow money up sharply.\nThe so-called yield for US government borrowing over 10 years shot up from 3.9% to 4.5%, while the 30-year yield spiked at almost 5%. Movements of 0.2% in either direction are considered a big deal.\nWhy the dramatic sell-off? In short, the uncertainty over the impact of tariffs on the US economy led to investors no longer seeing government bonds as such a safe bet, so demanded bigger returns to buy them. \nThe higher the perceived risk, the higher the yield investors want to compensate for taking it.\nIf the US government is spending more on debt interest repayments, it can affect budgets and public spending as it becomes more costly for the government to sustain itself. \nBut it can also have a direct impact on households and even more so on businesses.\nJohn Canavan, lead analyst at Oxford Economics, says when investors charge higher rates to lend the government money, other rates for lending that have more risk attached, such as mortgages, credit cards and car loans, also tend to rise.\nBusinesses, especially small ones, are likely to be hardest hit by any immediate change in borrowing rates, as most homeowners in the US have fixed-rate deals of between 15 and 30 years. If businesses can't get access to credit, that can halt economic growth and lead to job losses over time.\nMr Canavan adds that banks can become more cautious in lending money, which could impact the US economy.\nFirst-time buyers and those wishing to move home could also face higher costs, he says, which could impact the housing market in the longer term. It's common in the US for small business owners starting out to use the equity in their home as collateral.\nFollowing the introduction of tariffs, Trump urged his nation to \"hang tough\", but it appears the potential threat to jobs and the US economy stopped the president in his tracks.\nFollowing the ructions in the bond markets, he introduced a 90-day pause for the higher tariffs on every country except China. The 10% blanket tariff, however, on all countries remains.\nIt proved a pressure point for Trump - and now the world knows it.\n\"Although President Donald Trump was able to resist the stock market sell-off, once the bond market began to weaken too, it was only a matter of time before he folded,\" says Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist at Capital Economics.\nAccording to US media reports, it was Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, inundated with calls from business leaders, who played a key part in swaying Trump. \nThe bond market reaction has led to comparisons with former UK Prime Minister Liz Truss's infamous mini-Budget of September 2022. The unfunded tax cuts announced then spooked investors, who dumped UK government bonds, resulting in the Bank of England stepping in to buy bonds to save pension funds from collapse.\nSome analysts suggested that America's central bank, the US Federal Reserve, might have been forced to step in if the sell-off had worsened.\nWhile bond yields have settled, some might argue the damage has already been done as they remain higher than before the blanket tariffs kicked in.\n\"Arguably the most worrying aspect of the [recent] turmoil... is an emerging risk premium in US Treasury bonds and the dollar, akin to what the UK experienced in 2022,\" according to Jonas Goltermann, deputy chief markets economist at Capital Economics.\nBut unless you're a first-time buyer or selling your home, Americans are unlikely to be immediately hit by higher mortgage costs, unlike Brits who were securing new shorter-term fixed deals.\nSince 2010, foreign ownership of US bonds has almost doubled, rising by $3 trillion, according to Deutsche Bank.\nJapan holds the most US Treasuries, but China, the US's arch enemy in this global trade war, is the second biggest holder of US government debt globally. \nQuestions were raised about whether it sparked the debt sell-off in response to being hit with huge tariffs.\nHowever, this is unlikely as any fire sale \"would impoverish China more than it would hurt the US\", according to Capital Economics.\nIranian and US officials agree to continue with a third round of high-stakes talks on a new nuclear deal.\nThe wartime Alien Enemies Act has been controversially used to deport Venezuelans to a mega-jail in El Salvador.\nThe accused gang members are being sent to a notorious jail in El Salvador under a 19th-Century law.\nThe US says the attack on the Red Sea coast aimed to restrict supplies and funds for the Houthis, who called it a war crime.\nSen Chris Van Hollen returned from El Salvador and spoke about his time meeting with Kilmar Abrego Garcia.\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

      "ml_hf_summary": "US bond yields have increased sharply in recent weeks, signaling investor uncertainty regarding the US economy and its response to tariffs. Following President Trump's imposition of tariffs on goods from various countries, investors initially sought refuge in US bonds but later dumped them as concerns about economic impact grew. This resulted in a significant increase in interest rates for US government borrowing, impacting mortgage rates, business loans, and potentially slowing economic growth.  While the bond market has stabilized somewhat, the long-term effects of this volatility remain to be seen. The situation is reminiscent of similar events in the UK with former Prime Minister Liz Truss's mini-budget, highlighting potential risks for the US economy. \n"

He has been contacted by the BBC for comment.\nShe left Dubai, where she had been living with her partner, to move back in with her family in the UK - and had to lay off most of the companies' staff.\n\"It was very humbling and very difficult,\" Lilly said, explaining she had to go back to doing the work she used to have staff for - such as editing, filming her videos, and running the business' social media feeds.\nIt meant even though she was trying her best to avoid it, Lilly was constantly engaging with social media platforms to keep her businesses going - and she had to try to avoid looking at myriad personal comments.\n\"I was trying to manage the heartbreak and the shock combined with keeping the business afloat,\" she said.\nHer most recent Instagram post until now, on her personal account, was uploaded in November 2023 - with many of the comments asking why she has not posted for so long.\nUp until the gossip podcast launched, Lilly had been open about her life online.\nAnd she accepted there may have \"potentially\" been less interest in her relationship had she shared less on social media.\n\"I truly don't know the answer to that,\" she said.\n\"I think when I compare to some other people, I didn't show a lot of my lifestyle.\n\"But it was clearly enough for people to put two and two together.\"\nLilly acknowledged she had shared snapshots about herself to help build her brand - to draw in those who wanted to know more about her - and for a long time it was a successful strategy.\nWhile she maintained some boundaries such as not revealing information about her family, she said there was always an unspoken pressure to share more.\n\"I've learned people will constantly want more the more you give,\" she said.\n\"If it's just showing your dog, or sharing your relationship, it's like 'okay, what else, now show the house'.\n\"It can lead to a lot of exposure because you're chasing likes or you feel that's what your customers want.\"\nNearly eighteen months after her most recent post, Lilly is in a different headspace. \nHer business - the workout videos and a nutrition app - are thriving and she feels ready to return to her personal Instagram account - but with a very different set of rules this time around.\n\"I'm not going to be showing my personal relationships, I've been too scarred, and I can't do it again,\" she said.\nMinecraft players have spent about 15,000 hours in total on the project to build London and the UK\nArtists hit back on social media to warn artificial intelligence may be endangering their livelihoods.\nChina sits at the heart of Apple's supply chain - and has benefited hugely from it.

His counterpart Amir Khan Muttaqi expressed \"deep concern\" about deportations.\nSome expelled Afghans at the border said they had been born in Pakistan after their families fled conflict.\nMore than 3.5 million Afghans have been living in Pakistan, according to the UN's refugee agency, including around 700,000 people who came after the Taliban takeover in 2021. The UN estimates that half are undocumented.\nPakistan has taken in Afghans through decades of war, but the government says the high number of refugees now poses risks to national security and causes pressure on public services.\nThere has been a recent spike in border clashes between the security forces of both sides. Pakistan blames them on militants based in Afghanistan, which the Taliban deny.\nPakistan's foreign ministry said the two sides had \"discussed all issues of mutual interest\" in Saturday's meeting in Kabul.\nPakistan had extended a deadline for undocumented Afghans to leave the country by a month, to 30 April.\nOn the Torkham border crossing, some expelled Afghans told the BBC they left Afghanistan decades ago - or had never lived there.\n\"I lived my whole life in Pakistan,\" said Sayed Rahman, a second-generation refugee born and raised in Pakistan. \"I got married there. What am I supposed to do now?\" \nSaleh, a father of three daughters, worried what life under Taliban rule will mean for them. His daughters attended school in Pakistan's Punjab province, but in Afghanistan, girls over the age of 12 are barred from doing so.\n\"I want my children to study. I don't want their years in school to go to waste,\" he said. \"Everyone has the right to an education.\"\nAnother man told the BBC: \"Our children have never seen Afghanistan and even I don't know what it looks like anymore. It might take us a year or more to settle in and find work. We feel helpless.\"\nAt the border, men and women pass through separate gates, under the watch of armed Pakistani and Afghan guards. Some of those returning were elderly - one man was carried across on a stretcher, another in a bed. \nMilitary trucks shuttled families from the border to temporary shelters. Those originally from distant provinces stay there for several days, waiting for transport to their home regions.\nFamilies clustered under canvases to escape the 30C degree heat, as swirling dust caught in the eyes and mouth. Resources are stretched and fierce arguments often break out over access to shelter.\nReturnees receive between 4,000 and 10,000 Afghanis (PS41 to PS104) from the Kabul authorities, according to Hedayatullah Yad Shinwari, a member of the camp's Taliban-appointed finance committee.\nThe mass deportation is placing significant pressure on Afghanistan's fragile infrastructure, with an economy in crisis and a population nearing 45 million people.\n\"We have resolved most issues, but the arrival of people in such large numbers naturally brings difficulties,\" said Bakht Jamal Gohar, the Taliban's head of refugee affairs at the crossing. \"These people left decades ago and left all their belongings behind. Some of their homes were destroyed during 20 years of war.\"\nNearly every family told the BBC that Pakistani border guards restricted what they could bring - a complaint echoed by some human rights groups.\nChaudhry said in response that Pakistan did \"not have any policy that prevents Afghan refugees from taking their household items with them\".\nOne man, sitting on the roadside in the blistering sun, said his children had begged to stay in Pakistan, the country where they were born. They had been given temporary residency, but that expired in March.\n\"Now we'll never go back. Not after how we were treated,\" he said.\nAdditional reporting by Daniel Wittenberg and Mallory Moench\nThe Rahimi family wants to say thank you to the Northallerton community for welcoming them.\nSources say half a million US weapons obtained by the Taliban have been lost, sold or smuggled to militant groups.\nThe Afghanistan Cricket Board will not see any of its funding from the International Cricket Council cut or diverted to its exiled women's cricketers.\nThe BBC speaks to young women who are now working to support their families in one of few jobs they are allowed to do.\nThe ICC announces the formation of a dedicated taskforce to support displaced female cricketers from Afghanistan.\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

      "summary": "Wrestling's main event is to stream live on Netflix for the first time - here's why it matters.",
      "content": "Millions of wrestling fans across the world are gearing up for this weekend's much-anticipated annual finale - WrestleMania 41.\nJust ask seven-year-old Oliver, who's spent the past week of his school holidays waking his dad, Paul, at 6:30 to eagerly count down the days.\nHe's even being allowed to get up at midnight to watch it, because, as one of the 17 million UK households subscribed to Netflix, the family now has live ringside access to the two-night Las Vegas extravaganza.\nIt means Oliver will finally get to find out if 16-time champion John Cena, who's recently flipped from hero to villain as part of his farewell tour (leaving Oliver in shock), can defeat Cody Rhodes in a record-breaking win before retirement.\nIt's all part of a $5bn (PS4bn) mega-deal bringing World Wrestling Entertainment's (WWE) archive and biggest events to the streamer - with WrestleMania now available live on Netflix in many international territories for the very first time. US viewers, however, will still be watching on NBC's Peacock, at least for now.\nThe 10-year contract, which began earlier this year, connects WWE with a potential global audience of 700 million. It's central to WWE chief content officer Paul 'Triple H' Levesque's vision of making wrestling globally accessible and relevant to a new generation of streaming era fans.\nThe stakes are high. WrestleMania, which began in 1985, is being treated as a litmus test - not just for WWE's global expansion, but for Netflix's potential move into live sports.\nBut will this blockbuster tag-team partnership pay off, or will it prove one (very) expensive fight too far?\nThe Netflix/WWE deal reflects changes in viewing habits, and also speaks to WWE's eagerness to be promoted by the \"winner of the streaming wars\", the Wrestlenomics website editor Brandon Thurston tells the BBC.\nAfter years of relying on cable pay-per-view - which charged US viewers a hefty $60 (PS45) per event - WWE launched its own network in 2014. The company took most of its pay-per-view events in house, aware that half the revenue was being lost to satellite companies.\nThe move paid off, says Thurston, as prices for pay-per-view events dropped significantly to around $10 (PS7.50), creating \"a larger audience than ever\".\nThe Netflix deal is, according to Thurston, part of WWE's plans to recruit globally, create bigger international stars, and amplify its live tournaments such as Raw, WrestleMania and Smackdown across different markets.\nAs WWE's Levesque told the Ankler podcast, Netflix's universal \"simplicity\" felt game-changing: \"No matter where you are in the globe, there it is right in front of you. It's one click, and you're on and you're in\".\nGood thing too, as Levesque says younger audiences have \"no concept\" of traditional television, and increasingly view on-demand streaming as the norm, alongside video platforms like YouTube and TikTok.\nIt's certainly made Oliver a megafan, and he is now able to watch the weekly Smackdown and Raw shows with his dad. Previously, without a TNT sport subscription, his options were limited to the monthly events available on the WWE network.\n\"Now that WWE is on Netflix, he watches it probably four times a week. It's his go-to programme,\" says Paul.\n\"It's really opened up a huge door for him. What's great for me as a dad is I used to be into wrestling when I was his age as well, so it's nice to share that journey with him\".\nAnd he's far from alone. On Thursday, industry magazine Broadcast reported that the move to Netflix had significantly increased UK engagement with both shows, with Raw ranked among the platform's top 10 shows in nine of its first 10 weeks.\nThe picture is less clear in the US. Back in February, Mark Shapiro, a chief at WWE parent company TKO, told investors that Raw viewership was up 13% for the year to date compared to its previous home on USA Network - rising to 38% if the heavily promoted opening night is included.\nHowever, Thurston's research suggests that Raw and Smackdown viewership has since levelled off to numbers seen on USA.\nAnd figures are continuing to fall, not to an alarming amount, but certainly indicating that, potentially, weekly events on the streamer may not be as much of a growth area as major live events.\nRegardless, he sees the trade-off as worth it for Netflix in the long run - particularly looking ahead to WrestleMania's global debut tonight, which is expected to break streaming records. \nWhen former longtime WWE CEO Vince McMahon dreamt up WrestleMania more than 40 years ago, he envisaged a Superbowl-style set piece event to unite the franchise's commercial partnerships and burrow it deeper within popular culture.\nThat's why 1985's first WrestleMania was heavily promoted through MTV and held at New York's Madison Square Garden - featuring everyone from wrestler Hulk Hogan to A-team actor Mr T, popstar Cyndi Lauper and Muhammad Ali as a referee.\n\"We were trying to make a statement as to what our business is,\" McMahon told Netflix's 2024 docuseries, \"all forms of entertainment rolled into one\".\nAnd yet despite turning WWE into a media empire, McMahon departed in disgrace - first in 2022 and then again in 2024, amid various controversies - including an ongoing sexual harassment lawsuit. McMahon's attorney, Jessica Rosenberg, denied the claims.\nThurston feels McMahon's tight grip on creative business decisions also stifled WWE's storytelling in later years. Under Levesque, Thurston says that's changed in favour of collaboration. He says stories feel fresher, gender representation has improved and US event attendance is up.\nFor Jonny Pivaral, who grew up watching during what he calls McMahon's \"bra and panties match\" era of the 2000s, the evolution is welcome. \"Back then, women were just eye candy,\" he says. \"Now they're being showcased on the same level as the men.\"\nThis shift will be on full display when women's wrestling storylines take centre stage at WrestleMania. Top stars Rhea Ripley, Bianca Belair, and IYO SKY are to face off in a triple-threat match, while women's champion Tiffany Stratton will fight the legendary Charlotte Flair - in a battle that underlines the division's growing value.\nAttracting new audiences matters, Thurston says, because WWE's global strategy now hinges on fees paid by cities hosting these events (including WrestleMania), both inside and outside the USA.\n\"They want WrestleMania to become like the World Cup or Olympics, where there's a bidding war,\" he explains. \"Las Vegas is paying them $5 million for this year's event,\" he adds, noting that London has been heavily touted as a potential WrestleMania host city.\nFinding a home on a streaming giant may be great news for WWE - but what does Netflix stand to gain from the partnership?\nAccording to James English, managing partner at sports and entertainment marketing agency Fuse, Netflix is \"stating loud and clear that it wants to dominate 'sportainment'\".\nThe WWE streaming deal is, he says, a major reason why Netflix beat expectations with its financial figures on Thursday, delivering 13% revenue growth for the first quarter of 2025.\nEnglish sees WrestleMania as the natural progression in their drive to use sport to attract viewers to \"cultural moments\".\nThis began last November with Mike Tyson taking on YouTuber Jake Paul in an influencer-boxing hybrid bout that drew in 60 million households - perhaps benefitting from cross-generational appeal.\nThis first foray into live sports attracted complaints of crashing and buffering but the issues were largely fixed for Netflix's two NFL matches on Christmas Day a month later, part of a new three-year deal to show Christmas Day fixtures.\nEnglish says that unlike Apple or Amazon Prime, which bought packages to the Major League Soccer (MLS) and the Premier League, Netflix's focus on \"event\" viewing allows them to make best use of their personalised advert and interface data.\nWrestleMania exemplifies this strategy. As a \"live, global, fan-driven deal that blends sports, entertainment and storytelling\", English says Netflix could stand to make huge profits from its WWE partnership.\nThe big question, of course, is whether wider Netflix audience interest will last the rounds.\nBut it may be a gamble worth taking - for all involved. Just ask Oliver and his Dad at midnight.\nScottish professional wrestler Ravie Davie left gang life to teach kids how to wrestle.\nBen Osborn runs mentoring sessions in schools and said the Netflix show had \"blindsided\" parents.\nA CMS committee report warns of the need to safeguard \"culturally distinct British productions\".\nA Manchester drama school attended by Adolescence star Owen Cooper says he he was \"quietly confident\".\nThe unsettling tech-driven anthology is back for a seventh series and there's no shortage of material.\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

      "content": "Disabled people should be more fairly recognised in the honours system as part of the government's push to make awards reach a wider range of people, says Carly Jones, an advocate for the rights of autistic women and girls.\nBut she tells BBC News she has seen firsthand how people's attitudes need to change, including after she was appointed MBE in 2018.\nCarly remembers being at a doctors' surgery where there was a call for a Miss Emby. \n\"We're all looking round and I said: 'Is it Jones MBE'?\" realising the award had been mistaken for a surname.\n\"You don't look like the sort of person who would have one,\" Carly was told.\n\"I don't know what that meant,\" says Carly, who campaigns to help women with autism in education, employment and health services.\nNot only was Carly appointed MBE, she's on one of the honours committees that decides who else should receive an award, such as knighthoods, CBEs, MBEs and OBEs, in the New Year and King's Birthday Honours.\nAs a disabled woman herself, she wants to make sure the charity and community work of people with disabilities isn't overlooked and taken for granted.\nAn important part of that is to encourage more people to put forward nominations.\n\"Everyone knows someone who deserves an honour,\" says Carly, who wants to \"challenge the myth that this is a system for the elite\". \nIn terms of the honours committee, she says: \"We can only look at what's put in front of us.\"\nThere is also a concern, she says, that people shouldn't think that someone has received an award just because of a disability - \"because that would devalue the system\".\nThere is scrutiny to make sure that those receiving awards of all types have personally worked very hard for good causes. \"It can't just be someone who donates a million pounds and then gets a knighthood,\" she says.\nCarly, who wasn't diagnosed with autism until she was an adult, experienced homelessness and lived in a hostel, and she wants the honours to reflect those who have come from a difficult position but have made a big difference helping others.\nThe Cabinet Office says the number of people with mental and physical disabilities receiving awards has been increasing over the past decade - from 6.3% of recipients in the New Year Honours in 2015 to 15% in the list for 2025.\nThese were not broken down by type or level of award, but overall it is the highest number to date of disabled award winners.\nIt's a positive sign in the push for the honours to be more representative, but it is still below the proportion of people with disabilities, with the 2021 census figures suggesting almost 18% of people in England and Wales had a disability.\nSir Stephen Timms, Minister for Social Security and Disability, said he was \"delighted to see more disabled people rightly recognised and celebrated for their remarkable achievements\".\nBut the government has accepted there are wider problems with many groups being under-represented in the honours - in terms of geography and social class - particularly in the higher awards, such as knighthoods, damehoods and CBEs.\nAn independent chair is going to be recruited to improve diversity and outreach within the honours process - and Carly says they will be checking through all levels of awards.\nIt follows a BBC analysis revealing that in the most recent New Year Honours only 6% of higher awards went to people in the north of England and 4% to people from working-class backgrounds.\nThe most recent New Year Honours had been presented as recognising \"unsung heroes\" and \"community champions\". But in practice the higher awards were heavily skewed towards people from wealthier backgrounds, particularly in London and the south-east.\nPrime Minister Sir Keir Starmer says he wants the honours system to be \"properly diverse and reflective of UK society\".\nSign up here to get the latest royal stories and analysis every week with our Royal Watch newsletter.

      "summary": "The singer describes the troubled gestation of her third album, as she launches it on the West End.",
      "content": "\"Please be upstanding for the world's most confusing House of Games contestant and Bake Off failure, Self Esteem!\"\nThis is how Rebecca Lucy Taylor - aka celebrated pop singer Self Esteem - is introduced to the stage at London's Duke of York's Theatre.\nIt's a typically irreverent comment, an example of the dry wit she uses to sweeten the sincerity and anger of her music.\n\"You can take piccies and videos,\" the off-stage voice continues, \"because she needs all the help she can get.\"\nThat, too, is strictly tongue-in-cheek.\nThree years ago, Taylor released her second album, Prioritise Pleasure, a body-shaking manifesto for female self-worth that bristled at society's expectations while acknowledging her own shortcomings (\"Sexting you at the mental health talk seems counterproductive,\" she observed on Moody).\nAfter 10 years in mid-ranking indie band Slow Club, the album propelled her into uncharted realms.\nThere were magazine covers, nominations for the Mercury Prize and Brit Awards, a starring role on stage in Cabaret, a support slot with Adele and, yes, an appearance on Celebrity Bake Off - where, unfortunately, she burned her crumpets.\n\"The week that Prioritise Pleasure came out, my whole life changed,\" she reflects.\n\"Not financially or in terms of fame, but it's like there was a knot in my stomach that untied.\n\"Then everyone was like, 'Right, can you do that again, please?'\"\nTaylor tore herself in two to make the follow-up, A Complicated Woman, which comes out on Friday.\nAfter playing it live for the first time in the West End on Wednesday, she describes the album's gestation process as \"horrible\", \"lonely\", and \"painful\".\n\"It just felt really stressful to execute what was in my head,\" she explains in a phone interview the next morning.\n\"I was thinking so big, but I still don't have access to the resources I need to make it as big as I wanted.\"\nPart of the problem was a punishing, but self-imposed, time limit.\n\"The music industry is like, 'You've got 10 minutes, then you're over and someone else is going to take your place',\" she explains.\n\"So I felt like I had no choice [but to commit to another record] if I wanted to build on what I'd done.\n\"But as painful as it was and as dark as it got, the second I'm back on stage performing it, I'm like, 'Oh, this is why I love it'.\"\nShe hasn't just made a new album - she has also created a daring, jaw-dropping theatrical experience to go with it.\nIt's set in a sparse recreation of the community centre where eight-year-old Becky from Rotherham learned to tap dance.\n\"You just wanted to sing / You didn't know what that would bring,\" recalls an older, more cynical version of that child - as she assesses her life at the age of 38.\n\"This really is all there is, and that's what you've got to get comfortable with.\" \nAs the show opens, 10 dancers line up on either side of her, dressed in austere outfits that recall The Handmaid's Tale.\nInitially, their movements are stiff and restricted but, as Taylor describes suffocating relationships with emotionally-stunted men, they start to thrash and jerk their bodies.\n\"We start in that world where we're shackled, and then we exorcise it,\" Taylor explains.\n\"Over the course of the show, it all unravels and everyone ends up being themselves instead of conforming to these societal norms.\"\nA four-night theatre residency is an unusual way to launch an album. The audience is unfamiliar with most of the songs, and no-one's sure whether to absorb the performance attentively, or sing along and dance.\nSeveral times, laughter ripples through the theatre as the singer's more acerbic observations hit home. The following morning, she's not quite sure what to make of the reaction.\n\"Every time people laugh, my heart sinks,\" she says. \"But then I'm like, the lyrics are funny, aren't they?\n\"And I love changing the laughter into emotion. It feels like people are laughing because it's uncomfortable.\"\nIn the end, the audience members mirror the on-stage narrative. Shaking off their discomfort, they rise out of their seats and start making an almighty racket.\nThe music becomes a soundtrack to solidarity - which, it transpires, was Taylor's intention. \nA Complicated Woman might be as cutting and powerful as its predecessor, but the melodies were designed for stadiums.\n\"Do you remember the Elbow song One Day Like This?\" she asks. \"The one that goes, 'Throw those curtains wii-iide'?\n\"I went mad for that song when it came out and, honestly, I played it over and over in the studio and said, 'I want to do this'.\"\n\"I was very inspired by trying to make it onto World Cup montages. That's a genre of music that I really, really enjoy.\"\nThat's only half the story, though. The album is all about capturing the complex and contradictory impulses of a woman in her mid-30s.\nRecent single 69, for example, is a thumping house track on which Taylor talks with withering candour about her sex life. Imagine Madonna's Justify My Love, if she was really being honest.\n\"It's an idea I had for ages, of listing sex positions and scoring them so that there's no grey area [for prospective partners],\" the singer laughs. \n\"But there's a more political element, which is that women still aren't saying what they want in the bedroom. And I'm like, I can't bear this any more. Please let us just enjoy having sex.\n\"It's not exactly going to win an Ivor Novello Award for lyrics, but I think it stands on the album with moments that are more emotional and deep.\"\nThose moments include The Curse, a rousing ballad about using alcohol to dull her anxiety, which is possibly the best song Self Esteem's ever written.\nHer personal favourite, however, is called In Plain Sight. A collaboration with South African musician Moonchild Sanelly, it's a response to the criticism they've both received for speaking their minds.\n\"The world is saying who I am, but I thought I knew myself all these years,\" says Sanelly in a semi-improvised rap. \n\"I shrink to keep the peace, hoping I don't shake my purpose.\"\nIt's a feeling Taylor immediately recognised. \nAs excitement built around Prioritise Pleasure in 2021, she started getting \"nasty messages\" on social media, which shook her up.\n\"I was really shocked the first time I got grief, because no-one's ever been that bothered about what I'm doing,\" she says.\n\"People say you should ignore it, but if you went to a wedding and had a nice day and one person called you an [expletive], who would you go home thinking about? It's just human nature.\"\nEventually, the criticism took its toll.\n\"There were moments where I considered giving up, which shocked me because I've been this defiant, angry thing for so long,\" she says.\n\"But over the last few years, especially with the world being like it is, I've definitely had feelings of protecting myself and shutting up.\n\"That's the saddest part of the album, really. But I found a way through.\n\"And if I can, then I hope the rest of the world can too, you know?\"\nThat realisation is the connecting tissue of A Complicated Woman.\nLife is never easy, she says. No-one is ever truly satisfied. Relationships are hard work. You can't please everyone. But that's OK. You're OK. Trust your gut.\nShe sums it up on Focus Is Power, held aloft by the sound of a gospel choir: \"And now I see it clear with every passing of each year / I deserve to be here.\"\nOn stage in London, she sings those final lines a capella with her dancers and backing singers, arms wrapped around each other in a display of female solidarity.\nIt's a cathartic moment after the bruising process of putting the album together.\n\"There's so much joy in being a woman and just being yourself can be beautiful,\" she says. \"You've just got to find a way to do it.\"\nWith that, she's off to make tweaks for the show's second night. After that, she has to find a way to scale down the West End production for a UK tour.\n\"I'll do what I can to make it continue, but it's a huge risk because there's so little revenue from anything else,\" she says. \nUltimately, though, her ambition is undimmed.\n\"I want to make 20 albums, I want to do bigger theatre shows,\" she says.\n\"Of course it'd be useful if I could 'cross over' because everything gets easier when you've got more resources.\n\"But last night I was like, 'Bloody hell, you did what you set out to do'. So I'm good.\"\nMemories are being sought of the heady early days of rave.\nThe new Disney project, titled Star Wars: Starfighter, is set to be released in May 2027.\nThe singer says he feels there is an \"unspoken law\" that celebrities should always be accessible.\nJonny Fox is displaying his paintings at an exhibition called Back Story in Seaford, East Sussex. \nThe exhibition features artists who visited Newcastle, such as Jimi Hendrix and Ella Fitzgerald.\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

      "content": "Introducing a tourism tax in Wales would be a \"very risky economic move\" which could jeopardise jobs and businesses, the UK's largest holiday let provider has claimed.\nCharging people extra for overnight stays would mean \"taxing something you really want to encourage\", said Ben Spier of Sykes Holiday Cottages.\nThe Welsh government wants people staying overnight in Wales to pay PS1.30 plus VAT per night for hotels, B&Bs and self-catering accommodation, and 80p plus VAT for hostels and campsites, possibly from 2027, if passed by the Senedd.\nIt said the levy could raise up to PS33m per year to support and improve tourism in local areas and that councils would choose whether to charge it.\nThe Welsh government said it believed \"it is fair that everyone contributes towards the services they use\".\nTourism employs nearly 160,000 people in Wales, and is thought to be worth between PS3bn and PS4bn to the economy.\nAlthough children would be exempt from lower cost accommodation like camping, if approved, the levy would also apply to people who live in Wales.\nMr Spier, of Sykes, which has 22,500 UK properties including more than 4,000 in Wales, said: \"I don't think a tourism levy necessarily says to visitors, 'you're not welcome'. But I think it's just pure economics. I just think it's a very risky economic move.\"\nHe added: \"There is a risk of just making Wales that bit less competitive.\n\"We've seen the largest theme park in Wales close in the last few weeks because of increasing costs... is this really what you want to be putting a tax on?\"\nHe said there was a risk border towns might suffer if people choose areas in England where there was no tax, \"only jeopardising those that rely on those tourist jobs\".\nWith customers looking for competitive prices, he said operators might absorb the tax themselves, warning: \"You're absolutely risking either that you're increasing prices and that you risk driving tourists away from Wales altogether, or you're hitting the bottom line for operators who may choose to do something else.\n\"So there's a ripple effect across the economy from local suppliers and contractors to cultural attractions.\"\nLike some others in the sector, he was concerned overnight stays were being targeted, while day-trippers - which some believe put more pressure on local services and contribute much less economically - would not pay the levy.\nLaura Tenison owns Wonderful Escapes near Abergavenny, Monmouthshire, where she has 16 bedrooms and specialises in business and wellness retreats.\nClose to the border, she can see seven counties on her evening walk - five of them in England.\nShe said she believed a tourist tax \"makes sense\" in places with a high tourist concentration in a small area like Edinburgh, where \"there's a massive shortage of accommodation\".\nBut Wales was very different, she said, and \"we're already seriously struggling to encourage inbound tourists to the UK to visit\".\nNot opposed to raising money from tourists, she said: \"Apparently, it costs PS10 to have an Instagram picture at Land's End nowadays.\n\"Why don't we do that for Tenby High Street or any of the highest peaks of the mountains? If that's the case, where we are absolutely drowning in tourists, we can tax them at point of use. \n\"But don't make this a national issue that is only going to be negative publicity for those inbound tourists who may or may not be considering Wales, and have a detrimental effect on the industry already struggling to fill their nights.\"\nIf a tax is introduced, Ms Tenison said there was \"absolutely no way that I am going to impose this on my guests\", and her business would \"swallow it\".\nIt comes as an industry body has warned thousands of tourism jobs could be lost in Wales without changes to holiday let rules. \nDr Linda Osti, senior lecturer in tourism management at Bangor Business School, prepared a report for the Welsh government and studied five areas in the world operating a levy.\nVenice recently introduced an entrance tax for day visitors to counter over-tourism at peak times of the season.\nShe said she believed a levy in specific areas - rather than councils imposing it county-wide - would work in Wales.\n\"We cannot say that the same recipe works for every single destination in Gwynedd, and so it's the same talking about south or south west Wales,\" she said.\n\"The same recipe cannot work so there is a need to be more tailored to different tourism destinations.\"\nShe agreed a tourism tax might initially see a drop in visitor numbers in some areas, but long-term numbers could recover if tax revenue is used to improve services for visitors.\n\"I think the doors are open,\" she said, adding: \"It's just about implementing it in the correct way and I think Wales has the potential to let it work.\"\nSteven Hesketh, director of Hotel Wrexham in Holt, is fully behind a tourism levy in Wales, but one that is managed by the industry. \nHe is chief executive of Savvy Hotels group and vice chairman of the Liverpool Accommodation Business Improvement District (BID).\nThe BID sees hoteliers and other members paying into a pot which is used to invest in improving experiences and attracting large events and more visitors. \nBut they were balloting to switch to a new model where visitors would pay PS2 plus VAT per hotel room, within a designated area of the city. The BID board would then decide where to invest.\nHe said he believed a similar model would be best for Wales.\n\"I think most businesses have that general feeling that when money goes into the big conglomerate that is the government or local council, that maybe you don't see every pound that goes into there, because it can be used for other necessary funds,\" he added.\n\"That's not a criticism of local councils or government, but actually for this particular fund we want total transparency, total responsibility, of where every penny goes.\n\"Those at the forefront of the industry... are best placed to know where to spend that money.\"\nLocal business owners have said they hope the scheme will \"give some respite to residents\".\nThe theme park, loved by generations of Welsh children, closed suddenly in March. \nTravellers are warned of disruption as workers stage industrial action over pay and conditions.\nControversial plans to build a new hydrogen energy facility in Bridgend have been given the go-ahead.\nShrewsbury Flower Show began in 1875 but organisers said they could no longer continue due to costs.\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

      "ml_hf_summary": "The Welsh government proposes a tourism tax, charging £1.30 per night for hotels/B&Bs and £0.80 for hostels/campsites, potentially starting in 2027. The aim is to raise up to £33 million annually to support local tourism.  Sykes Holiday Cottages argues this could negatively impact the economy by making Wales less competitive and risking job losses.  The Welsh government believes a tax on overnight stays is fair as it contributes to services used by tourists.  Dr Linda Osti, a tourism expert, suggests targeted taxes in specific areas might be more effective than a county-wide levy.  Some business owners support the idea of a tourism tax managed by the industry, with transparency and accountability being key concerns. \n"

I know how to swim, I know where this pool is, I've got my swimming costume.\n\"But we're still thinking this is the same as if I was going down to the local swimming baths.\"\nMr Park added that people did not always take into the account the \"dangers\" when travelling to the location.\n\"It's cold up there, you've now got this big journey to get back and that's when we're seeing the accidents happen,\" he added. \nMr Jones said \"start early enough\" to ensure there was enough daylight for the return leg and consider rescheduling if the weather was unpredictable.\n\"Wear suitable clothes, bring food, drink, a torch with a spare battery, a map, a compass - and also make sure you know how to use them,\" he said. \n\"Getting to the top is only halfway.

      "content": "A mum was left shocked and upset after her five-year-old daughter came home from school with a letter describing her as overweight.\nNatasha, from Blaenavon, Torfaen, was informed Willow was 3ft 8in (112cm) tall and weighed about three stone 7lb (22.6kg) - this meant she was slightly above the \"healthy weight\" category using the body mass index (BMI) system.\nWales has a \"significant problem\" with childhood obesity, according to one expert, with more than 25% of children aged four to five overweight.\nThe Welsh government said measuring the height and weight of reception children was important to help give them the best start in life.\nDespite the intentions, the categorisation shocked Natasha, as Willow takes part in gymnastics, dancing and swimming every week and has a balanced diet.\n\"I understand why they do it, to gather statistics for an overall population, but it's not accurate in the slightest,\" she said. \n\"It's such a demoralising approach, labelling children in such a manner, solely based on BMI.\n\"BMI is such an outdated approach, [providing] misleading information. There needs to be multiple factors that can represent a child's health, not just a tick-box exercise.\"\nBMI is a measure of whether someone is a healthy weight for their height. \nThe NHS website states BMI scores have \"some limitations\" because the system measures whether a person is carrying too much weight, but not too much fat. \nNatasha, 29, wants the system overhauled, and has started a petition calling for it to \"take in the bigger picture\" of lifestyle and health.\nThe healthcare support worker described being \"so disheartened\" by the letter seen by BBC Wales.\nIt stated calculating children's weight categories could help parents make informed choices on lifestyles.\nThe school had told her about health checks taking place last month, which would include eyesight and hearing assessments, as well as measurements.\nNatasha believed any results would take a \"holistic approach\", including questionnaires sent to parents. \nBut the way it was done had left her worried about the \"negative psychological impact\" of the labels. \n\"I was angry and so upset,\" Natasha said. \n\"I've grown up being told I was overweight and I needed to lose weight, and I've done everything in my power to make sure Willow doesn't have any of that.\"\nThe Child Measurement Scheme is Welsh government-led, and coordinated by Public Health Wales. \nIt sees school nursing teams measure the height and weight of every reception pupil, unless their parents opt out.\nA letter is then sent to parents, explaining how they can see their child's results.\nAt the end of the school year, the anonymised results are analysed for trends at local health board level and national levels.\nPublic Health Wales said the information was used to \"plan services and inform changes to help families enjoy a healthy and active lifestyle\".\nIn the letter Natasha received, it signposted parents towards its Every Child Wales initiative, for \"useful information on helping children stay fit and healthy\".\nCardiff University's Prof Adrian Edwards, who is director of the Health and Care Research Wales Evidence Centre, said the country had a \"significant problem\" with childhood obesity.\nHe added more than 25% of Welsh children aged four to five were overweight, compared to about 11% across the UK and 7% on average in other high-income countries. \n\"All the health problems we would recognise and understand - including mental health problems, arthritis, high blood pressure, diabetes, cancer risk and all sorts of things - they are higher risk because of overweight and obesity, which starts in childhood,\" he said.\nHe admitted some scientific research showed BMI was not always accurate.\nProf Edwards cited the example of professional rugby players who can score as obese, \"but most of them are actually just full of muscle\".\nAnother example, he said, was children's bodies changing as they grow.\nHowever, he emphasised the need for \"a balance to be struck between accuracy and consistency\".\n\"They've been doing the same thing over 20, 30 years,\" he said. \n\"So, leaving aside the nuances of who might or might not be being incorrectly categorised at the edges, I think it's telling us something about the mainstream, the typical picture.\n\"The question is what you do with this information. Is it about diagnosing an individual who should then have some extra attention and support? \n\"Or is it actually about understanding the problem at population level, perhaps without singling out individuals?\"\nThe Welsh government said measuring the height and weight of reception children was \"part of our routine child development programme Healthy Child Wales which is important in improving children's health and giving them the best start in life\".\nA spokesperson added: \"Being consistent in how school nurses measure children allows Public Health Wales to assess trends over time at a population level.\"\nSteven Duffield, who weighed nearly 30 stone when he got stuck in a turnstile, walks back to health.\nThe nine colleagues are planning to jump from 13,000ft.\nDrinks such as sugar-free squash are off the menu for young children, say health advisers.\nOne in four children in year five in States schools are either overweight or obese, new data says.\nPlans to restrict a list of foods classed as unhealthy in shops are approved by 25 votes to 24.\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

She is instead named among the replacements.\nKeeping her company on the bench is GB Sevens player Catherine Richards who is set for her first tournament outing.\nEdel McMahon returns to captain Ireland who are looking to cement their \"best of the rest\" status, with England and France once again set for a Grand Slam decider.\nThe openside flanker missed last week's defeat by England through injury and is recalled to replace Erin King who has been ruled out of the rest of the tournament and the World Cup because of a serious knee injury.\nThere are four other changes to the side, with Siobhan McCarthy making her first Test start at loose-head prop, with Ruth Campbell coming into the second row.\nEnya Breen returns in midfield while Molly Scuffil-McCabe makes her first appearance of the campaign at scrum-half.\nSadhbh McGrath and Claire Boles are recalled to the bench.\nThis video can not be played\nWales head coach Sean Lynn reflects on his first month in Test rugby\nWales head coach Sean Lynn said: \"One thing which Ireland will bring is that energy and work rate, but we can bring that too. \n\"That's something that I'm asking these players, 'let's match their energy, let's match their work rate and physicality' and then it could be a tight game.\n\"Aoife Wafer has been outstanding [for Ireland], she's a big ball carrier and Dannah O'Brien puts them in positions with her territorial game, they are the two big players and ones we will be looking at. \n\"I definitely have [seen improvements]. The big thing for me is collision dominance, attack and defence, and getting better at it.\n\"Second half against France, we're making line-breaks, but to be in this championship and be a better team we have to be capitalising on these line-breaks.\n\"For me Carys Cox has been a standout ball carrier in our backline and we're really excited.\"\nIreland head coach Scott Bemand said: \"I live fairly close and grew up next to Wales and I understand what it's like to play in Wales. It's an unbelievable experience. They are passionate about their rugby.\n\"We've said we want to go after winning games away from home because that's going to be a massive part of a World Cup.\n\"Backing the Italy piece up this week and taking the green wave over there is going to be a massive for us.\n\"Playing away from home you've got the noise, the atmosphere, the occasion and we've got to learn to deal with it and get excited by it.\n\"We're still a young group, I've seen nothing in the eyes but good energy to get over there and get the job done, but we know it's not going to be easy, it's going to come with challenges and we're fully ready for that.\"\nBemand says Ireland will regroup from King blow\nIreland's King to miss rest of Six Nations and World Cup\nGareth Rhys Owen said: \"It seems strange to think that Wales travelled to Cork 12 months ago buoyed by a sense of optimism.\n\"The expectation was that they'd win, very few predicted a handsome Irish victory. \n\"That result was a reality check for the game in Wales. A new coach has brought fresh enthusiasm and until this game, little in terms of pressure. \n\"The red roses and France were a freebie - but having lost to Scotland - the next two matches come with a little bit of extra pressure. \n\"A win for Ireland will give them hope of finishing the best of the rest.\"\nIreland have won 10 of their last 13 Six Nations matches against Wales, however that includes a run of seven straight victories between 2012 and 2018. Honours are even across the last six clashes, with both sides winning three apiece.\nWales have conceded the fewest penalties of any team (25). However, they have received the most cards of any side (2 yellows, 1 red), while no nation has been awarded more penalties than Ireland (31).\nIreland beat Italy 54-12 in their last away match, ending a run of seven straight losses on the road, during which they conceded an average of 47 points and seven tries per game.\nIreland's Neve Jones and Wales' Abbie Fleming have each made three turnover-winning tackles in this year's championship -- no one has made more.

      "summary": "A pilot project will test whether it is a useful way of fighting climate change.",
      "content": "A ground-breaking project to suck carbon out of the sea has started operating on England's south coast.\nThe small pilot scheme, known as SeaCURE, is funded by the UK government as part of its search for technologies that fight climate change.\nThere's broad consensus among climate scientists that the overwhelming priority is to cut greenhouse gas emissions, the chief cause of global warming.\nBut many scientists also believe that part of the solution will have to involve capturing some of the gases that have already been released. \n These projects, known as carbon capture, usually focus either on capturing emissions at source or pulling them from the air.\nWhat makes SeaCure interesting is that it is testing whether it might be more efficient to pull planet-warming carbon from the sea, since it is present in greater concentrations in water than in the air.\nTo reach the project's entrance you have to go round the back of the Weymouth Sealife Centre and walk past a sign that says \"Caution: Moray Eels may Bite\".\nThere's a reason this ground-breaking project has been placed here.\nIt's a pipe that snakes under the stony beach and out into the English Channel, sucking up seawater and bringing it onshore.\nThe project is trying to find whether removing carbon from the water might be a cost effective way of reducing the amount of the climate warming gas CO2 in the atmosphere.\nSeaCURE processes the seawater to remove the carbon before pumping it back out to sea where it absorbs more CO2. \n We're the first broadcast journalists to visit and Professor Tom Bell from Plymouth Marine Laboratory is tasked with showing us around.\nHe explains that the process begins by treating some of the seawater to make it more acidic. This encourages the carbon that's dissolved in the seawater to turn into a gas and be released into the atmosphere as CO2.\n\"This is the seawater stripper\" Prof Bell says with a smile as we turn a corner.\nThe \"stripper\" is a large stainless steel tank which maximises the amount of contact between the acidic seawater and the air.\n\"When you open a fizzy drink it froths, that's the CO2 coming out.\" Prof Bell says. \"What we're doing by spreading the seawater on a large surface area. It's a bit like pouring a drink on the floor and allowing the CO2 to come out of the seawater really quickly.\"\nThe CO2 that emerges into the air is sucked away and then concentrated using charred coconut husks ready to be stored.\nThe low-carbon seawater then has alkali added to it - to neutralise the acid that was added - and is then pumped back out into a stream that flows into the sea.\nOnce back in the sea it immediately starts to absorb more CO2 from the atmosphere contributing in a very small way to reducing greenhouse gases.\nThere are already much more developed carbon capture technologies which take carbon directly out of the air - but Dr Paul Halloran who leads the SeaCURE project tells me that using water instead has its advantages.\n\"Seawater has got loads of carbon in it compared to the air, about 150 times more,\" says Dr Halloran.\n\"But it has got different challenges, the energy requirements to generate the products that we require to do this from seawater are huge.\"\nAt present the amount of CO2 this pilot project is removing is tiny - at most 100 metric tonnes per year - that's less CO2 than a commercial plane emits crossing the Atlantic. But given the size of the world's oceans those behind SeaCURE think it has potential.\nIn its submission to the UK government SeaCURE said the technology had the potential to be massively scaled up to remove 14 billion tonnes of CO2 a year if 1% of the world's seawater on the ocean's surface was processed.\nFor that to be plausible the entire process for stripping the carbon - would have to be powered by renewable energy. Possibly by solar panels in a floating installation at sea.\n\"Carbon removal is necessary. If you want to reach net zero emissions and net zero emissions is needed to halt further warming,\" says Dr Oliver Geden who's part of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and an expert in carbon capture.\n\"Capturing directly from seawater is one of the options. Directly capturing it from the air is another one. There are basically 15 to 20 options, and in the end the question of what to use, of course, will depend on the cost.\"\nThe Seacure project has PS3m of funding from the government and is one of 15 pilot projects being backed in the UK as part of efforts to develop technologies that capture and store greenhouse gases.\n\"Removing greenhouse gases from the atmosphere is essential in helping us achieve net zero,\" says energy minister Kerry McCarthy. \"Innovative projects like SeaCURE at the University of Exeter play an important role in creating the green technologies needed to make this happen, while supporting skilled jobs and boosting growth.\"\nThere's also the question of what a large quantity of low-carbon water would do to the sea and the things that live in it. In Weymouth it dribbles out of a pipe in such small quantities it is unlikely to have any impact.\nGuy Hooper is a PhD student at Exeter University and is researching the possible impacts of the project. He's been exposing marine creatures to low-carbon water under laboratory conditions.\n\"Marine organisms rely on carbon to do certain things,\" he says. \"So phytoplankton use carbon to photosynthesize while things like mussels also use carbon to build their shells.\"\nHooper says early indications are that massively increasing the amount of low-carbon water could have some impact on the environment.\n\"It might be damaging but there might be ways to mitigate that - for example through pre-diluting the low-carbon water. It's important this is included in the discussion early on.\"\nThese 'gnarly swamp monsters' are breathing life into Florida's Everglades\nAn environmental permit allowing work to stabilise a bridge to start is issued.\nNI's last full-time bee inspector retired in 2024 and the part-time inspector died shortly after.\nRice is a staple food for billions of people around the planet, but a new study suggests climate change may increase arsenic levels contained within the grain.\nA report says the older-style lighting uses up to 80% more electricity than modern LEDs.\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

The project's success will depend on its ability to mitigate any potential environmental impact, which is being researched by PhD student Guy Hooper.  SeaCURE is part of a larger effort in the UK to develop carbon capture technologies and contribute to achieving net zero emissions. \n"

But it was best practice\".\nFor the next two years his hives were checked regularly by the bee inspector for further signs of disease.\nIn a statement, the Democratic Unionist Party's (DUP) Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs spokesperson Carla Lockhart said: \"The beekeeping community has been raising alarm bells for months, and I've personally challenged the minister on this issue several times.\"\n\"Beekeepers deserve better. Our farming sector deserves better. And our environment demands better,\" she said. \n\"I will continue pressing the minister until we see meaningful action, proper accountability, and a full restoration of inspection services.\"\nIn a statement, Daera said it recently met the UBKA, adding that it is \"committed to ensuring that its statutory obligations are fulfilled, which in the case of bee health is primarily to respond to confirmed findings of a notifiable pest or disease in honeybees\".\n\"In addition, the department provides funding to the Agri-Food and Biosciences Institute (AFBI) to provide research and free testing for bee disease, available to support all beekeepers to maintain bee health in Northern Ireland,\" Daera said.\nThese 'gnarly swamp monsters' are breathing life into Florida's Everglades\nAn environmental permit allowing work to stabilise a bridge to start is issued.\nRice is a staple food for billions of people around the planet, but a new study suggests climate change may increase arsenic levels contained within the grain.\nMerville Gardens Village is lined with cherry blossom trees and NI Japanese community celebrate the annual spring blooming.\nA pilot project will test whether it is a useful way of fighting climate change. \nCopyright 2025 BBC.

That was Rory's [16th] Masters, this is my 19th Crucible. One tournament away from completing the Triple Crown for me, the Grand Slam for him,\" reflected Allen.\n\"I watched every single shot on Sunday [of the Masters final round], I was glued to it, the ups, the downs, the drama.

The Japanese community celebrates their 'Hanami' festival by visiting the trees to reflect, eat, dance, and honor the transient beauty of cherry blossoms, which symbolize the fleeting nature of life in Japan. Yukari Norris and Yoriko Marshall, members of the Japan Society NI's dance group, wore traditional kimonos during their visit, highlighting the significance of the cherry blossom as a cultural symbol.  The trees are especially cherished by those who have moved to Northern Ireland from Japan, serving as a reminder of home and a way to connect with their heritage.

      "content": "Most fire services in England are facing a shortfall in funding after the government failed to give them the same level of compensation for tax increases as the police.\nThe government is giving police forces an extra PS230m which it says will fully cover the cost of the rise in employers' National Insurance contributions (Nics) which came into force last week.\nFire services face a similar rise in their wages bill - but the 31 that are directly funded by the government will only get top-up funds that cover 50% of the increase on average, according to BBC research.\nOne fire service said the 50% shortfall was the same cost as \"a fully-staffed fire engine\".\nA spokesperson for the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government (MHCLG) declined to comment on the discrepancy but did thank firefighters for their \"dedication\".\nThe government faced a backlash from business and charities after Chancellor Rachel Reeves used her first Budget to increase Nics made by employers from 13.8% to 15%.\nThe Treasury says it will cover the extra costs faced by government departments and public sector employers.\nIn February, the then minister for policing, Dame Diana Johnson, told MPs the national insurance increases would be \"fully funded\" in the police settlement - the annual funding agreement for forces in England and Wales.\nThe government also provided PS502m in top-up funds for fire authorities and councils in their annual settlement grant to cover Nics rises.\nBut the National Fire Chiefs Council says that even with the extra money fire services will be PS20m short of the PS40m needed to cover national insurance increases.\nThe BBC contacted all 43 fire authority in England to ask how much the NICs increase is set to cost and cross-referenced that with the size of the grant they are getting to compensate for it.\nThe data obtained shows the average shortfall to be 50%.\nIt covers three quarters of the fire services in England and Wales, because 10 fire authorities do not separate out grant money from the money given to the whole county council.\nBut the Home Office's own estimate is that the cost of the Nics rise to all fire authorities is PS40m, which also lends weight to the fire chiefs' claims of a 50% shortfall.\nNFCC chair Phil Garrigan said: \"Bridging this gap in funding and making sure there is sustained investment in fire and rescue will be crucial for ensuring we can continue to keep communities safe.\n\"What we would have reasonably expected to see is fire treated in the same way as our colleagues in the police, with the whole shortfall covered.\"\nFire Brigades Union general secretary Steve Wright said fire services had already had more than a decade of cuts and the Nics shortfall was coming on top of \" yet another below inflation funding settlement\".\n\"If national insurance contributions are not covered fully by central funds, this will further eat into fire service budgets,\" he said.\n\"When compared to the police, the cost of covering the rise in national insurance contributions for the fire service is very small, so we urge the government to do the right thing and to avoid another de-facto cut.\"\nFunding for fire services is complex because there are several different types of fire authority split into two funding models - but nearly three-quarters of fire authorities have received direct grants from the government, worth PS11.9m overall.\nThose direct grants were provided to 31 fire authorities - five authorities run by metro mayors and 26 combined fire authorities (CFAs), five of which have Police, Fire and Crime Commissioners (PFCCs).\nThe biggest shortfall was 67% in West Yorkshire, followed by 60% in Humberside, and the smallest was 17% in Essex, followed by 32% in Cumbria.\nThere are 10 more fire authorities where a county council runs the fire service, and Nics grants for the fire service were mixed in with the Nics top-ups for council staff, making the total for just the fire service difficult to untangle.\nLondon and Greater Manchester also have their own structures, where the mayor has overall responsibility for Fire and Rescue services, and funding is again not separated out from Nics grants for council staff.\nBudget papers from Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Services confirmed estimates suggested they could see a 50% shortfall in funding, which \"would equate to the cost of one fully-staffed fire engine\".\nA spokesman for Greater London Fire and Rescue Service said the mayor of London had provided an additional PS2.5m top-up funding to cover the PS4.4m (36%) shortfall left by the government grant.\nSign up for our Politics Essential newsletter to read top political analysis, gain insight from across the UK and stay up to speed with the big moments.

      "ml_hf_summary": "England's fire services are facing a funding shortfall due to increased National Insurance contributions (Nics) for employers, which will cost them £40 million. While the government allocated £502 million in top-up funds to cover Nics increases for fire authorities, they will still face a 50% average shortfall, equivalent to the cost of a fully-staffed fire engine. This discrepancy stems from the government's decision to provide police forces with full funding for their Nics increase, while fire services are only receiving partial compensation. The National Fire Chiefs Council argues that this disparity is unfair and requires equal funding treatment for both police and fire services.  The shortfall in funding will impact fire service operations and potentially lead to further cuts if not addressed. \n"

      "summary": "Smaller parties are looking to cause an upset in mayoral contests in Hull and the West of England.",
      "content": "Voters appear to be in a restless mood as Labour faces its first electoral test since its landslide general election victory.\nReform UK is surging in the polls and the Liberal Democrats and Greens are also seeking to capitalise on voters' apparent disenchantment with Labour and the Conservatives in English local elections.\nBut can they turn their poll ratings into real power on 1 May? We tested the waters in two mayoral contests in very different parts of the country.\nIn the spring sun the mood in Hull does not scream political drama.\nFamilies out in busy shops and cafes, a salty breeze from the Humber cutting through the heat rising from the cobblestones.\nBut beneath the calm, the race to become the first mayor of Hull and East Yorkshire combined authority is on a knife's edge.\nAnd the result is likely to tell us a lot about the febrile and fractured state of British politics in 2025.\nThe political map of the Hull and East Yorkshire Combined Authority (Heyca) is a patchwork, covering around 600,000 people on the north side of the Humber estuary.\nLabour dominates in the city - with all three of its MPs - but the council has been run by the Lib Dems for the past three years. \nThe Conservatives remain strong in the market towns and villages of the East Riding of Yorkshire - returning all the areas MPs and making up the largest group on the council.\nConservative leader Kemi Badenoch has warned the party of \"extremely difficult\" local elections, but local Tory candidate Anne Handley is confident.\nHandley, who leads East Riding of Yorkshire Council under minority rule, admits the Conservatives \"have had a bad press\" after a record defeat in the general election last year. \n\"But people are looking at the person rather than the politics in this,\" she argues.\nThe seat is also a major target for Reform UK. It has selected local golden-boy Luke Campbell, Olympic champion bantamweight boxer at London 2012, as its candidate.\nAs a self-styled political outsider born-and-bred in Hull, Campbell says he can \"bridge the gap\" between government and an area that's \"being ignored\".\nCampbell says he hopes to echo some of Donald Trump's success in the US, capitalising on a strong sense of voter disillusionment in the area.\n\"We need to make Britain great again,\" he says.\nLocal artist Nelly Richards says he believes Reform could take the mayoralty.\nMr Richards, who owns a shop on Hull's main shopping parade framed by empty units, says people want to \"send a message\" to the major parties.\nPut off by Labour's record in government, life-long Labour voters Jill Cook and Jane O'Neil from Hessle say they may vote Reform for the first time.\nMrs O'Neil says she has been hit by the Winter Fuel Payment cuts and Labour rejecting any compensation for women hit by changes to the state pension age.\n\"I keep thinking, we haven't got enough money to do everything for everybody,\" Mrs O'Neil said, adding that \"maybe we need to pull up the drawbridge, even if just for a little bit\".\nThere is a definite sense of an \"anyone but Reform\" vote mobilising as well.\nKeith Whiles, a 78-year-old retiree, sums up the sentiment of many: \"Luke Campbell - what does he know about politics?\"\nThe lifelong Labour voter says he will use his vote to get \"someone who's a bit more experienced\" into office.\nHull was once rock-solid Labour territory - and their candidate Margaret Pinder would have been the natural home for voters looking to block Reform. \nBut after less than a year in government, Labour's grip is loosening.\nAlfie Appleton, who owns Hull's independent clothing shop the Chinese Laundry said \"Labour aren't my best friends at the moment\".\nHe is politically homeless after his natural party Labour \"kicked us in the teeth with the budget this year\" by raising National Insurance contributions while, cutting small business rate relief and raising minimum wages.\nMike Ross, the Liberal Democrat leader of Hull City Council and candidate for mayor believes his party is best placed to scoop up votes.\n\"There's a lot more people who are against Reform than pro. \n\"Given how well we do across the patch in the local elections, we are probably the best placed party to stop Reform winning.\"\nThe new mayor was established under the previous Tory administration in 2023 to push powers out of Westminster, copying the blueprint of London Mayor Sadiq Khan and Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham.\nLabour plan to expand the programme to every English region to simplify local government and boost economic growth.\nThe Heyca mayor will be given a PS13.3m a year budget, with key responsibilities to oversee local transport and growth plans.\nRowan Halstead says his party, the Yorkshire Party, are the only group \"not shackled\" by national allegiances so would put this money and people in the region first.\nWhoever becomes mayor will have big economic challenges to tackle. Hull is one of the most economically deprived areas in England. \nEast Riding has one of the fastest growing economies in the country, but Analysis by the Institute for Government has found the productivity across the whole region still remains below the national average.\nA 150 miles away, in the West of England region, the political terrain looks different but just as volatile.\nLabour make up the majority of local MPs. But the party is reeling from rape and child abuse allegations against incumbent Dan Norris - who was elected as a Labour candidate but has been expelled from the party while police investigate.\nEven before news of Norris' arrest broke, Labour's candidate Helen Godwin was pitching herself as a clean break from a previous regime that put West of England Combined Authority (Weca) in special measures due to infighting.\nGodwin, a Bristol City councillor, told the BBC: \"I would be operating an authority that is inclusive, lots of discussion and room for disagreement - but actually getting the hard work done.\"\nDespite some \"tough decisions\", Godwin says she does not see \"a great shift away from Labour\" since last July's election.\nThe Liberal Democrats and Greens both sent MPs to parliament from constituencies in the area. Lib Dem Oli Henman and Green Party candidate Mary Page see themselves as the closest challengers to Labour.\nIn 2021, Page stood to be the Lib Dem candidate for Mayor of Bristol - a role she later campaigned to abolish - before joining the Greens in 2023. \nShe argues her shift to the Greens reflects a journey many voters have been on.\n\"I'm having people telling me all the time 'I was a Labour supporter but now I'm joining the Greens',\" she said. \"Not just voting but actively saying they're joining.\"\nOne of these is new mother Pheobe Bracewell, who says she wants \"to see more focus on sustainability of the planet\".\nArron Banks - famed for his PS1m pound donation to Nigel Farage's UKIP and his prominent role in the 2016 Brexit referendum - has attracted attention with his decision to stand for Reform UK.\nIndependent councillor Ian Scott has, meanwhile, told the BBC there is \"an appetite\" in the independent-minded West of England for someone outside the party system.\nThe west of England is the most productive region outside London, according to Weca's own analysis.\nBut while the economy looks good on paper, workers in the area contend with wages that have flatlined over the last 15 years while house prices increased to ten times average earnings.\nPlans for trams and underground trains in Bristol - one of the largest cities in Europe not to have a mass transit system - fell apart last year amid political bickering.\nAnger over slow buses and gridlocked roads is palpable when you talk to voters.\n\"The bus service is awful and the price of this is exorbitant,\" NHS traffic marshal Craig Wimblin says.\nWhile he supports Reform, he plans to use his vote to oust the Green Party, who he blames for clogging the streets through a low traffic scheme in the east of the city.\nThe Greens now face blowback from the voters over choices made by their councillors, the biggest group on Bristol City Council - including dropped plans to collect black waste bins every four weeks.\nPolitical disengagement is another major factor in this election. The main response to questions about the mayoral race was a shrug of the shoulders.\nTurnout for the last Weca mayor was 36% and not expected to improve this time given there are no other local elections in the area this year.\nCouncil election in Hull last year saw a turnout of just 21%.\nElection experts Prof Colin Rallings and Prof Michael Thrasher argue low turnout is creating a chaotic political landscape - potentially handing power to small but driven groups of voters.\nThe results of these contests could ripple beyond mayors actual powers over local transport or training budgets. \nThe mayoralty will give the winners a platform, visibility and momentum to shape the political debate in the years before the next general election\nThese races could be an up-close look at where national politics goes next.\nOur round-up of pictures this week includes sunrises, wildlife and craft enthusiasts.\nThe organisation began as a Facebook group to redistribute old clothing seven years ago.\nFrank Morris's sketches can take him anywhere between five and 10 hours to complete. \nFilton Leisure Centre closed suddenly on 3 April after its previous operator went bust.\nThe railway, originally planned for Easter, will now open in July.\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

He loves maths and physics - something his sisters find hard to understand.\nHe's sitting A-levels this summer, before taking a year out to decide between an apprenticeship or university.\nHe and older sister Emma both say that doing past papers and applying their revision to the questions has really helped with their study in the past. \n\"If I'm not doing questions to apply it, it just doesn't go in,\" Ben says.\nBut what works for one student may not work for others, and expert Stevie suggests that thinking creatively about how your child can revise is a good idea - think flashcards, mind maps or even YouTube videos.\n\"I love flash cards - they're so easy and quick,\" says youngest daughter Jess.\n\"It also means we can get involved as well,\" adds dad Steve, explaining that parents can help to test their children on them.\nWhen we're stressed, it can be tempting to push aside time for fun and relaxation - but it's actually really important in helping us to perform well in exams, Stevie says.\n\"We really need to look after our brains. It's really important to get the balance.\"\nFor Emma, reading or walks with her mum, dad and their dog Maisie was important time to carve out during A-levels.\nIt's basketball for Jess, who is worried that her current knee injury means she won't be able to play to relax during her GCSE exams.\n\"Now I just come home and nap,\" she says.\nShe says she's feeling the pressure with her GCSE grades, as not only does she need them for basketball college here, but her dreams of basketball college in the US for university afterwards rely on them too.\nTheir brother Ben enjoys playing on his Xbox with friends, but says he drags himself back downstairs to do work when he realises he has been ignoring his revision a little too long.\nAs a lot of exams rely on memory, expert Stevie says that staying hydrated, eating healthily, exercising, and having time to do the things we love can help us look after our brains.\nTime with your favourite TV show or even a scroll through TikTok can also help to find that balance.\nYou can't have too much of a good thing.\nPhones can help us to stay connected to friends and family during tough times, but they can also be distracting.\n\"I have to hide my phone underneath books or behind my laptop,\" says Emma. \"If I see it, I'll just go on it.\"\nWhen asked how she will avoid the distraction of her phone during her GCSE exams, younger sister Jess says she \"hasn't worked that one out yet\".\nDad Steve has offered to take it away - if Jess wants him to - in order to help her focus.\n\"I don't think anyone is going to learn if they're being forced to sit in a room with someone standing over them, or with the threat of: 'We're going to take your phone away,'\" he says. \n\"It's tricky.\"\nSometimes it can be tempting to say to people: \"Don't worry, it'll be fine.\" \nBut that can invalidate their feelings, says expert Stevie.\n\"We're all guilty of saying it and it comes often from a very good place,\" she says.\n\"But for that young person there is a very valid worry there.\"\nInstead, she suggests acknowledging the worry, and saying something like: \"I can absolutely hear that you are worried, and it's completely natural in exams, but you've put so much time and energy into revision.\n\"You've worked so hard and whatever happens, we'll be here to support you.\"\n\"I think when things are getting tough, just step away from it,\" says teacher and dad Steve.\n\"Staying healthy - mentally healthy and physically healthy - has to be the most important thing.\"\nWhen tensions are high at home around revision and exams, arguments may happen. Stevie from Young Minds says that walking away and having a cooling off period is essential.\n\"Once people have cooled down, you can reflect, say that you understand why they are feeling so frustrated, and ask if there's anything you can do to support them.\"\n\"I think something we'd definitely say as teachers is that it's not a good idea to come out of an exam and stand in a big group of people and hear what everyone else wrote,\" says Steve.\nAnd his daughter Emma agrees.\n\"I just walked out by myself, got my bag and went home,\" she says. \"I was like, 'I'm not ruining this, goodbye!'\"\n\"It's just a great feeling of relief after you've done the exam,\" adds Ben.\nWith exams around the corner, the Jolleys are also keeping an eye on what they have to look forward to after it's all finished.\nTrips to Malta, Croatia and Magaluf are on the horizon, as well as a school prom. \nThey just need to get through those exams first.\nListen to Radio 5 Live's Revision Time Special with Nicky Campbell from 10:00 on Friday, 18 April on BBC Sounds, with tips on how to keep calm when revising.

      "summary": "The festival returns for a second weekend in the Californian desert. Here's how to watch at home.",
      "content": "The best thing about Coachella is that it happens twice - so if you missed the first weekend, don't worry! \nLady Gaga, Travis Scott, Charli XCX and everyone else will return to the Colorado Desert on Friday for a second dose of musical mayhem, and punishing gusts of wind.\nBetter yet, the opening weekend let us know who was worth watching (Lady Gaga), who we can safely avoid (Travis Scott) and who might be this year's breakout star (Benson Boone).\nWith that in mind, here's a guide to this weekend's sets - and when you can watch them on Coachella's comprehensive YouTube livestream.\nLady Gaga's elaborate stage performances have been known to collapse under the weight of their own ambition. Not this time.\nHer second visit to Coachella, after stepping in as a last-minute replacement for Beyonce in 2017, was one of the greatest pop performances ever. Two hours full of energy and presence and pounding synth hooks.\nStaged in a crumbling gothic opera house, the two-hour show depicted the star's inner angels and demons wrestling for her soul.\nDuring Poker Face, the two sides faced off in a deadly game of chess; while Perfect Celebrity - a song about her tabloid commodification in the 2000s - saw her buried in a shallow grave, singing to a skeleton.\nIt was bold and audacious and over the top, in all the best ways, with celebratory, nine-minute performance of Bad Romance to cap it all off. \nIf you only watch one performance, make it this one.\nWatch on the Coachella Stage at 11:10pm on Friday (local time), or 7:10am on Saturday (UK time).\nDespite a career that's lasted three decades, Missy Elliot only staged her first ever tour last year. \nLuckily, tracks like Get Ur Freak On, Lose Control and Pass That Dutch still sound as fresh and futuristic now as they did first time around - and Missy's relative lack of stage experience was never apparent.\nShe arrived onstage inside a giant car exo-skeleton, like a hip-hop Transformer, and sped through her set with pin-sharp choreography and boundless good humour.\nThe only downside was that her set had to end after just 55 minutes.\nWatch on the Coachella Stage at 9:00pm on Friday (local time), or 5:00am on Saturday (UK time). \n \"I'm either going to faint or throw up,\" declared Lola Young near the start of her set last weekend. \"One of the two is about to happen\".\nThe British singer, whose song Messy has been embraced by fans worldwide, was battling sickness and heatstroke throughout her set. But she powered through, leading a mass singalong to Messy, and debuting a new single called Spiders.\nWith her health back on track, her second weekend performance should erase any bad memories from her debut.\nWatch on the Mojave Stage at 4:50pm on Friday (local time), or 12:50am on Saturday (UK time).\nAlthough Travis Scott closed the main stage on Saturday, Green Day were technically the headliners - and the California band delivered a thrilling, cathartic set worthy of their billing.\nThey plunged head-first into a furious rendition of American Idiot, keeping up their recent tradition of changing the lyrics, so that frontman Billie Joe Armstrong sang: \"I'm not part of the MAGA agenda\".\nThat aside, politics were kept to a minimum, as the group delivered a high-voltage blast of their greatest hits, from the bratty pop-punk of Basket Case to the more reflective Boulevard of Broken Dreams.\nWatch on the Coachella Stage at 9:05pm on Saturday (local time), or 5:05am on Sunday (UK time).\n\"Post-ee, Post-ee, Post-ee.\"\nIt might have been the end of the weekend, but fans still had energy to spare for Post Malone's headline slot on Sunday night.\nHe rewarded them with a laid-back set, that repurposed some of his earlier pop/rap hits with the \"yee-haw\" twang of his recent album F-1 Trillion.\nIt all worked surprisingly well, although the eight-piece band occasionally overpowered his voice, and some fans were disappointed by the lack of hip-hop beats - saying the show would have been better suited to Coachella's sister festival Stagecoach (which is where Post launched his country phase last year).\nSurprisingly, the set was devoid of special guests, leading to speculation that the 29-year-old was holding fire for weekend two. \nAs someone who's recently collaborated with Taylor Swift, Beyonce and Dolly Parton, that could definitely be worth staying up for.\nWatch on the Coachella Stage at 10:25pm on Sunday (local time), or 6:25am on Monday (UK time).\nIn 2019, Blackpink made history by becoming the first Korean group to headline Coachella. This year, two of its members - Lisa and Jennie - were back with dazzling solo sets, before the band reconvenes for a stadium tour in the summer.\nLisa was up first, on Friday night, with a slick, highly-choreographed set that combined hard-edged rap cuts like Money and Lifestyle, with the softer sounds of Moonlit Floor and Dream.\nAfter her appearance in the third series of The White Lotus, she clarified that music is, in fact, her main job. Backstage, she held a post-mortem on the performance with her bandmate Rose (Conclusion: The desert wind makes it hard to sing).\nJennie packed the Outdoor Theater on Sunday evening, for a set of clubby disco anthems that don't sound a million miles away from her friend and collaborator Dua Lipa.\nHighlights included the bombastic Like Jennie - produced by Diplo, and boasting it's own viral dance break - and the swoonsome pop of Love Hangover, which showcased her vocal abilities.\nThe 29-year-old has never been the most precise performer, but it somehow works to her advantage - making her more \"real\" than the imperious perfection of her peers. \nWatch Lisa on the Sahara Stage at 7:45pm on Friday (local time), or 3:45am on Saturday (UK time). Jennie plays the Outdoor Theatre at 7:45pm on Sunday (local time), or 3:45am on Monday (UK time).\nCharli XCX drew one of the weekend's biggest crowds, for a sleazy, hedonistic run-through of her sleazy, hedonistic breakout album, Brat.\nPerforming entirely on her own, the star was in constant motion - a mesmerising blur of hip-rolls, hair tosses, stomach crunches and knee-drops, as she turned Coachella's main stage into sweat-drenched, laser-lit club night.\nCompared to the maximalism of other sets, it was a lesson in how one person can hold a stage on their own... Well, almost.\nAt several points, she brought out her collaborators from Brat's companion album - Troye Sivan, Billie Eilish and Lorde. It was, one excitable fan commented, \"like The Avengers for gay people\".\nWhether the guest-list will be the same on Coachella's second weekend remains to be seen. But Charli is worth your time either way.\nWatch on the Coachella Stage at 7:15pm on Saturday (local time), or 3:15am on Sunday (UK time).\nAnyone who's had the pleasure of watching Benson Boone over the last year will know he's fond of performing a front flip off his piano, the big show off.\nHe didn't let us down at Coachella - bouncing around the stage like a Duracell Bunny attached to a car battery. To cap it all off, he brought out Brian May for a surprisingly successful version of Bohemian Rhapsody.\nLess fortunate, however, was Texan singer d4vd, whose attempt at a backflip went disastrously wrong.\nThankfully, he recovered in time to pull off an energetic set that highlighted the life-affirming vibes of his bedroom pop hits Feel It and What Are You Waiting For.\nAfter the set, he swore to practice harder for this weekend's performance. \"Imagine if I fall again,\" he cringed.\nWatch Benson Boone on the Coachella Stage at 7:05pm on Friday (local time), or 3:45 am on Saturday (UK Time). D4vd plays the Gobi Stage at 5:55pm on Friday (local time), or 1:55am on Saturday (UK time).\nLast Saturday, the entire LA Philharmonic Orchestra boarded a bus and set off for the desert to make their Coachella debut.\nUnder the baton of Venezuelan conductor Gustavo Dudamel, they performed what was billed as \"Gustavo's mixtape\" - moving seamlessly between classical standards like Wagner's Ride of the Valkyries and Beethoven's Fifth Symphony, and modern pop hits.\nFor the latter, they were joined on stage by a host of A-list stars, including indie titan Beck, Icelandic songstress Laufey, country singer Maren Morris and rap icon LL Cool J.\n\"I told to the orchestra, 'I'm so happy conducting, but I wish I could be in the middle of the crowd and enjoy the moment,'\" Dudamel told Variety magazine ahead of the show.\nWeekend two will feature an all-new array of guest stars, he promised, but details are being kept under wraps for now. \nThe LA Philharmonic plays the Outdoor Theatre at 6:25pm on Saturday (local time), or 2:25am on Sunday (UK time).\n\"It took me 20 years to get on this stage,\" said T-Pain towards the end of his set on Saturday, and he certainly made the most of his hour-long set.\nHe covered Journey's Don't Stop Believin' and Chris Stapleton's country hit Tennessee Whiskey, while racing through early 2000s hits like Buy U A Drank and I'm In Luv, and revisiting his verses on Flo Rida's Low, and Kanye West's Good Life.\nFor that, he received a hero's welcome, with the crowd treating his set as an excuse for some turn of the millennium escapism. \nBy the time it ended, a campaign had started for T-Pain to play next year's Super Bowl half-time show.\nWatch on the Coachella Stage at 5:25pm on Saturday (local time), or 1:25am on Sunday (UK time).\nLuckily, you're not forced to stay up all night to watch the stars strut their stuff in California.\nCoachella's generous livestreams repeat throughout the day, and you can rewind several hours to find the performances you want.\nOther highlights from the first weekend included Megan Thee Stallion, whose star-studded set included appearances from Queen Latifah, Victoria Monet, and Ciara; and Kraftwerk, reminding everyone that they essentially invented electronic music.\nBelinda Carlisle reunited with her old band The Go-Gos for a dose of sun-kissed 1980s nostalgia, and the UK's Sam Fender tore through a blistering set that showcased the songwriting chops of his new album, People Watching.\nAmong the newcomers with main stage aspirations were South Africa's hip-swivelling R&B star Tyla, and New York dance act Fcukers, whose breakout hit Bon Bon was one of the weekend's most inescapable tracks.\nYou can see the full line-up for Coachella's second weekend on the festival's website.\nMemories are being sought of the heady early days of rave.\nThe singer describes the troubled gestation of her third album, as she launches it on the West End.\nThe new Disney project, titled Star Wars: Starfighter, is set to be released in May 2027.\nThe singer says he feels there is an \"unspoken law\" that celebrities should always be accessible.\nJonny Fox is displaying his paintings at an exhibition called Back Story in Seaford, East Sussex. \nCopyright 2025 BBC.

      "published": "2025-04-18",
      "summary": "Portraying some of the most famous people on the planet has its challenges, experts say.",
      "content": "Playing any well-known figure from recent history is a challenge, but the challenge of finding four actors to put in convincing portrayals of four of the most famous people in popular culture is one not many directors have attempted. \nEarlier this month, director Sam Mendes announced the cast for his four-part Beatles biopic, with each member of the band set to be the subject of their own feature-length films set for release in 2028.\nActors Harris Dickinson, Paul Mescal, Joseph Quinn and Barry Keoghan will play John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr respectively.\nTheir performances - and particularly their efforts at the Beatles' distinctive accents - will be closely watched by fans the world over. And if previous actors' attempts are anything to go by, they should brace themselves for some serious scrutiny.\nPerhaps one of the most famous and successful Beatles biopics is 1994's Backbeat, set in the band's 1960-1962 Hamburg era. \nOn the one hand, it had Liverpool actor Ian Hart turning in a convincing Lennon (even if he was not exactly Lennon's double). \nBut on the other, Hollywood actor Stephen Dorff, playing the film's lead character of original Beatles bass player and artist Stuart Sutcliffe, who died of a brain haemorrhage aged just 21, provided an uncanny likeness. But his attempt at the Liverpool accent has received, over the years since, reviews from \"decent\" to \"variable\" to \"awful\".\nSo should any actor taking on a Beatle role be wary?\nBeatles historian Paul Du Noyer, who wrote The Beatles: The Complete Illustrated Story and Conversations With Paul McCartney, said: \"The Beatles are so well known to us all, not just their faces but every nuance of the way they talk, every mannerism. \n\"Many of us know the Beatles as well as we know our own families. It can be difficult for us to suspend the disbelief. \n\"Even when I've seen performances that were very good, for example Ian Hart in Backbeat, that got around the problem of the familiarity by dwelling on a lesser-known period of their story.\"\nDu Noyer added that some Beatles might seem easier to take off than others.\n\"In some ways, you stick a wig and a beard on someone, little round granny glasses and a white suit and everyone goes, 'It's John Lennon'\"\nBut he said McCartney was a tougher portrayal to nail - especially when the man himself is a tough critic.\n\"Paul has been very critical of films like [Sam Taylor-Wood's early years biopic of John Lennon] Nowhere Boy, and Backbeat, because they tend to fall into a pastiche of McCartney that he doesn't recognise - he doesn't like the stereotype of him being the cute one, the manipulative one.\"\nSo does Sam Mendes have a job on his hands?\nDu Noyer added: \"He's got bankable stars, who won't let themselves down. I know there's been some disappointment among Liverpudlians because non-Liverpudlians have been cast in the roles, but even as a loyal Liverpudlian I can't condemn Sam Mendes on the casting, because he is making films for the whole world to watch. \n\"I think the accuracy of the Liverpool accent will be pretty low down the list of things he needs to cover.\"\nEdda Sharpe, a Merseyside-based voice and dialect coach who has worked with actors at the Royal Shakespeare Company and the National Theatre, said there were some specific challenges to taking on the voice of a Beatle.\nAmong them is the fact that the accent with which John, Paul, George and Ringo spoke is much less pronounced than the one many might associate with Liverpool today.\nBeatles aficionados will know that on the Let It Be album version of the old Liverpool folk tune Maggie May, Lennon deliberately exaggerated the Liverpool accent, elongating his vowels and adding a much more nasal quality to it. \nThe performance has more in common with today's Scouse accent than it did with the one the Beatles spoke with.\n\"And the challenge is, the way the Beatles spoke, you just don't hear that any more. It's a completely different tone to the Liverpool accent we are currently exposed to,\" Sharpe said.\n\"And you are not just trying to create the sound of someone from Liverpool in the 1960s, you are trying to create the sound of people that everyone is familiar with.\"\nShe said there might be advantages for Irish actors Mescal and Keoghan, as there are certain common traits to both Liverpool and Irish accents.\nBut she said similarities in accent could also prove problematic for actors.\n\"The northern Irish accent, particularly, has this sort of down-and-then-up quality, and when you listen to early recordings of the Beatles you hear what sounds like a familiar Irish pattern.\n\"But sometimes accents that are closer to your own are harder to do than ones that are completely different.\"\nDr Paul Cooper, a senior lecturer in English Language at the University of Liverpool, said there was academic research to back up the idea that \"Scouse was getting more Scouse\" than it used to be in the time of the Beatles.\nHe said research by linguistics expert Marten Juskan into the changing sound of the Scouse accent supported the claim.\n\"Also,\" said Cooper, \"I think younger people are now looking at the accent more favourably than maybe it was looked at 30 or 40 years ago.\n\"There's always been a strong sense of pride in the accent, but I think in the 1980s and 1990s you got the Harry Enfield Scousers stuff and it maybe became viewed a bit more negatively.\n\"I think now it's viewed a bit more favourably again. Plus, Liverpool is much more of a tourist destination now, and the accent is thought of as very welcoming and very friendly.\"\nBut what does an actor who has taken on not one but two Beatle roles think the challenge will be for the actors taking on the Fab Four in Mendes' films? \nMichael Hawkins played John Lennon in the successful stage show Cilla: The Musical based on the life and career of Liverpool entertainer Cilla Black, and, in his first TV role, George Harrison in the 2014 ITV serial biopic Cilla, with Sheridan Smith taking the title role.\nHawkins said: \"You've got to do your research, watch as much stuff as you can. \n\"Obviously in the films like Hard Days Night they're sort of playing a version of themselves, but with the Get Back film, you see more of them as how they were.\n\"So many people feel like they know them so well that if you get something a little off, it'll make people wince.\n\"It's about getting the authenticity, and not doing a caricature.\"\nThe 35-year-old, a member of \"parody band\" Ugly Baby, said even as a born-and-bred Scouser he was not immune from scrutiny for his portrayal of Harrison in Cilla.\nHe added: \"I didn't really change my accent much for playing George. And then one of my mates sent me a review, from the Mirror, I think it was, where they were saying George's accent was just a general northern one, with no hint of the 'Pool.\n\"And I was the only Scouser out of the four of us.\"\nListen to the best of BBC Radio Merseyside on Sounds and follow BBC Merseyside on Facebook, X, and Instagram.

The casting choices include Harris Dickinson, Paul Mescal, Joseph Quinn, and Barry Keoghan. The accuracy of the actors' accents is a key concern, as Beatles fans are well-versed in their distinctive speech patterns. While Ian Hart's performance in \"Backbeat\" (1994) was praised for its authenticity, Stephen Dorff's portrayal in the same film received mixed reviews.  Experts like Paul Du Noyer and Edda Sharpe highlight the challenges of capturing the Beatles' unique vocal styles and the importance of authentic representation.

      "summary": "A top Somali actor is targeted in a revenge killing shortly after making a film warning about such feuds.",
      "content": "\"No man avenged has ever risen from the grave\" is the haunting tagline of a film that has shocked Somalis to the core in a case of life imitating art.\nCalled Aano Qabiil, meaning \"Clan Vengeance\", the short film sought to highlight the futility of vendettas between rival clans that sometimes go back generations and lead to senseless killings - often of young men who are targeted just because of their lineage.\nIt was a poetic warning, a cry - a story intended not just to entertain, but to educate a wounded nation.\nSince its release earlier this month, it has gone viral as people have learnt that one of the actors in the drama was later shot dead in exactly the kind of clan revenge killing the film had warned about.\nGuudey Mohamed Geedi, a veteran of Somali cinema, had played a character who tried to intervene to stop the owner of a teashop from being killed as he hid in a building from gunmen from a rival clan.\nOutside a woman is heard shouting: \"Don't let him leave alive, I want to drink his blood,\" as Geedi's character pleads: \"He's just a tea vendor - what did he do to you that warrants his death?\"\nNot long after the filming of Aano Qabiil wrapped up in the town of Bal'ad, around 30km (18 miles) north-east of the capital, Mogadishu, Geedi travelled to visit his family in the countryside.\nIt is in rural areas that rivalries between Somali clans proliferate. Sometimes the disputes are about long-standing competition for resources such as grazing land or access to wells for camels and other livestock.\nBut even minor issues can sometimes spark a deadly feud - for example a remark by a politician in the capital.\nWhen Geedi reached his small village outside Warsheikh, in the Middle Shabelle region, he did not know that tensions between two Abgal sub-clans were about to boil over.\nThe 45-year-old was shot dead outside his home in November by armed men as part of this long-standing inter-family feud.\nNo-one has been arrested for his murder and the authorities have not commented on the case.\nIt often happens that clan-related killings go un-investigated - especially in rural zones. They are seen as \"private matters\" or too complex to intervene in.\n\"He died in real life the same way as the violence played out in the film,\" his friend Adaawe, who requested that only his first name be used, told the BBC.\n\"Only this time, there was no camera, no director to yell 'cut'. No-one to plead for his life.\"\nAbdisiyaad Abdullhai Mohamed, who wrote and directed Aano Qabiil for Astaan TV, said Geedi had been instrumental during filming.\n\"We worked closely together. Guudey believed in the message we were trying to convey. He wasn't just an actor; he was a key part of the vision I had for the story,\" the 32-year-old told the BBC.\nThe film-maker grew up in a community often affected by stories of bloodshed, where people are killed in the name of seeking justice.\n\"I wanted to show the humanitarian cost that follows simply hearing the news that someone has been killed due to clan revenge,\" he said.\n\"As Somalis, every time we hear someone has been killed, we never stop to think or ask ourselves if that person belonged to a close family that is now destroyed and a future lost.\"\nThe story of the film centres on two friends, Ali and Salah, who belong to rival sub-groups of an unnamed clan.\nTogether they run a teashop in Bal'ad, when clan violence from the countryside intrudes upon their lives. Neither of them knows what has brought the feud to their doorstep.\n\"The same cursed clans we were born into are at war again,\" says Ali, who at first manages to save Salah's life before he himself becomes a target.\nTo avenge Ali's death, Salah is then killed. The film ends with clansmen laughing over his bullet-ridden body near Ali's grave - happy that honour has been satisfied.\n\"In my film, I showed how the death of Ali affects his wife, Sahra, who is pregnant. Overall, this film was a cry for help, meant to raise awareness among the Somali community,\" said the director, Mohamed.\nClan identity is deeply engrained in Somali society. The country has four major clans, and each has hundreds of sub-clans, with even those divided, depending on the region.\nMany Somalis have grown up hearing about the killings of close relatives in the name of past grievances or clan rivalries.\nClan-related killings contribute to internal conflicts and displacement in Somalia, especially in rural areas.\nBut a 2023 report from PeaceRep, a research organisation based in the UK, highlighted the spread of clan revenge killings to cities in central Somalia.\nSomali Peace Line, a local organisation, recorded in its 2022 annual report more than 160 clan-related killings in just one year, most of which went without justice, further fuelling the cycle of violence.\nIn some central regions, up to 80% of clan killings remain unresolved, leading to communities failing to learn from the tragedies.\nMohamed explained that he had met Geedi, who was married with 11 children, through a community casting contact.\n\"From the moment we spoke, I knew he understood the depth of what we were trying to portray,\" he said.\n\"He was a man who truly understood the impact of clan violence, and that's why he was perfect for our message.\"\nThe film-maker is tormented by how a man who raised his voice for peace has become a victim of clan vengeance.\n\"It's painful,\" he said. \"We made this film to warn people, and then, it happens to him. It's hard to accept.\"\nReaction to the film has been splashed all over social media, the mantra \"no man avenged has ever risen from the grave\" has been shared widely across Somali TikTok and Facebook, along with images of Geedi and clips from the film.\nWhen asked what he hoped people would take away from the film, Mohamed said: \"I want people to understand that revenge does not bring resolution - it only leads to more death and destruction.\n\"I can say Guudey gave his life to spread a message to society. Anyone who hears that message, I hope they take something positive from it.\"\nGo to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent. \n Follow us on Twitter @BBCAfrica, on Facebook at BBC Africa or on Instagram at bbcafrica\nThe defendants get sentences of up to 66 years after a trial described by a defence lawyer as a farce.\nInhabitants of Sudan's biggest camp for displaced people have had their lives upturned once again.\nSeasoned business executive Tidjane Thiam is named as the candidate for Ivory Coast's main opposition party.\nA selection of the week's best photos from across the African continent and beyond.\nThe US says a new Zambian law is more intrusive than equivalents in many other countries.\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

With an election on the horizon, voters are wondering if any party has a plan to fix what has become a generational problem. \nWillow Yamauchi says she was just a \"regular\" person when she and her husband bought their family home in Vancouver 25 years ago for a modest sum of C$275,000 - around C$435,000 ($312,000; PS236,400) in today's dollars.\nThat same property is now worth several million. \nIn the city on Canada's west coast, Ms Yamauchi's story is as common as the rainy weather. The average price of a detached home in Vancouver in 2000 was around C$350,000. Now, it is more than C$2m.\n\"My husband and I were very privileged to be able to purchase a house when we did,\" the 52-year-old writer tells the BBC. As a member of Generation X, timing was on her side. \nThe same, she says, cannot be said for younger people, who - without \"the bank of mom and dad\" - are effectively priced out of the city they grew up in.\nVancouver, a cultural and economic hub with a population of less than one million, is often seen as the epicentre of Canada's housing crisis. A report by Chapman University in California last year listed it among the top \"impossibly unaffordable\" cities in the world. \nBut it is not the only Canadian city where the cost of homes is out of reach for many. Canada as a whole has one of the highest house-price-to-income ratios among developed nations.\nIn 2021, the average household income after taxes in Canada was around C$88,000, according to national data. That same year, the average home price hit C$713,500 - more than eight times higher. The gap is even larger in major cities like Toronto and Vancouver.\nFor many Canadians, housing is one of the top issues in the federal election, eclipsed only recently by US President Donald Trump and his tariffs on Canada. \nBefore Trump, concerns on housing affordability had boosted the Conservative Party, which has consistently been seen as the best equipped to fix the crisis. \nBut then a trade war with the US came along and it catapulted the governing Liberal party to the top of the polls.\nEven with the Trump factor, the topic featured prominently in the two election debates this week. During the French language one, moderator and journalist Patrice Roy displayed figures showing how much home prices had increased in Montreal, Toronto and Vancouver in the last decade. \n\"I'm sure this won't come as a surprise,\" Mr Roy told the federal leaders, before asking for their plans on how they would fix the crisis.\nPolls show young people are especially worried about the housing crisis and what it means for their future. \nSpeaking to students at the University of British Columbia's (UBC) Vancouver campus, it quickly became clear that the issue was top of mind for many.\nMany said they have either opted to live at home during their studies to save on costs, or are paying anywhere from C$1,100 to C$1,500 for a single room near campus, often in a home shared with five or six others.\nEmily Chu, a 24-year-old who is in her final semester at UBC, says that she at one point had to delay her studies by two years in order to work, as she struggled to afford paying both tuition and rent.\nShe now shares an apartment with her older brother, who works full-time and pays the majority of the rent. Ms Chu considers herself one of the lucky ones.\nAs for home ownership in the future, she says \"that's not even possible\" for most people her age. \"Everybody kind of assumes that we can't ever own housing.\"\nYoung professionals with well-paying jobs, like Margareta Dovgal, are also priced out. The 28-year-old director at Vancouver-based non-profit Resource Works told the BBC that she has considered moving to the neighbouring province of Alberta due to its lower cost of living, despite being a lifelong and \"committed Vancouverite\".\nStill, Calgary, Alberta's largest city, saw house prices increase by 15% in 2024 from the previous year as the city experienced its highest population growth rate since 2001.\nThe root causes of Canada's housing affordability crisis are complex. One of the main issues is a supply that has not kept up with a growing population, which has driven up costs for both buyers and renters. \nThe Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), the national housing agency, estimates that more than 3.8 million homes need to be built in the next six years to address the shortage.\nConstruction of new housing, however, has been well below that target, raising questions on whether Canada will meet this goal. Experts say barriers to ramping up building include the high cost and scarcity of land in urban areas, where most Canadians tend to live and work.\nThere are also regional barriers, like city zoning laws that prevent the construction of more affordable, higher density housing - including apartment buildings or multiplexes - in some neighbourhoods.\nDaniel Oleksiuk, co-founder of the advocacy group Abundant Housing Vancouver, says his city is one example, where more than half of the land has historically been zoned for single-family homes.\n\"We've kept almost all of the land reserved,\" Mr Oleksiuk told the BBC. \"There are whole neighbourhoods where all you have is three to five million dollar homes.\"\nOn the campaign trail, each major federal party has put forward a plan to fix the crisis, all with the goal of building as many homes as quickly as possible.\nThe Liberals, led by Mark Carney, said their aim is to build 500,000 new homes a year with the help of a new government agency called Build Canada Homes that would oversee and finance the construction of affordable housing in Canada - a plan similar to one implemented after the Second World War to house veterans.\nCritics have questioned whether Carney's target is viable, as it would require Canada to more than double its current construction rate.\nMeanwhile, the Conservatives, led by Pierre Poilievre, vowed to tie federal funding to housing starts by rewarding cities that build more homes and penalising those that block construction - a carrot-and-stick approach. \nPoilievre also promised to remove federal taxes on newly constructed homes in an effort to cut costs to would-be homebuyers. Critics, however, say this policy may have minimal effect, as most homes purchased in Canada are resold, rather than brand new.\nVoters who spoke to the BBC say they welcome any plan to ramp up housing construction in Canada.\nWhile much of housing is governed by provinces and cities, Ms Dovgal notes that the federal government has an ability \"to lead persuasively\" and implement measures that make it cheaper and easier to build across the country. \nBut others watching the issue closely caution that the steps proposed may not be enough. \nPaul Kershaw, a public policy professor at UBC and founder of think tank Generation Squeeze, argues that politicians have failed to address the elephant in the room: the wealth older homeowners have generated off the housing crisis.\n\"The political bargain has asked younger Canadians to suffer higher rents and mortgages in order to protect those higher home values,\" Kershaw notes.\n\"None of the parties are really naming that generational tension,\" he says, adding that politicians may privately feel there is a political risk in trying to stall the cost of housing, and thus, older Canadians' assets.\nProf Kershaw calls this a \"cultural problem\", and says that parties should also focus on reducing costs for younger people as a way to alleviate this generational burden.\nFixing the housing crisis, he argues, is just as integral as asserting sovereignty and prosperity in the face of threats posed by Trump's tariffs.\nThe \"dysfunction that has entered our housing market is disruptive to the well-being of the country\", he says. \nUntil a fix is found, the possibility of homeownership still looks bleak for many. \nMs Dovgal contends half-heartedly that, other than moving elsewhere, \"you have to win the lottery, or marry a multi-millionaire. These are kind of the options\".\nSeven voters across the political spectrum took us into their thoughts after watching candidates debate.\nThere were two ghosts in the room during Canada's federal election debate - Justin Trudeau and Donald Trump.\nFour party leaders faced off on Donald Trump, tariffs and security in the only English debate before Election Day.\nFrontrunner Mark Carney was tested in Wednesday's French-language debate, the first of two match-ups before the 28 April election.\nCanadian Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre is seeking to bring the Liberal Party's nine years in power to an end. \nCopyright 2025 BBC.

      "ml_hf_summary": "Canada faces a severe housing affordability crisis, with a significant shortage of homes and rising costs driving up rents and mortgages. The issue stems from a supply-demand imbalance exacerbated by limited land availability in urban areas and restrictive zoning laws. Major political parties have proposed solutions to increase housing construction, including the Liberal Party's plan to build 500,000 new homes annually and the Conservative Party's carrot-and-stick approach involving funding tied to construction rates. Critics argue that these measures may not be sufficient to address the underlying wealth disparity between generations, which has contributed to the crisis.  The debate on housing affordability is a key issue in the upcoming Canadian federal election, with voters seeking solutions to alleviate the burden of rising home costs and secure their future prospects. \n"

A few miles to the north of Bransholme lies the site of Meaux Abbey. Though little can be seen today, it was once a thriving Cistercian community.\nThe abbey was founded in about 1150 by William le Gros, the Earl of York.\n\"He acquired the name le Gros because of his size - he was said to be very, very fat in later life,\" says Neil.\nThe monks of Meaux developed a network of ditches to drain the land for farming. And in a time when there were few roads, the waterways would have been used for transporting people and goods between the abbey and the River Hull. \n\"To 21st Century eyes, we see quite a nice landscape around there, but back in the Middle Ages, it was a very barren, very hostile environment,\" Neil says.\n\"It needed to be tamed and that's what the monks were there to do. They were there to drain the land, make it more arable, be able to settle there, be able to farm.\"\nLife for the monks would have been difficult at times.\n\"It's perfectly plausible that some monks may have met a sudden or terrible end by working the landscape.\n\"Things like flash floods may have occurred, some of the drains collapsing on them. We know the River Hull altered its course in the mid-13th Century due to terrible rainfall, which literally altered the course to the course that we see today.\"\nThen in 1348 to 1349, the Black Death struck. It took out probably the vast majority of the monks.\n\"It would have been a painful, agonising and a really horrible, slow death for some of the monks, so perhaps that's the reason that these ghostly apparitions still appear.\n\"People put two and two together.\"\nMeaux Abbey was demolished in 1542 to provide stone for Henry VIII's castle and walls in Hull. Today, only earthworks remain.\nAnd while many people will dismiss the idea of ghostly monks haunting a housing estate, the tales do serve, at least, to keep the history of the site alive.\nVisit BBC Sounds to listen to the full series of Hidden East Yorkshire.\nListen to highlights from Hull and East Yorkshire on BBC Sounds, watch the latest episode of Look North or tell us about a story you think we should be covering here.\nIt may be set a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away, but Tony Gilroy's series takes a key plot from a bank heist masterminded by Stalin in 1907.\nCarbon dating reveals generations lived at the site for at least 400 years, says an archaeologist.\nRakhaldas Banerjee is credited with discovering Mohenjo-daro, but his legacy is tainted by controversy.\nThe building is where the English poet and artist wrote the words for the hymn Jerusalem. \nThe manuscript was unknown until it was bought by the University of Leeds at auction in 2023.\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

I felt like I'd been abandoned. I felt so disposable.\"\nAfter a few weeks of \"shutdown mode\" in lockdown, Kate-Lois had a \"burst of energy\".\nShe a web series, wrote an award-nominated book and - as venues \"slowly opened back up\" - started pursuing stand-up comedy.\n\"I see that as a gift in a way - having that time as an artist just for the love of it.

      "content": "Liverpool is known for its love of football and music but the importance it places on Easter clothes is much less known with those further afield. \nAccording to local retailers, people in the city will spend four months buying their Easter clothes - a tradition typically passed down from grandparents.\nNick Manning, who owns Melanie Louise, a children's clothing company with two shops based in Liverpool, said he has been taking orders since January. \n\"It's first come, best dressed,\" he said.\nHe added that Easter is a much busier time than Christmas in Liverpool. \n\"This is the weekend when it gets really busy,\" he said.\n\"People are running in for bows, socks, little cardigans with the weather getting a bit cooler.\n\"I have to tell our suppliers we need everything in way before Easter otherwise it's not worth sending.\"\nIt is believed Liverpool's links to the catholic community plays a big part in the city's obsession with Easter clothes as it is understood people would dress up for church.\nDr Terence Heng, from the department of sociology, social policy and criminology at the University of Liverpool pointed out, the act of buying new clothes does have roots in Catholicism. \nHe said: \"It is not uncommon for religious practices to morph into cultural practices over time, that is, the act or ritual remains but the religious significance becomes less obvious to those who practice it. \n\"Given the history of Liverpool, I wouldn't be surprised if there are connections between this religious act and the 'tradition' of buying new cloths for Easter.\"\nDr Jack Crangle, lecturer in contemporary British history at Queen's University Belfast, said the reason for the prominence of Easter dress in Liverpool compared to anywhere else is due to its Irish links. \nHe said: \"This is almost certainly a legacy of Irish migration to Liverpool over the centuries. \n\"Buying new Easter Clothes, especially for children, is a very common tradition among Catholics in Ireland. In 1851, 22.3% of Liverpool's residents were Irish-born and that heritage continues to be felt.\" \nHe added Liverpool has a reputation for being England's most Catholic city. According to the Archdiocese of Liverpool, over one in four Liverpool residents identified as Catholic in 2023. \n\"Therefore, it would make sense that the Easter Clothes tradition persists in Liverpool but not in other parts of the country.\" He added.\nMr Manning has his own views on why Easter clothes are such a big deal in Liverpool. \n\"I think we just like a good party,\" he said.\n\"It's just Liverpool, we celebrate anything we can and we like to be best dressed whatever the occasion.\n\"Most people go out and buy all their outfits just to go round their Nan's.\"\nThe founder of Liverpool Fashion Week Amanda Moss agrees and said: \"Easter signifies the start of the new season, spring is in full flow and it's a fresh start for many as they come out of winter hibernation. \n\"New clothes make people feel good. Going out in Liverpool is always an unofficial excuse for a fashion show.\"\n\"Style and presentation are a huge part of Scouse identity and is taken very seriously,\" she added.\nIn Liverpool, the tradition of buying Easter clothes has been passed down from generations and is now firmly in the minds of those much younger. \n\"We have a sports shop next door, and all day there's been young lads in and out getting their new trainers for Easter,\" Mr Manning said.\nAnd it is a tradition they are happy to inherit, according Mr Manning.\n\"We've had the shops since 1990 but my mum took over the business from my auntie 40 years ago,\" he said.\n\"We've been in the industry so long, we're dressing the grand kids and great grandkids of the kids we used to dress.\"\nHe said demand dropped briefly during Covid, but this led to new trends, like athleisure, which have influenced Easter clothes.\n\"We used to sell more signature pieces at higher price points, like your typical Easter Sunday dresses,\" he said\n\"Now it's a bit more toned down, we sell more casual stuff, but still in that Easter pallet. Lemon is still our most popular colour.\"\nListen to the best of BBC Radio Merseyside on Sounds and follow BBC Merseyside on Facebook, X, and Instagram.

For too many people it feels like nothing works anymore and the SNP need to face up to their part in that,\" he said.\n\"Russell Findlay has instead decided to continue the unconstructive, anti-everything behaviour which has already seen his Conservatives lose one MSP to the Liberal Democrats.\"\nThe call comes after the Supreme Court gave a legal definition of a woman under equality law. \nA parish council distances itself from social media posts by a member standing for local election.\nThe election, which is likely to be the last for the county council, will take place on 1 May.\nReform UK said it would not be commenting on the image, which was posted in 2019.\nNational Education Union members call for funds to be used to help campaign against Reform UK candidates.\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

RM Chivenor borders protected shellfish waters, a special area of conservation, and the River Taw - an important salmon river.\nPFAS, or per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, are a group of synthetic chemicals widely used in firefighting foams and industrial processes as well as in aconsumer products including waterproof fabrics, non-stick cookware, cosmetics and food packaging. They are known as forever chemicals because they do not break down easily in the environment, and have been found polluting soil and water across the world. Some PFAS build up in the human body over time and have been linked to a range of serious health problems including cancers, immune system disruption and reproductive disorders.\nMilitary bases with airfields have used firefighting foams laden with PFAS for decades. Certain chemicals in foams including PFOS, PFOA and PFHxS have been linked to diseases and banned, but they remain in the environment.\nProf Hans Peter Arp, from the Norwegian University of Science and Technology, said contamination at UK military sites would not be surprising. \"Most, if not all, military bases in Europe and around the world have used vast quantities of firefighting foams that contain PFAS,\" he said. \"They now have substantial PFAS concentrations in the soil and groundwater beneath them, as well as soaked into the concrete of their buildings.\"\nHe warned that PFAS pollution will continue for \"decades to centuries\" unless immediate local clean-up actions are taken. \"These PFAS that are leaching now likely took several decades to get there. There are more PFAS to come.\"\nThis month the Environmental Audit Committee launched a formal inquiry into PFAS contamination and regulation across the UK. Campaigners and scientists warn that until the full scale of PFAS pollution is understood and addressed, the threat to human health and the environment will continue to grow.\nAlex Ford, professor of biology at the University of Portsmouth, said: \"The EA has now identified thousands of high-risk sites around the UK with elevated concentrations of PFAS compounds. These forever chemicals are being detected in our soils, rivers, groundwater, our wildlife - and us.\n\"It is very worrying to hear PFAS is being detected ... close to drinking water sources. The quicker we get this large family of chemicals banned the better, as their legacy will outlive everybody alive today.\"\nHe added that the cost of cleaning up these pollutants could run into the billions - costs that, he argued, should be footed by the chemical industry.\nNot all water treatment works can remove PFAS, and upgrades would be costly. A spokesperson for Water UK, which represents the water industry, said: \"PFAS pollution is a huge global challenge. We want to see PFAS banned and the development of a national plan to remove it from the environment, which should be paid for by manufacturers.\"\nProf Crispin Halsall, an environmental chemist at Lancaster University, called for greater transparency and collaboration. \"The MoD shouldn't try to hide things. They should come clean and set up monitoring,\" he said.\nThe UK's monitoring of PFAS is trailing behind the US, where contamination on military sites has been the focus of billions of dollars in federal spending on testing and clean-up operations.\nIn July, the US Environmental Protection Agency and US Army launched a joint project to sample private drinking-water wells near army installations. UK authorities only recently began to investigate the scale of the problem.\nBrad Creacey, a former US air force firefighter, spent decades training with firefighting foam on military bases across the US and Europe. During fire exercises, Creacey and his colleagues would ignite contaminated jet fuel and extinguish it with AFFF (aqueous film-forming foams) - often wearing old suits that were soaked and never cleaned. On one occasion he was doused in the foams for fun.\nTwenty years after he had stopped working with the foams, a blood test revealed that Creacey still had high PFOS levels in his blood. He has been diagnosed with thyroid cancer and now suffers from Hashimoto's disease, high cholesterol and persistent fatigue.\n\"We've taken on too much of a lackadaisical attitude about this contamination,\" he said. \"Unless this is taken seriously, we're doomed.\"\nCreacey is pursuing compensation through the US Department of Veterans Affairs and a separate lawsuit against 3M and DuPont.\nPete Thompson is a former Royal Air Force firefighter who served at several UK airbases including RAF Coningsby in Lincolnshire. During his service he regularly used firefighting foams in training exercises and equipment tests, and said they usually sprayed them directly on to grass fields with no containment.\n\"We used the foam in the back of what was called a TACR 1 - basically a Land Rover with a 450-litre tank of premixed foam on the back. Every six months we had to do a production test to prove that the system worked. That production test we just produced on to the grass ... there was no way of stopping it going anywhere other than just draining in through the ground.\"\nThe MoD is working with the EA to assess its sites, and work has begun to investigate whether to restrict PFAS in firefighting foams. Military sites are not the only sources of PFAS pollution - commercial airports, firefighting training grounds, manufacturers, landfills, paper mills and metal plating plants can also create contamination problems.\nAn EA spokesperson said: \"The global science on PFAS is evolving rapidly, and we are undertaking a multi-year programme to better understand sources of PFAS pollution in England. We have developed a risk screening approach to identify potential sources of PFAS pollution and prioritise the sites for further investigation. We have used this tool to assist the MoD in developing its programme of voluntary investigations and risk assessments.\"\nA government spokesperson said: \"There is no evidence that drinking water from our taps exceeds the safe levels of PFAS, as set out by the Drinking Water Inspectorate.\n\"Our rapid review of the Environmental Improvement Plan will look at the risks posed by PFAS and how best to tackle them to deliver our legally binding targets to save nature.\"\nThe guidelines for 48 types of PFAS in drinking water is 0.1 micrograms per litre (100 nanograms per litre).\nEarlier this year, Watershed Investigations uncovered MoD documents raising concerns that some RAF bases might be hotspots of forever chemical pollution. In 2022, the Guardian reported that Duxford airfield - a former RAF base now owned by the Imperial War Museum - was probably the source of PFOS-contaminated drinking water in South Cambridgeshire. The site is now under investigation by the EA.\nPatrick Byrne, professor of water science at Liverpool John Moores University, said current monitoring efforts only scratch the surface. \"We're at the tip of the iceberg. We're only monitoring a handful of PFAS compounds. There are many others we don't yet fully understand or detect.\n\"There are tests that measure the total PFAS load in water, and we're finding huge discrepancies between those results and the levels of individual compounds. That tells us there's a lot more PFAS in the environment than we know.\"\nEven where testing is under way, labs are overwhelmed. \"The Environment Agency's lab is inundated. Private labs can't keep up either,\" he said. \"Analytical technology is improving fast - but we're racing to keep pace.\"",
      "ml_hf_summary": "Three UK military bases (RAF Marham, RM Chivenor, and AAC Middle Wallop) are under investigation for potential PFAS contamination of drinking water sources and the environment. The Ministry of Defence (MoD) will conduct investigations using a new risk screening tool developed by the Environment Agency (EA).  PFAS, or per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, are \"forever chemicals\" used in firefighting foams and industrial processes that have been linked to health problems like cancer and immune system disruption. These chemicals can persist in the environment for decades and require extensive clean-up efforts. The EA has identified thousands of high-risk sites with elevated PFAS concentrations across the UK.  The US is investing billions in PFAS testing and cleanup, while the UK's monitoring efforts are lagging behind. Campaigners and scientists warn that until PFAS pollution is addressed, its impact on human health and the environment will continue to grow. \n"

      "content": "High-end bar with Middle East-style nut filling is rationed in shops as price of raw kernels surges\nProduct promotion on TikTok is now powerful enough to influence the vast agricultural economies of the US and Iran - at least when it comes to the consumption of high-end confectionery.\nA chocolate bar stuffed with a creamy green pistachio filling has become incredibly popular after a series of video clips shared on the social media site. The first bit of footage praising the taste of the expensive so-called \"Dubai chocolate\" was posted at the end of 2023 and has now been viewed more than 120m times, to say nothing of the many follow-up videos.\nThe result has been an international shortage of the vital ingredient, pistachio kernels, which are largely grown in either the US or Iran. In a year, prices have surged from $7.65 to $10.30 a pound, Giles Hacking, from nut trader CG Hacking, told the Financial Times.\nThe nut was already becoming scarce due to last year's poor harvest in the US, the world's leading exporter. Although that crop was smaller than usual, it was of higher quality and so was largely sold as whole nuts, still in their shells. This has created a further shortage of the basic kernels used in the chocolate bars.\nIranian producers, meanwhile, had exported 40% more nuts to the UAE in the six months to March than they had in the 12 months prior to that.\nDubai chocolate mania can be sourced to the creation of a bar that combined milk chocolate, the shredded pastry known as kataifi, and a pistachio cream filling. Made by the swish Emirati chocolatier Fix, which only sells in the UAE, it was prophetically given the punning name Can't Get Knafeh of It, in reference to a traditional Arab dessert.\nOther leading chocolate makers, such as Laderach and Lindt, quickly created their own pistachio chocolate products, but are now struggling to meet international demand. Charles Jandreau, the general manager for Prestat Group, which owns several luxury British chocolate brands, told the FT that the demand for the bars has surprised the industry. \"It feels like it came out of nowhere,\" he said. \"Suddenly you see it in every corner shop.\"\nSome stores are reportedly rationing the number of bars sold at one time. Testament, then, either to the power of TikTok influencers, or the rather more established appeal of tasty chocolate.",
      "ml_hf_summary": "A high-end chocolate bar called \"Dubai Chocolate\" featuring pistachio filling has become extremely popular due to viral TikTok videos. This popularity has led to a global shortage of pistachio kernels, primarily grown in the US and Iran, causing prices to surge from $7.65 to $10.30 per pound. The shortage is exacerbated by last year's poor US pistachio harvest, which resulted in higher-quality nuts being sold whole rather than kernels. Iranian producers have also increased exports to the UAE, further contributing to the supply issue.  As a result of this demand surge, some stores are reportedly rationing the number of bars sold at one time. \n"

      "content": "Everton 0-1 Manchester City If it stays like City will leapfrog Nottingham Forest and move into fourth. Forest have a vital game at Spurs on Monday night.\nIt's all square at the Olympic Stadium!\nAnd Dani Olmo has given Barcelona a lifeline, running onto Raphinha's nice through ball to score with his left foot.\nKaoru Mitoma gives Brighton hope with a typically classy finish.\nA big goal at Goodison Park. Nico O'Reilly, who is emerging as the unlikely hero of City's season, has put them ahead with a smart close-range finish from Matheus Nunes's excellent cross.\nScenes upon scenes at the Olympic Stadium, where Borja Iglesias has scored a hat-trick for Celta Vigo! Barcelona's defending was astonishingly bad: one long punt from the back put Borja - who started inside his own half - away from the defence and through on goal. He approached Szczesny and dinked the ball daintily into the corner. Lovely finish, hideous defending.\nBrentford 3-1 Brighton A nice moment at the Gtech Stadium: Brentford's Rico Henry, who has played barely ten minutes of Premier League football since September 2023, has come on as substitute.\nPalace 0-0 Bournemouth Apart from the red card, the highlight of this game is probably Justin Kluivert pulling Ismaila Sarr's shorts down at the start of the second half.

City have a kind run-in so a draw at Goodison wouldn't be a bad result, even if it would mean they could finish the weekend as low as seventh in the table.\nWest Ham 1-0 Southampton Niclas Fullkrug has had a goal disallowed for a foul on Aaron Ramsdale.\nFull time: Heidenheim 0-4 Bayern Munich \nA nice, quiet afternoon for Bayern Munich, who are closing in on their first Bundesliga title since 2023. Harry Kane gave them an early lead, with the other goals coming from Konrad Laimer, Kingsley Coman and Joshua Kimmich.\nBrentford 3-1 Brighton Joaoa Pedro has been sent off for throwing an elbow at Nathan Collins; a straight red card and Brighton are officially in all sorts.\nYoane Wissa puts Brentford 3-1 up.

It doesn't offend me to know that Simon Hooper hails from Wiltshire, but what significance does it bear on him refereeing between Everton and City?

Anyway, just curious.\"\nIn this specific case it's because I lazily cut and pasted the whole thing from the wires, then put each team in formation and forgot about the referee.

      "content": "News outlets pull articles featuring 'psychologist and sex adviser' Barbara Santini amid doubts over her credentials\nOver the past couple of years, the Oxford-educated psychologist Barbara Santini has been widely quoted as an expert. She has contributed thoughts on everything from the psychological impact of the Covid pandemic to the importance of vitamin D and how playing darts can improve your health.\nHowever, her pronouncements have begun to disappear from articles after concerns that Santini may not be all that she appears. Major news outlets have removed entire articles featuring Santini, or comments made by her, after a series of questions were raised over her qualifications - and even whether her entire identity could be an elaborate hoax.\nThe case has been described as a wake-up call for newsrooms, as AI tools make it far easier for bad actors to invent supposed experts for their own purposes. Santini's output has been prolific, with comments in Vogue, Metro, Cosmopolitan, the i newspaper, the Express, Hello!, the Telegraph, the Daily Star, the Daily Mail and the Sun in recent years. She was also quoted in an article for the BBC's international site, BBC.com.\nOn closer inspection, her main online presence is as a sex and relationships adviser at an online sex toy outlet, Peaches and Screams. Some of the articles featuring her include a link to the store. Her qualifications are described there as \"psychologist and sex adviser - University of Oxford\". However, the British Psychological Society (BPS) said she was not one of its members. She does not appear to have social media profiles, though she has two followers on the blogging site Medium.\nQuestions over Santini were first raised by the Press Gazette. Peaches and Screams did not respond to repeated requests for comment. The Guardian made several attempts to reach her through a number understood to be connected to her, asking for a meeting or conference call to confirm her identity as well as verification of her qualifications. A message was eventually received stating: \"Thank you for your interest in this matter.\" No further verification was provided.\nSome of the reporters who have quoted her said they received comments through companies that connect journalists with experts. Some cited one such service, ResponseSource. The company has now launched an investigation and suspended the PR agency that handled Santini, and is planning a peer review system that allows journalists to rate an expert they have featured.\nSantini also briefly featured on Qwoted, another platform connecting experts to journalists. Shelby Bridges, its director of user success, said the profile was removed after it found \"immediate red flags pertaining to credentials and where the account was being accessed from\". She added: \"Due to our inability to fully validate her credentials, we disabled the account shortly after it was created.\"\nReach, which owns the Daily Mirror, Daily Express and Daily Star, is among the news outlets removing Santini from its coverage. This includes a Daily Star article in which Santini talked about how darts improved qualities such as \"planning, foresight and problem-solving\".\nAlso removed was a Daily Mirror story in which Santini said the Covid pandemic had left some people with \"difficulties establishing new relationships, heightened irritability, or a tendency to avoid social situations entirely\". The Guardian has removed her comments from an advertising feature on its website.\nThe BBC has removed her comments from a piece about AI by BBC Future, commissioned by BBC.com. A BBC spokesperson said: \"As a widely used commentator, Barbara Santini's quotes were used in good faith by BBC Future. While the substance of the article remains valid and her contribution was minor, given we have been unable to confirm Santini's credentials, we have removed her quotes from the piece.\"\nThe Independent has removed several stories that featured Santini commenting on subjects such as the differences between abuse and BDSM, as well as the importance of vitamin D. Yahoo has removed Santini's quotes from articles, adding the clarification: \"An earlier version of this story included information from a source whose expertise may not be valid. The quotes from the source have been removed.\"\nWhile the details of Santini's case remain unclear, it has raised the issue of how journalists verify the credentials of sources in the AI age. Charlie Beckett, the leader of the journalism and AI project at the London School of Economics, said: \"This is about long-running pressures on journalists to be quicker. This is not the AI itself that's at fault here. This is unscrupulous people, it seems. It is a wake-up call to all of us, frankly.\"\nRoman Raczka, the president of the BPS, said: \"Working with a professional membership body such as the British Psychological Society provides peace of mind to all reporters that they are speaking to a real person.\"",
      "ml_hf_summary": "Barbara Santini, an Oxford-educated psychologist and sex advisor, has seen her quotes removed from numerous news articles after concerns about her qualifications surfaced.  Questions were raised regarding her credentials, including whether her identity is genuine, following reports of her prolific output in various publications like Vogue and the Daily Mail. Major news outlets have removed articles featuring Santini or her comments, citing a lack of verification. The case has prompted investigations by platforms like ResponseSource and Qwoted, which are implementing new measures to verify expert credentials.

      "content": "In-cab digital signalling was tested last week as part of a project to secure the future of main-line locomotives\nAbout 500 steam trains run across the UK each year, from Penzance in the south to Inverness in the north, transporting tens of thousands of passengers to a bygone age, bringing joy to the faces of enthusiasts and bemusing commuters.\nBut the future of main line steam operations could be under threat unless the traditional fire-breathing machines can be fitted with pioneering modern technology.\nThe UK's railways are undergoing a major change to their signalling systems in the coming years. Network Rail is planning to remove traditional lineside colour light signals in favour of in-cab signalling systems along key routes. No steam locomotive in the world had ever been run with in-cab digital signalling - until now.\nOn a Monday night earlier this month, the new technology was trialled for the first time as part of a \"pathfinder\" project aimed at securing the future of steam locomotives in the UK.\nThe \"A1\" No.60163 Tornado - Britain's first steam locomotive to be built in 50 years and which has appeared in the Paddington 2 movie and on Top Gear - has been fitted with European Train Control System (ETCS) technology as part of a Network Rail-led initiative which was launched in 2021. Fitting the new technology cost about PS9m.\nETCS is to be rolled out across the country in the coming years and some trains will run in digital-only mode from the end of this year.\nIt is already widely used in Europe and is seen as the industry standard signalling system for high-speed lines. Since 2011, the Cambrian Coast Line has been operated exclusively using the system as part of a different pilot programme.\nThe Tornado ran west of Shrewsbury to Newtown and Welshpool overnight to trial the technology for the first time.\n\"It is existential to the sector if steam cannot run with ETCS ... the team have done a brilliant job of getting us to this point,\" a Network Rail spokesperson involved in the project told the Observer. \"The pathfinder [project] is all about saying 'this is going to be really hard, is it technically viable?' Nobody has ever done it with a heritage vehicle.\"\nSince the privatisation of the railways, steam trains have been free to roam the national network subject to there being \"white space\" in the timetables around service trains.\n\"We had quite a few challenges fitting the systems,\" Rob Morland, electrical engineer at The A1 Steam Locomotive Trust, Tornado's owning group, told the Observer. \"This is a very harsh environment: we've got heat, coal, coal dust, shocks and vibrations and they all stress the systems.\"\nA second steam-powered turbo generator, an axle-driven alternator and a dedicated battery bank had to be installed in order to power the equipment: \"The cab was stripped back to bare metal because of the sheer number of new conduits, boxes and equipment and that was the only practical way to do it,\" Morland added.\nAmy Clouston, principal human factors specialist at engineering consultancy AtkinsRealis, which designed the fitment of the systems, said: \"We had to test whether or not you can even use a touchscreen while you're hurtling along at up to 75mph. We've had to think about vibrations, lighting, noise, coal dust, water and steam and grubby fingers.\"\nClouston said her team also had to factor in the placement of the screens to avoid being hit by a fireman swinging a shovel around, while still being in a position where the driver can still see the safety-critical information displayed.\n\"Drivers have varied positions: some drivers hang out of the cab, others stand. It isn't a 'I'm sat at a desk' design of a modern diesel or electric locomotive,\" she said.\nKeeping the computers powering the systems cool also proved to be a headache: \"The design team had the challenge of sealing them [against] coal dust and heat. Electronics in a sealed environment that's already hot does not bode well [for the longevity],\" she added.\n\"Tornado's retrofit with our ETCS is a world-first project that has tested our technology in one of the most complex and harsh operating environments, proving heritage and digital systems can coexist without compromise,\" Tank Porteous, main line signalling programme director at Hitachi Rail UK, a partner in the project, said.\nTornado is so far the only steam locomotive to have been fitted with the system. Last year Network Rail issued a PS40m tender document for companies to bid to fit 24 main line steam and heritage diesel locomotives.\n\"The price of future fitments will be significantly cheaper, there's no doubt about that, but we don't know yet exactly what that might be,\" the NR spokesperson said.\n\"We need to work out how commercially viable it is going to be. This is going to form part of where we go in the future.\"\nThe spokesperson told the Observer the team have \"learned more in the extremes with Tornado than we will do anywhere elsewhere\" and the results will influence the design of equipment that will be fitted.\nAtkinsRealis's Clouston said the project was vital to the future of the main line steam sector: \"Steam is part of the nation's engineering heritage so it would be such a shame if it were to only be contained to private, heritage railways. Having steam locomotives out there on the main line is a wonderful thing to see.\"",
      "ml_hf_summary": "Network Rail conducted a pathfinder project to test in-cab digital signaling on Britain's A1 Tornado steam locomotive. The project involved installing European Train Control System (ETCS) technology, marking the first time such technology was used with a heritage steam locomotive.  The testing took place west of Shrewsbury and Newtown, aiming to assess the feasibility of integrating ETCS into main line steam operations. This initiative is part of Network Rail's plan to transition from traditional lineside color light signals to in-cab digital systems over the coming years. The project involved significant engineering challenges due to the harsh operating environment of a steam locomotive, including heat, vibrations, and coal dust.  The success of this project could pave the way for wider adoption of ETCS on main line steam locomotives, potentially securing their future on the national network. \n"

      "content": "Alla Shyrshonkova was on a bus when Russian missiles hit the city. Now a toy bear and hippo mark the spot where 35 people, including two children, were killed\nLast weekend, Alla Shyrshonkova got on the 62 bus on a journey to her cottage near the Ukrainian city of Sumy. It was a warm spring day. \"I thought I'd sit with friends, have some tea. Birds were singing. The weather was beautiful. It was so nice,\" she recalled.\n\"The bus was packed. There wasn't a single free seat. People were standing. Some were going to church for Palm Sunday. There were families with children.\"\nAs she reached the city centre she heard a loud bang. Two minutes later - as the bus made its way down Petropavlivska street - there was a second massive explosion. \"The blast was in front of me, so I didn't see it. I only heard it. I was sitting behind the driver, with my back to him. When I heard the noise, I covered my head with my hands and ducked.\"\nAfter that, she said, \"rocks, glass and everything went flying\". Shyrshonkova lifted her head. Blood was gushing \"like a fountain\" from her arm. \"I saw cars on fire and smoke. People were lying at my feet. I said to them: 'Get up, get up.' They were silent.\"\nA conductor called the name of the driver - \"Kolya\" - but there was no reply. Passengers tried to climb out of a window. Eventually, a teenage boy opened a door and she staggered out.\nThe double strike on Sumy was the bloodiest single moment this year in Russia's murderous war against Ukraine. The Iskander ballistic missiles carried deadly cluster of munitions which released a wave of shrapnel. Thirty-five people were killed.\nTwo of the victims buried last week were children, aged eleven and seven. Sumy residents left toys at the spot where they perished: a bear, a hippo, a toy car and a football.\nShyrshonkova was one of 129 people wounded. Among them are 15 children. Some are critically injured, hovering \"between life and death\", as Tetyana, a nurse at Sumy's general hospital, told the Observer. The first missile crashed into a university congress centre, plunging through a glass atrium and a basement theatre. The second turned the city into a vision of hell, with bodies on the ground and a little girl crying and covered in blood.\nThe war seems further away than ever from a peaceful resolution. On Friday, Donald Trump signalled he is ready to \"take a pass\" on brokering an agreement unless the two sides reach a deal \"very shortly\".\nMore than a month ago, Ukraine accepted a US proposal for a 30-day ceasefire. Russia didn't. Since then, it has demonstratively escalated its bombing campaign on civilians and infrastructure, hitting Sumy, Kharkiv and Dnipro.\nAs many predicted, Trump's negotiating strategy has been to favour Russia. He has effectively ended military assistance to Kyiv, while falsely blaming Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Joe Biden for \"starting\" the war.\nNo similar pressure has been applied to Moscow. Trump downplayed last weekend's Sumy strike, calling it a \"mistake\". His special envoy, Steve Witkoff - who met European leaders on Thursday - parrots Kremlin disinformation.\nSpeaking from hospital, survivors expressed anger at the US president, accusing him of laziness and a bewildering partisanship. \"What happened in Sumy is terror, obviously - nothing else,\" Shyrshonkova said. \"Trump is basically supporting Russia now.\n\"I wish he would come to Ukraine and see what his beloved puylo [a slang term for Putin, meaning prick] is doing. I want Trump to help us at the same level as Joe Biden.\"\nAnother wounded survivor, 72-year-old Hennadii Smoliarov, said the Russians were carrying out genocide. \"They are trying to destroy all Ukrainians. They hate us. Putin says we are not a people.\n\"They promote the concept of Russkiy Mir or 'Russian World'. That means conquering everywhere.\"\nSmoliarov said that, when he was studying in Moscow in the 1980s, he was called a Khokhol, a derogatory term for Ukrainians. \"Prejudice is widespread,\" he noted.\nHe had been sitting on the 62 bus, having gone into town to fetch eyedrops for his wife, Anna. After the first strike the bus stopped outside Sumy state university's institute of applied physics. Shrapnel from the second missile hit his lung and head. \"There was a strong shockwave. You couldn't see inside. The smoke was like a fog, it was so thick.\"\nA woman lay motionless at his feet. \"I lost strength and collapsed right inside the bus,\" he recalled.\nA volunteer grabbed Smoliarov by the collar of his brown leather jacket and dragged him on to the pavement.\nThe explosion blew the wooden doors and glass from the 19th-century institute, sending shards into its garden and flowerbeds. A quartz wall clock on the ground floor stopped at the moment of impact: 10.20am and 40 seconds. Across the road, a giant hole was gouged in the white-painted economics and business faculty building.\nAnother wounded survivor, Viktor Voitenko, said Sumy was in its fourth year of war. \"We've had so many attacks, with Shahed drones and missiles,\" he said. \"The air raids don't stop.\"\nThe city, a key military hub, is located less than 20 miles from Russia. From here, Ukraine's armed forces launched a surprise mini-invasion last August into Russia's neighbouring Kursk region. They withdrew in March. Fighting continues in villages along the border, where Ukrainian troops hold a sliver of Russian territory.\nVoitenko works at the physics institute as a security guard. He was in the foyer when the second Iskander dropped. A metal fragment hit him in the spine. \"I couldn't feel my legs. I called my wife and she reached me in five minutes. After that, the police took me to a safe place,\" he said.\nLying in a hospital bed, Voitenko said it was unclear if he would walk again: \"It's in God's hands. My operation went well. The doctors say they can't guarantee anything.\"\nAged 56, Voitenko previously worked as a builder and as a \"liquidator\" - a member of the clean-up crew sent to the Chornobyl nuclear power station after the 1986 disaster.\nThe Kremlin, he said, was addicted to reckless imperialism. \"Before the war, we lived well. We had everything. I have a beautiful wife, an 11-year-old daughter and two cars.\"\nThe bus driver, Mykola Leon - killed on Palm Sunday, together with most of his passengers - was a distant relative, he said.\nShyrshonkova spoke to the Observer from the neighbouring hospital room. She put her survival down to a class she attended in the 1950s as a schoolgirl in the Soviet Union.\n\"We had civil defence lessons. The teachers told us capitalism was bad. They also explained what to do in the event of a nuclear attack. We were taught to keep our mouth closed and to cover our head and eyes.\n\"When I heard the explosion on Sunday it came back to me. Some instinct took over,\" she said.\nOnce she left hospital, Shyrshonkova said she hoped to visit her dacha. \"I've planted tomatoes and peppers on the balcony. I want to see them growing.\"\nLuke Harding's Invasion: Russia's Bloody War and Ukraine's Fight for Survival, shortlisted for the Orwell prize, is published by Guardian Faber",

      "content": "Revulsion at deadly Oklahoma City explosion in 1995 has faded. But echoes of the blast, and its perpetrator, Timothy McVeigh, are heard today as far-right ideas storm the US\nThe world's first reaction to the young military veteran and far-right radical who blew up a federal building in Oklahoma City 30 years ago this month was near-universal revulsion at the carnage he created and at the ideology that inspired it.\nA crowd yelled \"baby killer\" - and worse - as 26-year-old Timothy McVeigh was led away in chains from a courthouse in rural Oklahoma where the FBI caught up with him two days after the bombing. He had the same crew cut he'd sported in his army days and stone cold eyes.\nAn hour and a half's drive to the south, 168 people lay dead, most of them office workers who had been providing government services, along with 19 young children in a day care centre directly above the spot where McVeigh parked his moving truck packed with ammonium nitrate and other explosives.\nThe children were, most likely, his prime target.\nBill Clinton, then president, rallied the country by vowing justice that would be \"swift, certain and severe\". His attorney general wasted no time announcing she would seek the death penalty. Whatever flirtation the country had been entertaining with rightwing militia movements in the wake of a national assault weapons ban that enraged gun rights activists, and controversies over the heavy-handedness of federal law enforcement, came screeching to a halt.\nEven elements of the radical right, McVeigh's fellow travellers, were stunned by the sight of firefighters pulling dead babies out of the wreckage. Before the bombing, they had been full of heady talk of war against the government, but many of them imagined this would involve an attack on federal judges who had displeased the movement, or blowing up a building at night.\n\"Didn't he case the place?\" one acquaintance of McVeigh's asked incredulously. \"The bastard has put the Patriot movement back 30 years,\" lamented an erstwhile mentor of McVeigh's from Arizona.\nFast-forward those 30 years, and the movement is not only very much revived but has moved from the outer fringes of American politics to the very centre.\nMcVeigh wanted to strike at what he saw as a corrupt, secretive cabal running the US government - what Donald Trump and his acolytes refer to as the Deep State and are now busy dismantling.\nMcVeigh believed the US had no business extending its influence around the world or becoming entangled in foreign wars when white working-class Americans from industrial cities such as Buffalo, his home town, were suffering - an early expression of Trump's America First ideology, which won him tens of millions of blue-collar votes last November.\nMcVeigh's favourite book, a white supremacist power fantasy called The Turner Diaries, blamed a cabal of Jews, black people and internationalists for perverting America's true destiny - a sentiment now finding coded expression in Trump's twin wars on immigration and on diversity, equity and inclusion.\nMcVeigh believed it was up to ordinary citizens like him to take up arms and fight against a tyrannical ruling order, no matter the cost in innocent lives, because that was what the country's founders had done during the American civil war. The T-shirt he wore when he was arrested carried a quote from Thomas Jefferson: \"The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants.\"\nDuring the Capitol riot on 6 January 2021, the QAnon-friendly Republican congresswoman Lauren Boebert expressed much the same sentiment as she cheered on the rioters smashing and bloodying their way past uniformed police officers into the halls of Congress. \"Today is 1776,\" she tweeted.\nThe parallels have not been lost on political veterans of the 1990s. Clinton himself observed in a recent HBO documentary: \"The words [McVeigh] used, the arguments he made, literally sound like the mainstream today. Like he won!\"\nThe threat the far right poses to the US government is no longer a physical one - not when it comes to the executive branch, anyway - since the radicals intent on cleaning house now have like-minded leaders such as Trump and Elon Musk doing it from the inside. It's hard to imagine McVeigh, who was executed by lethal injection in 2001, objecting to the administration's campaign to hollow out the international aid agency, kick career prosecutors and government watchdogs out of the Department of Justice, or vow to refashion \"broken\" institutions such as the FBI.\n\"Their beliefs and values are allied,\" said Janet Napolitano, who in 1995 played an administrative role in the bombing investigation as US attorney for Arizona and went on to run the Department of Homeland Security under President Obama. \"It is a far cry to say that there are people in political power in the United States now who want to blow up federal buildings. We have to be very clear about that. But the notion that the country has somehow been stolen from them, that it's run by elites, that they are trying to take away our guns - that has become a very accepted view among many.\"\nPresent and former members of the governing class still have reason to fear threats from the far right, either because they have been tagged as Deep State enemies by groups such as the Proud Boys and the Oath Keepers, or because they have been identified by President Trump as targets for \"retribution\".\nThose threats, in the Trump era, have included a foiled plot to kidnap Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer and a hammer attack on the husband of then House speaker Nancy Pelosi. In concert with the administration, activists sympathetic to Trump have engaged in doxxing and other forms of harassment at people deemed to be political enemies and their families, including whistleblowers, college campus protesters and former associates turned critics of the president. \nSeasoned national security experts like Napolitano fear it may not stop there, however, and worry particularly about judges who have issued rulings hostile to administration interests. \"Those far-right groups - they've all been given permission,\" she said. \"Pardoning all the January 6 defendants sends a terrible message about the rule of law in this country, just like purging from DoJ and the FBI sends a terrible message.\"\nSign up to Headlines US\nGet the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morning\nafter newsletter promotion\nIt was a very different world when McVeigh washed out of the army in 1991 following his service in the first Gulf war. After bouncing from one dead-end job to another and racking up thousands in sports gambling debts, he hit the road in his Chevy Geo Spectrum to sell army surplus supplies and copies of The Turner Diaries at gun shows around the country. This was the very definition of a marginal existence.\nMcVeigh was part of a cohort of so-called \"angry young men\" who felt the brunt of a downturn in manufacturing and defence contracting jobs at the end of the cold war and found their solace in guns, gun culture, and radical politics verging on the paranoid. Talk at the gun shows - which one violence prevention group memorably nicknamed \"Tupperware parties for criminals\" - obsessed over black helicopters and jack-booted government thugs. McVeigh himself told people the government had inserted a computer chip in his backside.\nSome of the movement's loudest grievances were entirely genuine. McVeigh kept a list of raids that federal law enforcement agencies conducted in the name of the War on Drugs and the innocent people caught up in them through error or inadvertence. He was appalled when the feds besieged a cabin in the Idaho mountains in October 1992, killing both the wife and the 14-year-old son of a survivalist who had refused to act as an informant on the far right. And he was appalled all over again the following spring by a second botched raid at a religious compound outside Waco, Texas, culminating in a deadly fire that killed more than 80 men, women and children.\nIn Washington, these events were not generally viewed as indications of deep structural rot, but rather as operational screw-ups to be addressed through internal after-action reports and congressional review. McVeigh, though, was shocked by the sight of Bradley fighting vehicles moving in to force an end to the Waco siege, because he had driven Bradleys in the Gulf and, as a decorated military gunner, knew just how deadly they could be. Using them against civilians, including children, struck him as an abomination that cried out for revenge.\nDespite his later protestations to the contrary, compelling evidence suggests that McVeigh targeted the daycare centre as revenge for the children who died at Waco. The centre's operator, Danielle Hunt, told the FBI she remembered McVeigh visiting four months before the bombing, pretending to be an active member of the military with his own young children. He asked a lot of strange questions about security, she recalled, looked at the windows and said, over and over, \"There's so much glass\".\nThe FBI confirmed that McVeigh was indeed in Oklahoma City at the time, along with his friend and fellow veteran Michael Fortier, who ended up cutting a deal with prosecutors in exchange for his testimony against McVeigh at trial.\nWhen agents first showed photographs of the dead children to Fortier, he showed no empathy for them, according to contemporary FBI records. Rather, he jumped out of his seat and exclaimed: \"This is about Waco! Those parents did not kill their own children!\"\n\"These guys were just evil people,\" said Kenneth Williams, one of the first FBI agents to question Fortier. To this day, Williams believes Fortier should have received a far harsher sentence than the 12 years he and the government agreed on.\nLargely because of the children, the radical far right soon abandoned its dream of overthrowing the government by force. Even McVeigh, who had hoped to be seen as a hero and a martyr to the cause, came to wonder if he shouldn't have opted for targeted killings of federal agents instead of indiscriminate slaughter.\nMuch of the high emotion surrounding the bombing has been lost in the intervening decades. Outside of Oklahoma, few Americans under 30 know much, if anything, about it. In the age of Trump, that looks like a lost opportunity - for the country to understand the nature of the disillusionment and rage building for decades in \"rust belt\" cities and in farming communities across the heartland.\nPart of the reason for that lost opportunity is the US government's failure at trial to tell the full story of who McVeigh was, the subculture he moved in, and the deep ideological wellsprings that led to his act of folly. For reasons largely dictated by courtroom expediency, prosecutors chose to depict McVeigh as a lone mastermind, with significant help from only one person, another fellow army veteran named Terry Nichols, who later confessed to helping McVeigh buy materials for the bomb and assemble it.\n\"Two evil men did this, and two men paid,\" the Oklahoma governor at the time of the bombing, Frank Keating, said when the trials were over. Yet few in government or on the prosecution team believed that everyone involved in the plot had been caught, or that those who had been identified necessarily received the punishment they deserved.\n\"Some people got away with bloody murder, Fortier being one of them,\" Williams, the former FBI agent, said.\nThe government dropped several promising lines of investigation - into a radical religious compound in eastern Oklahoma, into a neo-Nazi bank robbery gang, some of whose members later accused others of involvement in the bombing, and into Louis Beam, at the time the chief propagandist of the anti-government right, who was reported to have said in 1994 that \"some kid\" was going to blow up a building in Denver, Dallas, or Oklahoma City in revenge for Waco.\nThe justice department's fear was that following one or more of these leads and pointing to a wider conspiracy would weaken the case against McVeigh, when the directive from above was to obtain the death penalty at all costs. \"At some point,\" Napolitano acknowledged, \"a strategic decision was made to focus and get a clean straightforward case against McVeigh, and not pursue every rabbit down its hole.\"\nAnd so the wider story - of a heartland America desperate and cynical about its government, of a small but growing minority willing to embrace the notion that one day it might have to take up arms against tyranny in Washington - went largely untold. In 2025, we know at last how important that story was, and where it was destined to lead.\nAndrew Gumbel is the author of Oklahoma City: What The Investigation Missed - And Why It Still Matters (William Morrow, 2012)",

      "content": "Recent research suggests our brain power is in decline. Is offloading our cognitive work to AI driving this trend?\nImagine for a moment you are a child in 1941, sitting the common entrance exam for public schools with nothing but a pencil and paper. You read the following: \"Write, for no more than a quarter of an hour, about a British author.\"\nToday, most of us wouldn't need 15 minutes to ponder such a question. We'd get the answer instantly by turning to AI tools such as Google Gemini, ChatGPT or Siri. Offloading cognitive effort to artificial intelligence has become second nature, but with mounting evidence that human intelligence is declining, some experts fear this impulse is driving the trend.\nOf course, this isn't the first time that new technology has raised concerns. Studies already show how mobile phones distract us, social media damages our fragile attention spans and GPS has rendered our navigational abilities obsolete. Now, here comes an AI co-pilot to relieve us of our most cognitively demanding tasks - from handling tax returns to providing therapy and even telling us how to think.\nWhere does that leave our brains? Free to engage in more substantive pursuits or wither on the vine as we outsource our thinking to faceless algorithms?\n\"The greatest worry in these times of generative AI is not that it may compromise human creativity or intelligence,\" says psychologist Robert Sternberg at Cornell University, who is known for his groundbreaking work on intelligence, \"but that it already has.\"\nThe argument that we are becoming less intelligent draws from several studies. Some of the most compelling are those that examine the Flynn effect - the observed increase in IQ over successive generations throughout the world since at least 1930, attributed to environmental factors rather than genetic changes. But in recent decades, the Flynn effect has slowed or even reversed.\nIn the UK, James Flynn himself showed that the average IQ of a 14-year-old dropped by more than two points between 1980 and 2008. Meanwhile, global study the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) shows an unprecedented drop in maths, reading and science scores across many regions, with young people also showing poorer attention spans and weaker critical thinking.\nNevertheless, while these trends are empirical and statistically robust, their interpretations are anything but. \"Everyone wants to point the finger at AI as the boogeyman, but that should be avoided,\" says Elizabeth Dworak, at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, who recently identified hints of a reversal of the Flynn effect in a large sample of the US population tested between 2006 and 2018.\nIntelligence is far more complicated than that, and probably shaped by many variables - micronutrients such as iodine are known to affect brain development and intellectual abilities, likewise changes in prenatal care, number of years in education, pollution, pandemics and technology all influence IQ, making it difficult to isolate the impact of a single factor. \"We don't act in a vacuum, and we can't point to one thing and say, 'That's it,'\" says Dworak.\nStill, while AI's impact on overall intelligence is challenging to quantify (at least in the short term), concerns about cognitive offloading diminishing specific cognitive skills are valid - and measurable.\nWhen considering AI's impact on our brains, most studies focus on generative AI (GenAI) - the tool that has allowed us to offload more cognitive effort than ever before. Anyone who owns a phone or a computer can access almost any answer, write any essay or computer code, produce art or photography - all in an instant. There have been thousands of articles written about the many ways in which GenAI has the potential to improve our lives, through increased revenues, job satisfaction and scientific progress, to name a few. In 2023, Goldman Sachs estimated that GenAI could boost annual global GDP by 7% over a 10-year period - an increase of roughly $7tn.\nThe fear comes, however, from the fact that automating these tasks deprives us of the opportunity to practise those skills ourselves, weakening the neural architecture that supports them. Just as neglecting our physical workouts leads to muscle deterioration, outsourcing cognitive effort atrophies neural pathways.\nOne of our most vital cognitive skills at risk is critical thinking. Why consider what you admire about a British author when you can get ChatGPT to reflect on that for you?\nResearch underscores these concerns. Michael Gerlich at SBS Swiss Business School in Kloten, Switzerland, tested 666 people in the UK and found a significant correlation between frequent AI use and lower critical-thinking skills - with younger participants who showed higher dependence on AI tools scoring lower in critical thinking compared with older adults.\nSimilarly, a study by researchers at Microsoft and Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania surveyed 319 people in professions that use GenAI at least once a week. While it improved their efficiency, it also inhibited critical thinking and fostered long-term overreliance on the technology, which the researchers predict could result in a diminished ability to solve problems without AI support.\n\"It's great to have all this information at my fingertips,\" said one participant in Gerlich's study, \"but I sometimes worry that I'm not really learning or retaining anything. I rely so much on AI that I don't think I'd know how to solve certain problems without it.\" Indeed, other studies have suggested that the use of AI systems for memory-related tasks may lead to a decline in an individual's own memory capacity.\nThis erosion of critical thinking is compounded by the AI-driven algorithms that dictate what we see on social media. \"The impact of social media on critical thinking is enormous,\" says Gerlich. \"To get your video seen, you have four seconds to capture someone's attention.\" The result? A flood of bite-size messages that are easily digested but don't encourage critical thinking. \"It gives you information that you don't have to process any further,\" says Gerlich.\nBy being served information rather than acquiring that knowledge through cognitive effort, the ability to critically analyse the meaning, impact, ethics and accuracy of what you have learned is easily neglected in the wake of what appears to be a quick and perfect answer. \"To be critical of AI is difficult - you have to be disciplined. It is very challenging not to offload your critical thinking to these machines,\" says Gerlich.\nWendy Johnson, who studies intelligence at Edinburgh University, sees this in her students every day. She emphasises that it is not something she has tested empirically but believes that students are too ready to substitute independent thinking with letting the internet tell them what to do and believe.\nWithout critical thinking, it is difficult to ensure that we consume AI-generated content wisely. It may appear credible, particularly as you become more dependent on it, but don't be fooled. A 2023 study in Science Advances showed that, compared with humans, GPT-3 chat not only produces information that is easier to understand but also more compelling disinformation.\nWhy does that matter? \"Think of a hypothetical billionaire,\" says Gerlich. \"They create their own AI and they use that to influence people because they can train it in a specific way to emphasise certain politics or certain opinions. If there is trust and dependency on it, the question arises of how much it is influencing our thoughts and actions.\"\nAI's effect on creativity is equally disconcerting. Studies show that AI tends to help individuals produce more creative ideas than they can generate alone. However, across the whole population, AI-concocted ideas are less diverse, which ultimately means fewer \"Eureka!\" moments.\nSternberg captures these concerns in a recent essay in the Journal of Intelligence: \"Generative AI is replicative. It can recombine and re-sort ideas, but it is not clear that it will generate the kinds of paradigm-breaking ideas the world needs to solve the serious problems that confront it, such as global climate change, pollution, violence, increasing income disparities, and creeping autocracy.\"\nTo ensure that you maintain your ability to think creatively, you might want to consider how you engage with AI - actively or passively. Research by Marko Muller from the University of Ulm in Germany shows a link between social media use and higher creativity in younger people but not in older generations. Digging into the data, he suggests this may be to do with the difference in how people who were born in the era of social media use it compared with those who came to it later in life. Younger people seem to benefit creatively from idea-sharing and collaboration, says Muller, perhaps because they're more open with what they share online compared with older users, who tend to consume it more passively.\nAlongside what happens while you use AI, you might spare a thought to what happens after you use it. Cognitive neuroscientist John Kounios from Drexel University in Philadelphia explains that, just like anything else that is pleasurable, our brain gets a buzz from having a sudden moment of insight, fuelled by activity in our neural reward systems. These mental rewards help us remember our world-changing ideas and also modify our immediate behaviour, making us less risk averse - this is all thought to drive further learning, creativity and opportunities. But insights generated from AI don't seem to have such a powerful effect in the brain. \"The reward system is an extremely important part of brain development, and we just don't know what the effect of using these technologies will have downstream,\" says Kounios. \"Nobody's tested that yet.\"\nThere are other long-term implications to consider. Researchers have only recently discovered that learning a second language, for instance, helps delay the onset of dementia for around four years, yet in many countries, fewer students are applying for language courses. Giving up a second language in favour of AI-powered instant-translation apps might be the reason, but none of these can - so far - claim to protect your future brain health.\nAs Sternberg warns, we need to stop asking what AI can do for us and start asking what it is doing to us. Until we know for sure, the answer, according to Gerlich, is to \"train humans to be more human again - using critical thinking, intuition - the things that computers can't yet do and where we can add real value.\"\nWe can't expect the big tech companies to help us do this, he says. No developer wants to be told their program works too well; makes it too easy for a person to find an answer. \"So it needs to start in schools,\" says Gerlich. \"AI is here to stay. We have to interact with it, so we need to learn how to do that in the right way.\" If we don't, we won't just make ourselves redundant, but our cognitive abilities too.",

      "content": "More and more men are being sucked into parts of the internet that circulate misogynist content, leaving their families to deal with the wreckage\nSamantha thought of her partner as the most progressive man she had ever had a relationship with. Her Swedish boyfriend seemed, to her, more feminist than many British men she had dated.\n\"I never had to ask him to clear up,\" she says. \"All our labour was shared. He had done therapy. He was happy to talk about his emotions.\"\nWhen they broke up, however, Samantha, who is in her 30s and based in Sheffield, saw a very different side to him. She recalls going to his flat to collect her belongings. \"I got into a debate with him,\" she says. \"It became clear his beliefs had become centred around the idea that men are more sexual than women, and men and women can't be friends.\n\"He said: 'Now we are not together, I don't need to agree with everything you say.'\"\nHe told her he had become involved during the pandemic in what he described as a men's mental health group. Samantha has since discovered the group was influenced by Canadian psychologist Jordan Peterson, who has expressed controversial views about women, and a far-right Swedish influencer whom her ex-boyfriend had appeared with in photos on social media. \"It's that strand of the manosphere that is focused on self-help and spirituality,\" she says. \"The whole time we were together, there were no warning signs.\"\nSamantha's experience is not an isolated case. Several women told the Observer their partners had been sucked into the manosphere - the name given to parts of the internet that circulate misogynist content - or consumed far-right material online.\nWith surveys reporting that an increasing number of young men are subscribing to these beliefs, the number of women finding that their partners share the misogynistic views espoused by the likes of Andrew Tate is also on the rise. Research from anti-fascism organisation Hope Not Hate, which polled about 2,000 people across the UK aged 16 to 24, discovered that 41% of young men support Tate versus just 12% of young women.\n\"Numbers are growing, with wives worried about their husbands and partners becoming radicalised,\" says Nigel Bromage, a reformed neo-Nazi who is now the director of Exit Hate Trust, a charity that helps people who want to leave the far right.\n\"Wives or partners become really worried about the impact on their family, especially those with young children, as they fear they will be influenced by extremism and racism.\"\nHis organisation supports women whose loved ones become involved in the manosphere or the far right, as well as the individuals themselves.\nBromage, who was involved in far-right groups for two decades, warns that the charity is seeing a \"crossover\" between those involved in the manosphere and the wider far right.\n\"Over the last few years, the rhetoric of the manosphere has increasingly leaked out of isolated forums on to mainstream platforms,\" says Anki Deo, Hope Not Hate's senior policy officer. \"It has been taken up by influencers with a much wider audience and is no longer just a 'dark corner of the internet'.\"\nRachel, who is in her 30s and lives in London, met her partner on the popular dating app Hinge, and was struck by his generosity. He insisted on buying her gifts and giving her cash to spend. She thought her now ex-partner was a \"normal, decent guy\". But as the relationship progressed, she began to feel uneasy as he forced more gifts on her. Four months into the relationship, she began to realise his political views were profoundly different from her own.\n\"I was talking about the gay community. He got aggressive with me,\" Rachel recalls. \"He was super homophobic - I didn't know until then.\"\nA few days later, he interrupted an argument to show her a video of Tate. \"I don't think Tate fuelled him,\" Rachel says. \"He was always like that, but it validated his beliefs. He really liked the flashy lifestyle. He just had a lot of hatred.\"\nHe became more controlling as the relationship unfolded, she recalls, complaining that she had male friends and a career. He argued that she shouldn't be focused on work because it was his duty to provide for her.\nThe relationship ended after six months. His behaviour had escalated to the point where he raped and assaulted her, and was convicted of both offences after they broke up.\nDr Lisa Sugiura, associate professor in cybercrime and gender at the University of Portsmouth, who specialises in online misogyny, says that although there is widespread concern about men being radicalised by the manosphere, there is not enough focus on the \"really concerning\" risk these individuals pose to their female partners.\nCommonly held views in the manosphere, says Sugiura, include being anti-feminist, thinking that misandry is equivalent to misogyny and believing society is systemically sexist against men. \"They want to go back to this time where women had no rights in society at all and were completely owned by their father and then their husband.\"\nDebbie, who is in her 50s, says her ex-husband's \"mask started to slip\" after they moved in together. \"When I got a good job and started earning more money, passed my driving test and became more independent, that was when he started watching far-right and misogynistic content online,\" she says.\nHer husband was an avid fan of a YouTuber known for his misogynistic and Islamophobic views, and also consumed content from Christian militia groups, Debbie says.\n\"He put crucifixes all over the back of his van. The reason I knew what content he was viewing was because he would proudly talk about it in front of our kids.\"\nShe says he told her that he hated feminists and the women's liberation movement. Debbie also says he was violent towards her.\nRoisin, from Belfast, says that after she broke up with her partner, he began subscribing to increasingly extreme views. She shares a daughter with him and says he has shown her manosphere videos and told her that she can't leave the house in certain clothes.\n\"He has made derogatory remarks about other races and cultures in front of her,\" Roisin adds. \"And said: 'If you ever got pregnant, I wouldn't allow you to get an abortion.'\"\nSugiura says that female partners of men sucked into the manosphere are being neglected by society. \"I don't think anybody is thinking about the impact on them. There is concern for these people who are being indoctrinated or radicalised by these harmful ideologies, but what is the risk to those in relationships with them?\n\"We need to ensure their voices and experiences are not forgotten.\"\nNames have been changed to protect identities",
      "ml_hf_summary": "This article discusses the growing trend of men becoming involved in misogynistic online communities known as the \"manosphere,\" leading to negative impacts on their female partners.

But as I wasn't planning to visit America, this doesn't feel like a sacrifice, let alone a meaningful one. So the appearance of the #BoycottUSA movement has arrived at just the right time. Here is a campaign I can sign up to wholeheartedly. But I plan to go further than the one in three French people who are merely \"avoiding\" American products. Instead, I am proposing a total purge, ridding my house and my life of any taint of Americana. Not a Marlboro will be smoked, no Manhattan drunk, no foot stomped to the exuberant refrain of Cotton Eye Joe.\nThese are, of course, mere gestures. Eschewing Marlboros and line-dancing is no sacrifice at all, though turning down a perfect Manhattan will be tough. I know that if I am going to be serious about de-Americanising everything, I have to get systematic about it. There will need to be research and auditing, rules and considerations and caveats and, above all, self-control, commitment and discipline.\nSo, to keep myself on this righteous path and to help others similarly appalled by America's descent into authoritarian plutocracy cleanse their lives of Yankee fare, I offer the rules of the game and an incomplete review of everything that I will be replacing with unAmerican alternatives.\n1 No American product may be bought or American service used. No exceptions. (But what about Apple, I hear you say. They have rejected calls to remove DEI policies! What about Patagonia? They are the good guys! Yes, and yes, of course some American companies - and some Americans - are good. But \"whataboutery\" won't get us anywhere.)\n2 If an American product has been previously bought, it can be used until it breaks, at which point it cannot be replaced by another American product. (Note: if a working product, eg an iPhone, uses American services, eg iCloud storage, it must be immediately replaced by a product that does not require American services to work.) Similarly, one is allowed to keep any existing American friends, but making new American friends is verboten.\n3 If an artist (a writer, musician, film-maker, actor, whatever) is American, their work is taboo. It is acceptable to experience American art on existing physical formats but, as per Rule 2, these cannot be replaced once defunct. (To support American artists is to support the American Military-Media-Entertainment Complex. Sorry, Bruce.)\n4 It's not a principle if it doesn't cost you something.\nSo, now that we are clear about the rules, it's time to apply them, starting with the trickiest area of all: technology. You might imagine me to be a typical metropolitan media douche, swanning around coffee shops with my bestickered MacBook Air while using my Apple Watch to pay for my PS4.30 flat whites. In fact, nothing could be further from the truth. I actually swan around coffee shops with an unstickered Google Chromebook and I use a Garmin running watch to pay for my PS4.50 pour over, thank you very much.\nBut whether you are an Apple fanatic or a Google diehard, replacing hardware and software is going to be painful, costly and complicated, and will involve unfamiliar systems with steep learning curves. It is possible to replace US hardware with Chinese or Taiwanese equivalents but as these come with their own moral issues, I've forced myself to look for European devices, which makes for a harder, but more self-congratulatory journey. Just imagine how smug it will feel to have mastered a whole new operating system on a European laptop and to send an inaugural text message on a sustainable European phone!\nSo, I will be replacing my Google Pixelbook Go with a German Tuxedo InfinityBook Pro 14 running its own version of the Linux (developed at the University of Helsinki) operating system. My Google Pixel 8a Android phone is going to be swapped out with a Franco-Dutch Murena Fairphone 5 running the \"deGoogled\" /e/OS and my American Garmin will be replaced by a Finnish Suunto watch.\nBut even avoiding US tech brands does not guarantee that a phone or laptop will be completely unAmerican. Fairphone uses soldering paste made out of recycled tin (good!) made for them by Connecticut-based MacDermid Alpha (bad!). And their phone chips are made in Asia by US-based Qualcomm. Tuxedo does not specify where its components come from, though it says that the vast majority are made in Asia and imported to Germany where its laptops are assembled. Surprisingly, it turns out that phones and laptops are complex devices with many, many, many components and also the global supply chain is very complicated indeed. Don't lift the rock if you're squeamish about what you might find underneath.\nWith hardware mostly sorted, it's time to get familiar with open source software, as I won't be able to use the vast majority of apps that come with Apple or Android devices. No more Gmail, Google Maps or Apple Photos. Instead, I'll be switching to Proton Mail (based in Switzerland, home of lots of privacy-focused apps), OpenStreetMap (or UK-based Citymapper for urbanites) and Immich, a photo library that I'll be hosting myself instead of paying Apple or Google for the privilege. Video calling with Zoom and Google Meet can be supplanted by Norwegian Whereby, while word processing, spreadsheets and presentations will all be handled by LibreOffice, part of the non-profit Berlin-based Document Foundation. Au revoir Microsoft Teams, you will not be missed.\nAs anyone who has tried to switch from Android to iPhone or Mac to PC knows, familiarity is a major barrier to change. Abandoning tools and services I've used for years (decades, in the case of Gmail) and learning new systems, new terminology and new shortcuts is tedious, expensive and frustrating. I've always thought of myself as \"good at the internet\", but trying to work out how to get public transport directions in OpenStreetMap or make a LibreOffice document look as if it has been designed by somebody with working eyes is making me feel tired and old.\nWhen it comes to social media, things get really tricky. I obviously deleted my X/Twitter account long ago but, according to Rule 1, I will have to delete my Bluesky profile and turn to its nerdier cousin Mastodon. Hey, at least I won't stumble across Piers Morgan there. And a smaller, less shouty social network that doesn't demand much attention reduces the risk of making any new American friends or contacts (Rule 2). I'm sure there are plenty of good, well-meaning Americans out there sharing good and interesting insights, reckonings, gifs and feelings, so please don't think I'm being rude if I block, mute or ignore you until 2028. I'm just following the rules.\nYouTube is, I fear, fairly irreplaceable. I could up my TikTok usage (it's Chinese-owned) but as the point of this whole exercise is to make me a better person, will that really work? I've tried Dailymotion (the French YouTube) and it simply doesn't scratch that itch. There's just so much less of it. If your hope is that a French YouTube will be infused with subtle yet sophisticated Gallic charm, then I am going to have to disappoint you.\nNetflix, Apple TV+, Disney+ and Prime Video will all have to go. Arrivederci The Studio, Reacher and Slow Horses. Hasta luego Seinfeld repeats, Breaking Bad binges and The Good Place water cooler moments. But thankfully we still have the Great British Broadcasting Corporation and its tip-top iPlayer service. I haven't watched EastEnders since the early 1990s. I'll bet there's been plenty going on in Albert Square for me to catch up on.\nSign up to Inside Saturday\nThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine. Sign up to get the inside story from our top writers as well as all the must-read articles and columns, delivered to your inbox every weekend.\nafter newsletter promotion\nAnd for music I have Spotify, which is Swedish, so already not American. But remember, no streaming of American music - we don't want royalties falling into the wrong hands. On Spotify you can block artists so they don't appear in your recommendations. Setting up this block list will be the cultural self-flagellation that demonstrates total devotion to the cause. Never again will I groove around the kitchen to Marvin, Aretha or Otis. Johnny Cash, Willie Nelson, Emmylou Harris, time to saddle up and ride into the sunset. No, Alexa, do not play Not Like Us by Kendrick Lamar from Spotify. This one's going to hurt.\nAnd then there's Amazon. Finding alternatives to \"the world's most customer-centric company\" is a non-negotiable. While Waterstones has a US investment group as its majority shareholder, there are plenty of other places that will post a book to you including uk.bookshop.org, which gives a significant proportion of its profits to local independent booksellers. Non-book items will require more shopping around, more patience and will probably come at a higher cost, but at least I'll be sleeping with a clear conscience while I wait.\nNext up is a room-by-room property inspection to see where further American invaders can be eradicated. The kitchen is a battlefield as a small number of giant US food conglomerates own a great many European brands, all of which must now be purged from fridges and cupboards. Is there anything more English than Gary Lineker flogging a salt and vinegar crisp? Think again, for Walkers is owned by Frito-Lay, itself owned by PepsiCo. No Wotsit, Quaver, Frazzle or Monster Munch (sob!) shall pass my lips again.\nThe list of prohibited foods is lengthy and surprising, and it will be necessary to get familiar with all the brands owned and managed by Kraft Heinz, General Mills and Mondelez to ensure that no proscribed product accidentally gets into the shopping trolley. It's going to be easiest to print out a list of these products (only a dozen or so pages in 9pt type) to take to the supermarket on every shop. And printouts have the benefit of being able to be waved aggressively at anyone I spot reaching for the Alvalle Gazpacho (made in Spain, owned by PepsiCo) in Waitrose.\nIn the cupboard under the sink and in the bathroom, I thought it would simply be a question of replacing anything from Procter & Gamble with the equivalent item from Anglo-Dutch Unilever. Begone Ariel, Oral B and Olay. Wilkommen Persil, Signal and Dove. But as Unilever owns a huge number of US brands, again it becomes a question of a forensic inspection of the labels and an encyclopedic knowledge of American corporate hierarchies. I might have to follow the example of my French mother-in-law who makes her own washing liquid by blending Savon de Marseille, warm water and bicarbonate of soda. I don't think this is a political gesture, though with the French you can never be sure. For my part, I will be washing only in the finest Eau de Thames Water followed by a quick spritz of Unilever-owned Brut.\nAs someone who hasn't worn a pair of Levi's since Nick Kamen left the scene, a boycott of American clothing is barely a challenge. According to Rule 2, I can wear my Converse All Stars until they fall apart, at which point they will be replaced by German Pumas or Italian Diadoras. Zara (Spanish) and Uniqlo (Japanese) will dress me from head to toe, though strangely most men's underpants brands do seem to be American. Thank God for Marks & Spencer.\nThen, just as I light a Gauloise to celebrate the complete decontamination of my life, I come across three issues that make me let out a Homer Simpson-esque \"Doh!\" in frustration. First, it is not possible to find a bank that doesn't use either Visa or Mastercard to process payments and every time a payment is processed, one of these two US businesses gets a cut. Stockholm-based Klarna might be a non-US option for some online payments and there is talk of the European Central Bank issuing \"digital euros\" later this decade, but I doubt I'll be able to take advantage of it here in Brexity Blighty. So, short of keeping wads of notes stashed in the mattress and shopping only in stores that still take cash, there doesn't seem any practical way of deAmericanising this particular aspect of modern life.\nAnd in further fiscal frustration, if your pension plan is anything like mine, it is likely to hold a mixture of investments including UK, European and US stocks. I asked the very sensible person who administers my pension whether I could get rid of my US investments and was told it is possible, \"although probably rather unwise as divesting completely from US holdings reduces geographic diversification, which could impact risk-adjusted returns\". I suspect in this context \"rather unwise\" actually means \"Does this idiot even understand how money works?\" Call me a coward, but incurring the wrath of my wife by jeopardising her future financial security is too great a risk for me to contemplate.\nAnd then I was reminded of something that has made me doubt whether I can do any of this at all. Because Arsenal - the football team I support and read about and think about and care about a little too much - are, like nine other Premier League clubs, American-owned. And not just any American, but shopping mall developer, married-to-Walmart-heiress all-American American. Dang! Even if the nearest British-owned team were not our hated rivals Tottenham, I just can't switch allegiance. I'm going to have to give up football itself. But not now, not yet, not with the excitement of a European quarter-final so fresh in the memory. Sorry.\nSo, yeah, I'm keeping my bank account, my pension, my football team (for now) and, I hope, my marriage. This exercise is not about rejecting the modern world or the pleasures and comforts of modern life. It's about turning away from America and turning towards Europe. One day I'd love to go back to the States and eat a cheeseburger in a Brooklyn dive bar, toasting old friends and new with shots of rail bourbon in the Land of the Free. But not for the time being, not under the current regime.\nSo pour me a Rob Roy, give me a packet of Marmite-flavoured peanuts and sit me down in front of Antiques Roadshow, I'll be grand. Up on the moral high ground life is sweet, if a little lonely. See, my family refuse to close their WhatsApp accounts and join me on Telegram and I think they might be talking about me behind my back. I get lost all the time and no one is liking or sharing the photos I post to Pixelfed. And I really miss my friends and our group chats, miss the videos and in-jokes and playlists we share, the things that have nourished our relationships over the years.\nBut it's OK. It's not a principle if it doesn't cost you something.",
      "ml_hf_summary": "This is a fascinating piece! It's a humorous yet insightful look at the author's attempt to de-Americanize their life, and the challenges that come with it. \n\nHere are some of the things I found particularly interesting:\n\n**Humor & Relatability:** The author uses humor effectively to highlight the absurdity of the situation.  The \"Homer Simpson\" moment about Arsenal being American-owned is a great example. It's relatable for anyone who has ever felt like they were living in a world where everything was controlled by American corporations. \n\n**Personal Journey & Reflection:** The piece goes beyond just listing rules and regulations. It delves into the author's personal journey, their motivations, and their anxieties about making this change.  We see them grappling with financial decisions, social connections, and even their love for football. This makes the story more engaging and human.\n\n**Cultural Commentary:** The piece subtly critiques American cultural dominance in various aspects of life (finance, media, sports). It's a reflection on how globalization has impacted our lives and choices. \n\n**Open-ended Ending:**  The ending leaves room for interpretation. Is the author truly committed to this change? Will they eventually embrace some aspects of American culture again? This ambiguity adds depth and intrigue to the piece.\n\n\nOverall, this is a well-written and thought-provoking piece that offers a unique perspective on de-Americanization in the modern world. It's a story about personal choices, cultural identity, and finding your own path in a globalized world. \n"

      "content": "The comic, her brother and her mum and dad on a nomadic childhood, not doing a PhD in spaghetti westerns, and taking the plunge as an actor\nBorn in Hong Kong in 1970, Sally Phillips is a comedian, writer and actor. After graduating with a first-class degree in Italian and linguistics at Oxford University, she began working as an actor. In 1997 she was cast in I'm Alan Partridge, and two years later she co-wrote and starred in sketch comedy Smack the Pony, followed by roles in Big Train, Veep, Miranda and the Bridget Jones franchise. She has three children and currently lives between London and Australia. Sally stars in new comedy drama Austin on BBC One on Fridays.\nMy mum, dad, brother and I are outside our house in Hong Kong. Andrew and I are both in knitted ponchos, which I'm certain my mother was responsible for. My dad worked for British Airways, so we moved around a lot. If you have that kind of nomadic upbringing, you are naturally an outsider wherever you go. I spent a lot of my childhood observing, mainly the things that were funny and strange.\nOur parents were quite tough on us growing up. My mother especially. She would claim her toughness is because of her Yorkshire roots, but I've been to Yorkshire and met lots of soft people. She would say: \"Well-behaved women rarely make history.\" I wasn't allowed a Barbie and instead had an Action Girl with a jumpsuit and ginger hair. Mum nurtured us in subtle ways; the house was filled with costumes and art supplies.\nWhen it comes to being funny, I believe there are two types of brains: one is a satirist who is good with words; the other is an idiot who walks into the wall. I was the latter; Andrew the former. He had a joke about a bulldozer that my mother still goes on about.\nAt first I wanted to be the kind of actress who plays Juliet at the RSC, but it turns out there's something about me that stops people taking me seriously. That was quite devastating for a while. At university I co-wrote a one-woman show - Benedetta, the Life of a Lesbian Nun in Renaissance Italy - based on the true story of Benedetta Carlini. It was a big, serious endeavour: an hour and a half of me doing 50 different characters, lots of accents and a significant amount of mime. My parents, unfortunately, found it hilarious.\nWhen I graduated, they hoped I might work for Shell or Olivetti. Instead, I considered doing a PhD on the spaghetti western, which was not met with much approval. I then decided I would go to clown school, which they were also strongly opposed to. But I started to get work, and gradually the feedback evolved from \"What a ridiculous idea\" to \"Well done\".\nI realised if you could push against your parents' disapproval, you probably had the determination to work in this profession, as it can be quite a bruising industry. Even though I've been doing it for decades, it still is. Some doors I open and everyone goes, \"You're a genius!\", and behind another they'll say, \"You're so yesterday. You're so old and fat and exactly not what we're looking for.\"\nWhen my son Olly was born with Down's syndrome, I moved closer to my parents, and they created a kind of crisis encampment. Dad said: \"We're going to operate a visa system, and you get to decide who is allowed into the flat and who isn't.\" It was incredible, especially as my marriage didn't work out. Olly knows he can ring his uncle at any hour, day or night, and he'll answer, and probably take him to the pub.\nThere are probably families that are closer than ours - we do have a strong vein of eating crisps in different rooms while watching different TV shows - but I have totally lucked out. I don't think I could have managed the hand I've been dealt without my family's support.\nWas Sally funny as a child? I always thought she laughed too much at her own jokes. But we got on. While I can't recall fighting much, we certainly would have clashed. Take our approach to Easter eggs. I was in the \"eat them all in one go\" category. She was in the \"save it and have a little bit at a time\" category. Naturally, when mine was finished, I'd go after hers.\nWhen Smack the Pony was on billboards around London, I'd think: \"Jesus, that's my sister.\" It was bizarre but then you get used to it. Although I do still find myself getting mildly freaked out if I hear her voice on TV.\nSally is a very supportive big sister. Very pro-family, very into keeping people together. She stays in touch with relatives who I can't even recall how I'm related to, and she does a Sunday roast for everyone whenever she can. All of which is quite amazing, especially bearing in mind how busy she generally is.\nSally is genuine, she's helpful and she can be hilarious. Not all the time. But sometimes.\nSign up to Inside Saturday\nThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

One day we had a 5ft snake in it.\nShortly after this was taken, I had a succession of postings: Zambia, Brunei, Lebanon, London, the Gulf, Australia, Italy, then back to London. It was a very interesting childhood for Sally, experiencing the different cultures.\nLike most daddies would say about their daughters, Sally was absolutely delightful. Very smiley and so bright. You would read her a story and a week later she would remember the words. When we were in Bahrain, an opera singer came to our house. She overheard Sally singing, and said she had perfect pitch.\nWhen Sally finished at Oxford with a first, I was so proud of her. I asked her what she was going to do next, and she said: \"I'm going to be an actress.\" I said: \"Don't be so ridiculous. You'll be unemployed 99% of the time.\" She replied: \"Somebody's got to succeed. Why not me?\" She put me back in my box, and I was so impressed.\nSince then she has had the pressure of being a working mother and managing Olly, but people rally around her because she is such a great friend to them. It hasn't been easy. But, like anyone who has met Sally will tell you, she's always good news.\nSally was absolutely beautiful when she was born. Actually, I take that back. Initially she had a big bump on her head as they pulled her out of me with a suction device. But in the end she was all right.\nSally was very good at keeping her brothers in order. She's the eldest of three. She was also excellent at occupying herself, making up games and putting on plays.\nWhen Smack the Pony came out there were massive posters of the cast everywhere. It was lovely to see Sally get the credit she deserved. What I admired most was their approach to humour - it was for women, making fun of women. We hadn't seen that before on television.\nSally is perceptive and has good taste. Are we similar? Well, I wouldn't think so. She's much better.",

      "content": "Grand Designs team to make show set in wealthy English countryside that promises to be part glittering social whirl and part bloodbath \nThe Cotswolds had better steel itself: reality television is upon it. A series is planned (rumoured working title: Ladies of the Cotswolds) and it sounds posher than most. It's made by the company behind Grand Designs and set in the \"chocolate box\" town of Charlbury, in the Evenlode valley.\nNames are being proposed for the series, such as Gabriela Peacock (nutritionist entrepreneur married to hedge fund banker David Peacock, and pals with Joan Collins and Princess Beatrice). Plum Sykes (author of last year's Cotswolds-set novel Wives Like Us) is thought to be scripting the voiceover. Then there's \"Suzie Jet\" (Suzannah Harvey), CEO of the local airport. How marvellously down to earth and relatable they all sound. Though of course they don't, and that's the point.\nThere's a semi-antecedent to Ladies of the Cotswolds - Ladies of London, which aired from 2014 to 2017 on Bravo. There's also the reality juggernaut Made in Chelsea, though that's pitched younger. The rural element of this latest toff-reality cultural fusion seems to link the success of the 2024 Disney+ adaptation of Jilly Cooper's Rivals with the ongoing Brit obsession with the generationally wealthy.\nThus, the Cotswolds is ideal: running through counties including Oxfordshire, Gloucestershire, Warwickshire, Worcestershire and Wiltshire, it's Posh Central, anddubbed the \"Hamptons of the UK\". It is chocka with salubrious hangouts: Soho Farmhouse; Estelle Manor; The Bull, in Charlbury; The Pig in the Cotswolds. Celebrity locals include Kate Moss; the Beckhams; and Claudia Winkleman. The Chipping Norton set: Jeremy Clarkson, the Camerons, Blur's Alex James; Rebekah Brooks. Taylor Swift is thought to have stayed near Great Tew when she was performing on the UK leg of her Eras tour. Now, Beyonce and Jay-Z are said to be contemplating buying a property in the Cotswolds area.\nIn this way, the series ties in less with old money, rolling hills and stately piles and more with toff influencers pushing lifestyle aspiration on social media. Which makes the Cotswolds less a region, rather an uber-gentrified brand redolent of honey-hued cottages, ice baths and welly-boot scrapers. In what may be a deal breaker for many, it's apparently difficult to secure housekeepers and grooms.\nIn more prosaic terms, there are problems with overtourism and locals being priced out of the area. Still, one can only read, enviously rapt, about the freshwater swimming pools, organic farm shops, multiple kitchens and stables with Range Rovers. The very best that rural England (stealth wealth division) has to offer.\nAll of which makes it strange to hear that Ladies is inspired by The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills and the extended Real Housewives global franchise. In the UK, there's The Real Housewives of Cheshire, while The Real Housewives of London is mooted. Real Housewives content tends to have three main components: grooming, gossip and drama. Cast members are required to, shall we say, speak their truth. Add hair extensions, shellac nails and almost daily gown-fittings and it's part glittering social whirl, part bloodbath.\nHow would this brand of \"reality\" land in the Cotswolds, where the properly wealthy don't require the cash, and the famously private don't need the exposure? An area where high-flying financiers don't want their lives turned into reputational rubble, and landowners wouldn't know a Molly-Mae Hague from an irrigation trench in the fallow field. Even now, there are reports of Cotswold establishments being disinclined to give Ladies permission to film on their premises. In terms of Cotswolds sensibilities and etiquette, would appearing on reality TV be considered a faux pas?\nRupert Wesson is director of Debrett's, the authority on traditions, society and culture. \"People who are very wealthy don't feel the need to expose themselves,\" he says, but \"nowadays the barriers for what is filmed for media channels and what is filmed for TV are blurring\". Wesson lives in the Cotswolds and points out it already has a prominent reality TV show, Prime Video's Clarkson's Farm. Also, that aristocrats have sometimes allowed cameras to film their estates and themselves, often to help finance the astronomical upkeep.\nWouldn't wealthy Cotswolds types consider appearing on reality TV naff? \"They'd just see it as unnecessary,\" Wesson says, adding that Debrett's wouldn't take a view. \"We tend not to opine on this sort of thing.\" Would such an area produce reality-style material? \"There are plenty of people who want to be on TV and are prepared to sign up to what I think the professionals call heightened reality. Most people will know it isn't real life - it's just a curated version. Still they buy into it. I'm sure it will look beautiful. I'm sure the people on it will look beautiful. That in itself is enough to draw people in.\"\nPlaying into all this is the ever-shifting nature of reality TV itself, and the ongoing censure of it. Its content (augmented; premeditated; soft-scripted) has long been disparaged as the enemy of creativity. In 2014, Gary Oldman called it \"the museum of social decay\", adding of the Kardashians: \"My dog has more dignity than those fuckers.\"\nIt perhaps says something that, bar Made in Chelsea and the odd aristo-participant (Lady Colin Campbell; Lord Brocket) in I'm a Celebrity ... , drama rather than reality is where our longstanding fascination (and scorn, and sometimes affection) for the rich and privileged has played out: historically (Brideshead Revisited) and more recently in Succession; The White Lotus; and Rivals. Are wealthy people less likely to play the reality TV game because, frankly, they don't need to? Is this going to be a problem for Ladies of the Cotswolds?\nAs Netflix's With Love, Meghan lifestyle-love-in demonstrated, there can be only so much enthralment watching wealthy sorts collecting honey from photogenic hives, or sprinkling flowers on food. In cynical Britain, there's only so much aspirational swanking audiences can take, before they cry: \"Where's the dirt?\" And they don't mean scraping good honest Cotswold mud off Le Chameau wellies. At the same time, an era where lifestyle is king, does it matter so long as we all get to peek inside their Aga Rangemasters?",
      "ml_hf_summary": "A new reality TV show called \"Ladies of the Cotswolds\" is being planned by Grand Designs producers and will feature affluent individuals living in the wealthy English countryside. The series aims to capitalize on the popularity of toff-reality shows like \"Made in Chelsea\" and \"The Real Housewives\" franchises, showcasing luxurious lifestyles and aspirational content.  The show's potential success hinges on its ability to capture the unique blend of rural charm and high-society drama that has captivated audiences. The Cotswolds region is known for its affluent residents, celebrity connections, and exclusive amenities, making it an ideal setting for this type of reality TV program. However, challenges include securing filming permits from local establishments and navigating potential backlash from locals who may find the show intrusive or inappropriate. \n"

I was 62, and had been married for 30 years - but it didn't occur to me to say my wife. I knew immediately that the love of my life was Lily, a woman who had left me broken-hearted in my 20s. Lily and I hadn't spoken since the day she left me, in 1982 - and I'd forbidden myself from looking her up online because I was protecting myself from pain. But when I got home from the pub, I decided to take the plunge. I sent Lily a Facebook message. I didn't say, \"I've loved you every day for the last 40 years,\" because I didn't want to seem mad. But truthfully, I had.\nLily replied about 60 seconds after I pressed send, and after that, it was as if the floodgates had opened. Some nights I didn't sleep a wink because I was up until dawn, messaging her. The first time we met in person, it was as if the last four decades just melted away. We spent the night in a hotel, and every touch felt so instinctual. The strangest thing was that I discovered our lives were like mirror images: like me, Lily was married but it was sexless. My wife and I hadn't had sex for 15 years and were living like housemates, and it was the same for Lily and her husband.\nFor the past two years, we have been meeting once a month, but I want more. We've both told our spouses, so our affair is out in the open. My wife has decided to ignore it; her wish is to stay married because it's easier financially and practically. I want to live with Lily and make our relationship official, but she finds the leap into the unknown difficult. I understand that fear of it all going wrong and being left with nothing. If that happens at the age of 25, you pick yourself up, dust yourself down and start again. But at 65, it's much tougher.\nIt's painful, because Lily is all I've ever wanted - she is my favourite thing. To strike out and spend the rest of our lives together would be the most cracking adventure. But I've resigned myself to this, and I can live with it, so long as Lily remains in my life. Once a month will have to be enough - so long as I still get to see her.\nIf you're keen to talk to us about your sex lives you can get in touch by filling in the form below. It is very important that both sexual partners are happy to participate.\nI thought I would experience many loves that were just as intense, but I was wrong\nI should never have dumped Nick. I was young and superficial. I remember thinking his look was a bit uncool and very 70s, and I wanted to embrace the 80s. I thought I'd experience many loves just as intense as what I felt for him, but I was wrong. Since I left Nick, I haven't been able to sustain desire for any man. In my mid-20s, I developed a pattern: six months in, I'd start feeling revolted by the idea of sex with my new boyfriend. I haven't had sex with my husband for 13 years.\nWhen Nick sent that first Facebook message, it was such a thrill. Within days it was clear that we had to get back together. I was nervous about meeting up in the flesh because we have both changed so much. I was a bit shocked by his bald head at first, as I remember him with flowing locks, but he felt just the same. I didn't want him to see my 60-year-old body. I tried to turn off the light in the hotel room, but he wasn't having that. Being in bed with him again was total bliss. I've not had an orgasm during sex since 1982, when we broke up.\nI confessed to my husband early on, and his policy seems to be to pretend the affair doesn't exist. Things have never been very romantic between us. But how do you walk out of a marriage after 32 years? My husband and I are very close. The marriage is passionless but not loveless. I don't want to upset my daughter, who knows nothing about this. She's 30 so it wouldn't devastate her, but I feel overwhelmed by anxiety at the thought of hurting her. It all feels too late. At 64, I have too much fear to abandon the life I have made.\nAnd what if Nick and I don't get on as an official couple? I love him deeply, but sometimes I wonder whether our passion would fade if we lived together. Perhaps my six-month-curse would kick in and I'd stop desiring him. I feel guilty because I know Nick wants more, but I think it's better to continue as we are. That way, we preserve the love we have.",

      "content": "In this extract from her book, Rhiannon Gogh says parents often aren't aware specialist planning is needed if you leave money to a vulnerable dependant\nAs parents to an autistic son, my husband and I found it hard to accept his diagnosis. Developmental milestones were missed, and the difference between Tristan and others became stark. It could not be ignored, denied or explained away - our beautiful son was profoundly autistic.\nTristan was offered a place at a school for children with autism, and every Wednesday morning for a year, I was invited into the school to learn how to interact, play and communicate with our boy. It helped me understand what his future might look like. I could see that he might never talk, work, drive a car or have his own family - he could be dependent on us for the rest of his life.\nNaturally, we would look after him for as long as we could - until, of course, we couldn't. What would happen to our son when we were no longer here? That worry consumed us for years.\nI stumbled upon special needs planning in 2016 when Tristan was six. A chartered financial adviser at the time, I heard the phrase \"disabled person's trusts\" at a networking event, and my ears pricked up. I'd not heard the phrase before.\nI know now that a disabled or vulnerable person's trust is one of the two most common types of trust used to protect and support disabled people. Rather than being given or left to the vulnerable person themselves, money can be held in a trust, with others (the trustees) responsible for looking after it.\nThe other most common type is a discretionary trust, and the type of trust that a family uses will depend on their aims and circumstances.\nAt that time, I didn't know there were specialist trusts that could protect my son - who is now 15 - and, honestly, I felt ashamed that it had taken a chance meeting for me to learn about them.\nAt the same meeting, a solicitor told a story about \"a beneficiary unable to take valid receipt for an inheritance\". She was describing those who lack the mental capacity to receive their estate. If someone doesn't have the mental capacity to receive an estate, a court-appointed deputy or attorney would have to accept it on their behalf. This threw me again - I'd not even considered whether Tristan would fall into this category and had assumed that if I named him in my will, he'd receive his inheritance, no matter what. These were terms that had not been in any financial planning manual I'd read. I wanted to know more, so I picked up copies of whatever slides, brochures and leaflets I could and left.\nOn the journey home, I thought about our will, finances and plans for the future.\nI'd named my son in my will - I didn't realise that would only cause him problems. I didn't understand what would happen if he didn't have the mental capacity to receive his inheritance. He'd undoubtedly be vulnerable with money in his hands and unable to work or provide for himself. I had so many questions. How could we provide for him safely? How could we protect him, and who would care for him? Would responsibility for him be left to my older son? Did we need to secure his means-tested care? What else had we missed?\nI could see that the financial and legal plans my husband and I had put in place would cause our son nothing short of a financial nightmare. But I didn't know how to address it.\nWhat hope would other parents have if a chartered financial adviser struggled with it?\nSheer panic set in, and I made it my mission to understand. I studied technical manuals, spoke to experts in different fields, and, with a basic grasp of what I needed to do, visited three solicitors, chose one, and arranged our special needs plan for my son.\nAlongside the will, I formed the financial part of the plan. It was an empowering exercise. For every \"wrong way\" of planning for Tristan, two \"right ways\" made more sense.\nSince then, I have held groups for parents at my son's school, where I've pointed out the three main challenges to watch out for. Vulnerable dependants often struggle to access their inheritance; they may become even more vulnerable in receipt of the money; and a direct inheritance can result in the loss of means-tested benefits, care or support.\nOften, these three challenges hit at the same time. Once this perfect storm has happened, it can be devastating and, sadly, very difficult to reverse.\nOne mum told me she was living through one of the challenges herself. Her niece - who lacked capacity - couldn't access the inheritance she had been locked out of, and her means-tested residential home placement was in jeopardy. The mum had tried to help but without success. The matter would have to go to court.\nI hear similar upsetting stories at every parent event I run.\nProblems caused by the wrong will, wrong trust or no will at all remain the number one area of avoidable harm that I see in my practice daily. Parents who want to pass down money to a vulnerable dependant aren't aware they should consider specialist wills and trusts. It certainly didn't occur to me and my husband when our son was diagnosed.\nFor any parent or carer new to special needs planning, I'd offer the following guidance:\n1) Doing nothing is usually not an option. Conventional (or no) financial planning doesn't work for special needs families like ours - it often results in money landing in the hands of the most vulnerable, causing irreparable harm.\n2) The first step is to focus on a positive vision for your young person's future. Can you describe what their best future would look like and document it?\n3) With your vision in hand, find a reputable, qualified solicitor experienced in drafting wills and trusts for the vulnerable and make inquiries. Think about what you want to achieve and never be afraid to ask questions - no caring professional minds.\n4) Drafting a \"letter of wishes\" costs nothing. While not legally binding, it records what you want to happen when you are no longer here, which can be incredibly helpful for those left behind. A will and trust are the crucial foundation of any special needs plan, but documenting your wishes is an important step, too.\n5) Seek support from a local parent-carer forum or charities offering courses on wills and trusts for special needs. Learning some of the technicalities beforehand can put you on the front foot in what can be an emotional journey.\n Planning with Love: A Guide to Wills and Trusts for Parents of Children with Special Needs by Rhiannon Gogh (PS15.99) is published on 8 May and is available now for pre-order.",

      "content": "A 1960s house has been brought back to its former glory, with a contemporary twist \nIt feels as if time has stopped, frozen in the swinging 1960s, as you pass through the pristine gate that opens on to this enchanting lakefront building. The lake in question is the magical and wild Mergozzo, tiny, utterly charming and yet still rarely visited by tourists.\nThe house was built in 1963. Its equally fascinating current owner, Hilary Belle Walker, has American roots - San Francisco is her hometown, but she moved to Italy at the age of 23.\nThe house was a coup de foudre from afar, especially since it had preserved all the charm of its era. In 2018, Hilary, already in love with the area, registered on a real-estate website, almost as a game. When she received an email notifying her of the house's availability, owning it became an obsession. After sending friends to view it, she bought it remotely, without visiting it in person.\nHilary has a keen eye for detail. An entrepreneur in the vintage fashion sector, she's the founder of Bivio Milano, a second-hand boutique chain that has become an institution in the city. She managed to maintain the home's original spirit while adding pieces sourced from markets and warehouses. The two vintage Missoni rugs dominating the living room come from different estates yet harmonise perfectly with the recurring colour palette of green, plum, aubergine and pink - hues that are strikingly contemporary. The burgundy ceiling was deliberately chosen to enhance the ambience. The original green floors remain beautifully preserved. The addition of 1960s wallpaper by a Swedish illustrator amplifies the vintage feel of the space.\nA large glass door opens on to a balcony with its original tiles, offering an uninterrupted view of the lake. A short flight of stairs leads from the ground floor to the sleeping area, where the master bedroom and her daughter's rooms are located. The latter is furnished with twin beds for visiting friends.\nThe bathroom is the only space that underwent a more radical change, though it remains true to the era. Hilary sourced never-used avocado-green fixtures from a nearby warehouse - ideal for recreating the authentic 1960s atmosphere. Outside, a massive stone table sits beneath an old oak tree. Transporting it was a logistical challenge due to its weight, but it now serves as a perfect relaxation and dining spot for friends and family.\nTime flows differently here, compared to the city. Hilary and her daughter live in an apartment in Milan, but escape to the lake whenever school and work allow. A record player replaces Spotify, a DVD player takes the place of Netflix and groceries are bought from the local shop as needed, rather than stockpiled from the supermarket. There's a different way of life here: this Italian region's inhabitants often feel a closer connection to Lombard and Swiss traditions. A welcoming space with unique traditions and habits.\nIn front of the house, a small pathway off the large sloping lawn leads to the road below. Just across the road lies another hidden gem, invisible to passersby: a small private beach that has retained all of the lake's wild and natural beauty. A poetic place to swim undisturbed and read a book.\nIn the end, Hilary has crafted a small, magical universe for herself and her daughter, between the mountain range known as the \"Sleeping Dragon,\" where trains occasionally pass, and a stunning body of water that never fails to deliver on its promise of unspoiled beauty.\nFor more details, go to biviomilano.it",
      "ml_hf_summary": "Hilary Belle Walker purchased a 1960s house in Mergozzo, Italy, after seeing it advertised online.  The house was originally built in 1963 and retains its original charm while incorporating contemporary elements.  Walker, an entrepreneur with a vintage fashion background, sourced furniture and decor from markets and warehouses to maintain the home's authentic feel. The house features original details like green floors, avocado-green bathroom fixtures, and a burgundy ceiling. Walker enjoys a slower pace of life in her lakefront home, where she spends time with her daughter and escapes to the nearby private beach for relaxation. \n"

      "content": "The teams are out on the pitch in Leicester. Now for the anthems. A welcome blast of \"Flower of Scotland\" ... and now Mitchell, in the stands, joins in with a rendition of \"God Save the King\". Oliver Packer, Marlie's son, is one of the mascots.\n\"I've heard parts of the written media say this is an experimental side,\" says the man himself, Mitchell, on the BBC of his selection. \"I think that's somewhat disrespectful to this group. It's a very athletic selection. Marlie Packer is one of the more experienced players ... she'll certainly 'put her head in the spokes' and take the team forward.\"\n\"It's always interesting,\" the former England Women head coach Simon Middleton says on the BBC, of Mitchell's rotation policy. \"I'd have done it differently. John certainly does it his way. He doesn't seem to have any issues whatsoever, rolling the squad for whatever game it is. That's because he's got great confidence in his players.\"\nThe former England captain Marlie Packer remains an \"invaluable\" asset as she prepares for only her second appearance of this year's Women's Six Nations.\nThe veteran Saracens flanker was stripped of the captaincy ahead of the championship and left out of John Mitchell's squad for wins over Wales and Ireland in rounds two and three.\nHaving started the tournament opener against Italy, the 2023 world player of the year has been recalled among nine changes for the clash with Scotland at Welford Road.\nRed Roses head coach Mitchell has been trialling different combinations before this year's home World Cup, with Zoe Aldcroft, who replaced Packer as skipper in January, the only player selected to start all four fixtures. England lock Abbie Ward believes long-term international teammate Packer, 35, continues to make a big impact on and off the pitch.\n\"I don't think there was ever really like a demotion; Marlie's a fantastic leader and always will be, whether she's wearing that armband or not,\" said Bristol player Ward.\n\"Even if she's not on pitch, she brings her experience. Often you speak about the energy that she has and that ferocity but she also has this other side where she brings a calmness to the squad because she's been there, she's done that, she's been in tough games, she's been on the sides of huge wins and also losses, and I think that's just invaluable to us.\n\"But then when she's got the shirt and she's playing, she brings that animal, that's when she brings that ferocity, that's when she brings the energy, the aggression that we need and we feed off as a team. Whether she's playing or not playing, she's doing what she's always done, which is trying to elevate the entire squad.\" (PA Media)\nFrance have gone top of the table with four wins out of four, after beating Italy earlier, but England will retake top spot with a win here. The Red Roses' points difference is +132 while France's is +78.\nTwo years ago the criticism levelled at England was that their attack was predictable as they relied on their maul to get them over the line. When John Mitchell took over the Red Roses before the 2024 Six Nations, the head coach and his staff, particularly the attack coach, Lou Meadows, diversified that area of their game.\nContinuity or experimentation? England have certainly opted for the latter. John Mitchell makes nine changes with Jade Shekells given her first start, at inside-centre, while Marlie Packer lines up at openside flanker. Maddie Feaunati is back in at No 8 with the captain Zoe Aldcroft again at No 6, the only player to start all four matches in the tournament. Rosie Galligan, Sarah Bern and Kelsey Clifford also return to England's starting XV.\nThe Scotland captain, Rachel Malcolm, misses out with concussion and the head coach Bryan Easson has made two changes: Jade Konkel comes in at No 8 and Caity Mattinson assumes scrum-half duties in the absence of Leia Brebner-Holden, who is also concussed. Evie Gallagher switches to the blindside with Malcolm sidelined.\nEngland: Kildunne; Dow, Jones, Shekells, MacDonald; Aitchison, L Packer; Clifford, Atkin-Davies, Bern, Galligan, Ward, Aldcroft (capt), M Packer, Feaunati. Replacements: Campbell, Botterman, Muir, Talling, Matthews, Hunt, Rowland, Scarratt.\nScotland: Rollie; Lloyd, Orr, Thomson, McGhie; Nelson (capt), Mattison; Young, Skeldon, Clarke, Bonar, Boyd, Gallagher, McLachlan, Konkel. Replacements: Martin, Bartlett, Poolman, Ferrie, Bell, Clarke, Phillips Scott.\nFrance produced a second-half fightback to beat Italy 34-21 and maintain their 100% record in the Women's Six Nations, setting up a potential Grand Slam decider against England.\nJoanna Grisez's early try had given France a flying start in Parma, but after French lock Madoussou Fall was sent to the sin-bin for a high tackle, Italy recovered to lead 21-12 at half-time following tries from Vittoria Vecchini, Aura Muzzo and Silvia Turani. Morgane Bourgeois also touched down for the visitors.\nFrance rallied in the second half, going on to secure a bonus point with tries from Romane Menager and Marine Menager before the replacement Alexandra Chambon went over in the last minute - with Les Bleues now set for a potential winner-takes-all showdown away to England on April 26. (PA Media)\nEngland are three bonus-point wins out of three in this tournament and a potential Grand Slam-decider looms against France next Saturday if today's match against Scotland in Leicester goes to form. Scotland have not beaten the Red Roses since 1999 and have never defeated them in the Six Nations - they are also depleted by injury and were beaten by Italy last time out. That explains why Scotland are, as kick-off approaches, available at 200-1 to win on one betting website.\nFor John Mitchell, the England head coach, this tournament is about striking a balance. He wants to try new lineups and partnerships before the Women's Rugby World Cup this summer but establishing a settled side, and giving them a chance to fine-tune and groove those partnerships, should also be a top priority. As of course is winning more silverware.\nEngland will expect to win, and win well, but they've been tested at times in this year's tournament. Accuracy, fluency and execution will be their aim.\nKick-off: 4.45pm BST.",

Fortunately a considerable amount of accommodation was available in the waiting rooms, while many of the enthusiasts found the seats on the platforms handy for a nap.\n\"From an early hour all roads seemed to lead to the stadium. The visitors from the North, as well as thousands of Londoners interested in the great contest, travelled by charabanc, by bus and by train ... there was none of the disorder which occurred at the entrance to the stadium last year.\n\"Cup football is notoriously sensational, but to describe yesterday's final as unusually dramatic can convey but slightly to those who were not there the scene which prevailed when, a few minutes from time, a lightning Newcastle raid led to a goal - and the extinguishing of Aston Villa.\n\"In a sweeping dash, the Newcastle forwards suddenly found a way past the men who hitherto had valiantly baulked them. Cowan scored. A half-minute later and the Villa should have equalised. Straight back bore the men from the North, and Seymour, slipping past a defence which had not recovered from a stunning blow, again had the ball in the net. The first goal, however, had settled the match, which will go down in football history as the game which saw the winners play a reserve goalkeeper (Bill Bradley) whose sterling work paved the way for his side's triumph.\"\nVilla make four changes to their starting line-up in the wake of their brave but ultimately futile 3-2 victory over Paris Saint-Germain in the Champions League on Tuesday evening.

They thumped Crystal Palace 5-0 in the Premier League on Wednesday, so name exactly the same starting XI.\nAston Villa: Martinez, Cash, Konsa, Mings, Maatsen, Kamara, Tielemans, McGinn, Asensio, Rogers, Watkins.Subs: Olsen, Disasi, Barkley, Rashford, Digne, Garcia, Malen, Onana, Ramsey.\nNewcastle United: Pope, Trippier, Schar, Burn, Livramento, Guimaraes, Tonali, Joelinton, Murphy, Isak, Barnes.Subs: Dubravka, Wilson, Gordon, Targett, Krafth, Osula, Willock, Longstaff, Miley.\nBoth of these famous old clubs really enjoyed their recent taste of Champions League football; both of these famous old clubs fancy some more. It's third versus seventh with five points between them and fifth place at the very least the goal. And if that doesn't whet the appetite enough, Villa have won nine of their last ten in all competitions, while Newcastle are on a six-game winning tear that includes the claiming of their first domestic trophy in 70 years. This promises to be a cracker. Buckle up! Or buckle in. Probably best to do both. Kick-off is at 5.30pm BST. It's on!",
      "ml_hf_summary": "The FA Cup final between Aston Villa and Newcastle United took place on May 26, 1924, with Newcastle winning 2-0.  Newcastle's Billy Cowan and Stan Seymour scored the goals in a dramatic match that saw them dominate possession despite Aston Villa having more shots on target. The game was notable for Newcastle's use of their reserve goalkeeper Bill Bradley who played a key role in their victory. Both teams had recently participated in Champions League matches, with Aston Villa losing to Paris Saint-Germain and Newcastle defeating Crystal Palace.  The match is considered significant as it marked Newcastle's first domestic trophy win in 70 years. The game promises to be an exciting encounter between two historic clubs vying for a top-five finish in the Premier League. \n"

      "content": "It was an afternoon of missed opportunities for Arsenal as they fell to a 2-1 defeat to Lyon in the first leg of their Women's Champions League semi-final. Melchie Dumornay's late winner silenced the 40,000-strong Emirates Stadium crowd after Mariona Caldentey's penalty had cancelled out Kadidiatou Diani's opener.\nJoe Montemurro returned to his former stomping ground in north London with a side who are high in confidence, full of star quality and technical brilliance. The eight-times champions are the only side unbeaten in the competition this season, scoring 25 times and conceding only two on the way to the final four.\nThe fact that there was no space in the starting lineup for the all-time Champions League top goalscorer, Ada Hegerberg, illustrates the potency of this Lyon attack. The dynamic trio of Tabitha Chawinga, Dumornay and Diani all started up front, having amassed 11 goals between them in this competition. The one blow for Montemurro was the absence of Wendie Renard who was fit enough only for the bench. The 21-year-old defender Alice Sombath took her place in defence for only her second Champions League start.\nArsenal themselves have been creatively brilliant at times in recent months and they returned to the Emirates after putting five past Leicester in midweek. There was a big boost for the Gunners with the return to fitness of Alessia Russo who took the place of Stina Blackstenius up front. The England international is in fine form and has six Champions League goals this season, second to only Barcelona's Claudia Pina.\nManchester United's hopes of claiming the Women's Super League title suffered a setback as they were held in a goalless draw at West Ham.\nUnited bossed possession and kept West Ham under pressure but failed to make it pay against the determined hosts, who threatened themselves late on and were worthy of their point. The result leaves United five points behind leaders Chelsea, who have a game in hand and face United on 30 April.\nLiverpool moved above Brighton into fifth place with a 2-1 win on the south coast. Olivia Smith turned in an excellent cross from Ceri Holland to open the scoring just two minutes in and Holland set up the second just before half-time, capitalising on a defensive mix-up to tee up Leanne Kiernan.\nNineteen-year-old Michelle Agyemang pulled one back for Brighton at the start of the second half to set Liverpool nerves jangling, but they hung on for victory. PA Media\nThe hosts' nerves were evident from the start as they struggled for rhythm. Loose passes, poor touches and an early yellow card for Caitlin Foord set the tone for much of the first half while Lyon patiently lay in wait to pick Arsenal off with the speed of their attack.\nDanielle van de Donk had the first significant opportunity, inexplicably firing into the side-netting with only Manuela Zinsberger to beat. The visitors did not have to wait too long, however, before they found the breakthrough with a Diani goal that exemplified Montemurro's gameplan. With the Arsenal back line pushing up high, the French international raced through before finishing with aplomb. The hosts thought they had been given a reprieve when the assistant raised the offside flag only to be denied by VAR. The replay showed that Emily Fox had played her onside by inches.\nLyon had found their groove with their front three causing all kinds of problems for the Arsenal defence. The hosts did have a huge opportunity when Frida Maanum sent a free header wide before both sides hit the woodwork - Dumornay and Russo respectively - before the break.\nAnd after half-time a rejuvenated Arsenal took the game to a more sluggish Lyon. A glove from Christiane Endler denied a certain goal from Foord before Russo's follow-up shot was cleared desperately off the line.\nMissed opportunities became the theme of the afternoon for the Gunners who continued to put Lyon's defence under pressure. Mead headed over the bar from an unmarked position before Maanum did the same just minutes later.\nSign up to Moving the Goalposts\nNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women's football\nafter newsletter promotion\nArsenal were given a reprieve when VAR intervened to award them a penalty. As a corner flew in, Endler had connected with Leah Williamson's head rather than the ball, leading to the referee, Alina Pesu, to point to the spot. The noise reverberated around the Emirates as Caldentey stepped up to coolly convert her penalty.\nThe hosts' joy lasted a mere four minutes, however, as Lyon struck back. A turn of speed from Dumornay saw the young Haitian slice through Arsenal's backline to ensure her side had the advantage heading into the second leg.\nThe strike sapped all the energy out of the Emirates crowd and the home players as they succumbed to defeat. These two will meet again in Lyon next Sunday with Slegers' side knowing they have work to do if they are to turn this tie around.",
      "ml_hf_summary": "Arsenal lost 2-1 to Lyon in the first leg of their Women's Champions League semi-final, despite a strong performance from Alessia Russo.  Lyon's Melchie Dumornay scored the winning goal late in the match after Mariona Caldentey had equalized with a penalty for Arsenal. The game saw several missed opportunities for both teams, including a disallowed goal for Arsenal and a near miss by Lyon's Diani.  The result leaves Lyon with a 1-0 lead heading into the second leg next Sunday.  Manchester United drew 0-0 against West Ham in the Women's Super League, while Liverpool defeated Brighton 2-1. \n"

Hearts played the entire second half with 10 men following Michael Steinwender's red card. They were later reduced to nine after Cammy Devlin collected a second yellow. Hearts were sturdy and stuffy enough but, like so often this season, lacked punch.\nAberdeen's lead had come against the run of play. Leighton Clarkson's inswinging corner found the head of Pape Habib Gueye. The forward's attempt crashed back from the Hearts crossbar from where it hit Craig Gordon. The ball duly found the net via the unwitting actions of the Hearts goalkeeper. Jamie McCart and Elton Kabangu had already missed chances to put the Edinburgh side in front at that point.\nHearts were to draw level by the half hour. A deep cross from James Penrice evaded all Aberdeen defenders. Lawrence Shankland, who had been lurking at the back post, slammed home through the legs of Dimitar Mitov. First half parity was fair.\nThere was, however, drama before the break. Steinwender was slow to react as Topi Keskinen raced through on the Hearts goal. The Austrian defender upended Keskinen, 40 yards from goal, with a red card the straightforward outcome. Steinwender had prevented a clear scoring opportunity.\nHearts had no apologies whatsoever to make for a dour, attritional second half. Aberdeen created very little against 10 men. Penrice curled narrowly wide of the Aberdeen goal. Clarkson did likewise at the other end, via a Frankie Kent deflection. Extra time felt inevitable long before it arrived.\nSign up to Football Daily\nKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of football\nafter newsletter promotion\nAberdeen were the dominant force in that spell. Gordon saved superbly from Dabbagh and Alexander Jensen volleyed wide before the crucial moment. Gordon spilled the substitute Jack Mile's low shot, with Dabbagh on hand to force home the rebound.

Oday Dabbagh scored the winning goal for Aberdeen in extra time after a controversial red card for Hearts' Michael Steinwender.

It requested players opting to freshen up first to strictly adhere to the requirement to stay in full view of the chaperone observing them at all times, and that failure to do so would be taken extremely seriously by the ITIA.\nThe move sparked a backlash from fans on social media, with one saying showering in front of someone was \"creepy\" given that some players are teenagers, while Mark Petchey, a British former player who is now a commentator, said it was unacceptable. However, others including Australia's former doubles No 1 Rennae Stubbs said there was nothing new about the rule.\n\"We recognise that parts of the anti-doping testing process are uncomfortable,\" the ITIA said in a statement. \"However, as with all World Anti-Doping Agency-compliant sports - not just tennis - players who are notified for a test after a match are observed at all times by an anti-doping chaperone until the test is completed. This is a requirement of the world anti-doping code.\"\nThe sport's anti-doping authorities have had to fend off criticism in recent months after high-ranked players such as Jannik Sinner and Iga Swiatek escaped long bans for failing drug tests. The ITIA maintains that cases are dealt with based on facts and evidence and not a player's name, ranking or nationality.\nThe former Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority chief Richard Ings added on X that there was nothing incorrect going on in relation to the showering rule. \"This is normal. Players need to be observed passing urine to rule out substitution,\" Ings added. \"Players need to be observed in the shower so they don't pee out urine needed for the analysis.\"\nThe ITIA said it understood that it may take some time for a player to produce a sample and there were permissible delays for reporting to the doping control station - including cooling down and showering. \"Player welfare is a priority and so we will continue to advocate for their right to do this,\" the ITIA added. \"However it is important any activity does not impact the integrity of the sample.

      "content": "Analysts trace a link between financial security and a troubling, increasingly devil-may-care, attitude to political risk \nSteve Coogan wants people to see his new film, The Penguin Lessons, and think about how they might be living in a wealthy cocoon, disengaged from the world.\nThe film's central character - a Briton teaching expat children in Argentina - rescues a penguin and tries to help local people persecuted by the rightwing government. Re-enacting a true story, Coogan is showing how it's possible to be involved in local communities even when the protagonist is an outsider.\nCoogan is concerned about a political shift to the right built on a more selfish outlook, one that focuses on close family and casts a cold eye on people less fortunate. We see it in the US, in the rise of Reform in the UK, and in France and Germany. In the UK, local elections next month will be an opportunity to see if Reform is gaining ground.\nIt's clear that a large and growing group of voters support rightwing candidates, and increasingly those from the far right, who promise to cut taxes, scrap regulations, reduce immigration and protect a singular freedom - \"the freedom to spend your own money as you wish\", whether from a salary or drawing on family wealth.\nTo Make America/Britain/France/Germany great again, policies become ever more outlandish, without any apparent concern for the often terrible side effects.\nWe saw this in the act of economic delusion carried out by Liz Truss in 2022, and we are witnessing it now in the White House. Worse could be to come in the UK should Reform and the National Rally in France and AfD in Germany gain the level of votes needed to influence, if not control, the state.\nPolitical scientists have been tracing the link for some time between financial security and an almost revolutionary, devil-may-care spirit in a growing number of voters.\nAs transformations go, it is a radical shift, and explains the disappearance of political groups like the home counties liberal Conservative - those who put the rule of law, a mixed economy and community spirit near the top of their wish list. They will be replaced by legions of well-heeled suburban voters in big metropolitan areas who rarely read or listen to news bulletins and care more about being left alone, especially by the government.\nIt brings about a different kind of social contract. Not the one that ties the rich to the poor because the rich understand everyone is better off if the poorest are raised up and given opportunities. That was the inclusive postwar capitalism that gave baby boomers all their advantages.\nThis new social contract is one between the better-off baby boomer and the state, which agrees to keep the poor behind high walls and out of sight, allowing the affluent to retain their ill-gotten gains from 30 years of house price increases and final salary occupational pensions (conveniently cancelled across the private sector for the next generation).\nOxford academics Jane Green and Raluca Pahontu found financial security reduces people's risk aversion, making them more tolerant of taking large political risks.\nBen Ansell, professor of comparative democratic institutions at Nuffield College, Oxford, calls the impulse to vote for radical right policies Fadfo - or \"fuck around, don't find out\". Another Fadfo group votes for radical economic policies because they feel left out by society in some way, \"whether it matches to their material circumstances or not\", says Ansell. \"It's about respect and status - or rather the lack of both.\"\nWas Truss the high-water mark for this way of thinking, after millions of people with mortgages found out very quickly the costs of the short-lived prime minister's revolutionary tactics?\nNot so fast. Those left worse off were far from being in the Trussian vanguard. They had not supported her or Boris Johnson or Brexit before that. They were, and are, the house-buying millennials, whose higher level of education puts them more in the Labour/Lib Dem/Green camp.\nRob Ford, professor of politics at the University of Manchester, says age and education have been the defining characteristics of voters in the last three elections.\nThe younger and better educated a person is, the more likely they are to see themselves as progressive. The opposite is true for those turning rightwards.\nFord says it is still true that affluent boomers vote more often than other groups, especially the young.\nThese are depressing messages for Coogan and anyone who is concerned about late-stage capitalism becoming an era when households turn in on themselves - to the benefit of the professional classes and the plutocrats, who get to keep their ill-gotten gains.\nMaybe the Truss experiment will be a turning point. Trump's tariffs could be another: a decade when the gamblers and hucksters promising lottery wins for all are shown to be charlatans.",
      "ml_hf_summary": "Financial security is linked to increased political risk tolerance, according to analysts who have observed this trend in recent years.  Steve Coogan's film \"The Penguin Lessons\" explores this phenomenon through a character who helps others while navigating his own privileged position. Political scientists have documented the rise of right-wing ideologies driven by a desire for individual wealth and limited government intervention. This shift is evident in countries like the UK, France, Germany, and the US, where voters are increasingly drawn to candidates promising tax cuts, deregulation, and reduced immigration.  Oxford academics found that financial security reduces risk aversion, leading individuals to be more tolerant of political risks. The article suggests this trend may have been exemplified by Liz Truss's economic policies in 2022, but it is not limited to her tenure.  The authors suggest that the younger and better-educated are more likely to support progressive policies, while those with less financial security tend to gravitate towards right-wing ideologies. This shift in political landscape raises concerns about a growing divide between the affluent and the rest of society. \n"

      "content": "A Wall Street Journal article offered disturbing details about the billionaire's behavior. Imagine the backlash if he were a woman\nI regret to inform you that, once again, we are all being forced to think about Elon Musk's gonads. Musk, who has had at least 14 children with four women, hasn't officially launched a new mini-Musk for a while, but the Wall Street Journal has just dropped some disturbing details about the billionaire's well-publicized breeding fetish.\nYou'll be familiar with some of these details already. By now we all know that Musk seems to think that the only way to save western civilization is if people like him have as many children as possible. And you've probably read the New York Times report which alleges that Musk, who likes preaching what he practices in regards to populating the world, has a habit of wandering around offering his sperm to strangers.\nWhat you might not know, however, is that Musk is so committed to this idea of himself as a superhero saving the universe that, even in private conversations, he apparently speaks like he is a character in a poorly written sci-fi novel. According to the Journal, Musk reportedly refers to his children as a \"legion\" and has been brainstorming ways to breed more efficiently.\n\"To reach legion-level before the apocalypse we will need to use surrogates,\" he reportedly said to Ashley St Clair, the mother of one of his children, in a text message seen by the newspaper.\nSurrogacy can often be a complex ethical issue. Not in this case. Musk appears to view women as nothing more than walking wombs he can use to further his own narcissistic agenda. Ethics aside for a moment, one has to wonder why a man who styles himself as a tech guru can't figure out a faster way to pop out offspring than surrogacy. At the very least, I'm surprised that Musk hasn't yet followed the lead of the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, who reportedly had visions of using his ranch in New Mexico as a base where women would be inseminated with his sperm and give birth to his babies. But that may come later I suppose. All the money that Doge, Musk's pet government project, has cut from libraries and medical research might, at this very moment, be getting funneled into an Official Institute of Accelerated Insemination.\nWhile Musk may not have a birthing ranch (yet), he does own a very expensive social network which, according to the Journal, he's been using to solicit more baby mamas. Musk has apparently been engaging with the cryptocurrency influencer Tiffany Fong on X, sending so many followers her way that she earned $21,000 over a two-week period from the revenue-sharing programs for creators on the platform. Once she was enjoying how lucrative it was to be on his good side, the billionaire asked Fong if she was interested in birthing his child. You know, as you do. Fong politely declined and Musk swiftly unfollowed her, causing her X-related income to drop.\nWe all know that Musk has very thin skin. How has he responded to the Journal's embarrassing reporting? Honestly, in an unusually restrained fashion. Nobody has been sent to El Salvador (yet), no reporters have been doxed. Musk has just dismissed the piece as scurrilous gossip. On Tuesday he tweeted \"TMZ >> WSJ\". And, in normal circumstances, Musk would be correct that, as long as all parties involved are consenting adults, his private life is no one else's business. But Musk is not your run-of-the-mill rich guy, is he? I don't think Donald Trump or JD Vance believe in very much other than their own advancement. But Musk is an ideologue: he's inserted himself into the top levels of government and is busy rearranging the US according to his worldview. Understanding all the ins and outs of this worldview is now very much a matter of public interest.\nIt's also illuminating, I think, to look at the sort of coverage Musk's shenanigans get, particularly in the conservative press. While people love gawking at Musk, he's still widely seen as an eccentric genius. Even the headline of the Wall Street Journal piece: \"The tactics Elon Musk uses to manage his 'Legion' of babies - and their mothers\", seemed to suggest admiration for his multitasking. I've offered up this thought experiment before, but just humor me again and imagine a world where a woman acted like Musk. You can't, can you? She'd be eviscerated on Fox News. There'd be a million thought pieces about what a terrible mother she was. Absolutely nobody would consider her a genius and she certainly wouldn't be advising the president. There is perhaps no better embodiment of gendered double standards than Musk. And now he's set on exporting those double standards to Mars.\nBeing a journalist in Gaza is a death sentence, with Israel apparently set on ensuring a complete media blackout of the ongoing genocide. On Wednesday, days before her wedding, Fatima Hassouna, a young photojournalist who is the subject of a new documentary, became one of the latest journalists to be killed by Israel. A strike on her home killed her along with 10 members of her family, including her pregnant sister. \"If I die, I want a loud death,\" Hassouna had written on social media. \"I don't want to be just breaking news, or a number in a group, I want a death that the world will hear.\"\nThis is what it means to be Palestinian: to have to beg the world to care about you. To have cowards avert your eyes as you are massacred. To have the architects of your annihilation trot around the world being treated as VIPs by countries that once pretended to care about human rights.\nI fully endorse this.\nWhile gen Z may drink less than previous generations, the gender gap in risky drinking has been narrowing. A new study finds that women aged 18-25 are now actually drinking slightly more than men the same age.\n\"Last week, Amnesty International released a new investigation finding the Rapid Support Forces committed widespread sexual violence, including rape, gang rape and sexual slavery, amounting to possible crimes against humanity,\" Amnesty International's Erika Guevara Rosas said in a statement marking the two-year anniversary of the outbreak of Sudan's civil war. \"Despite these atrocities, the world has largely chosen to remain passive. Alarmingly, the UN Security Council has failed to implement a comprehensive arms embargo on Sudan to halt the constant flow of weapons fueling these heinous crimes.\"\nI chuckled a lot at this headline.\nThe fast-food chain is refusing to apologize to the singer for a tweet suggesting she should be sent back to space. The Blue Origin flight has been widely panned, with the model and actor Emily Ratajkowski saying she was \"disgusted\" by the 11-minute space flight. \"That's end time shit,\" Ratajkowski said. \"Like, this is beyond parody.\"\nRemember when Trump got attacked by an angry bald eagle during a photoshoot in 2015? Unfortunately, the bird kingdom did not properly organize to stop his presidency back then but it seems that some of our feathered friends have decided to fight the Maga powers that be. Last Friday a pigeon landed on Fox News's Peter Doocy's head while the White House correspondent was wrapping up a segment on tariffs. Not the first time that a Fox News correspondent has looked bird-brained.\nArwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnist",
      "ml_hf_summary": "Elon Musk, a billionaire known for his unconventional views and large family size, has been the subject of recent reporting by the Wall Street Journal detailing his breeding practices. The article reveals that Musk reportedly uses surrogacy to expand his \"legion\" of children and seeks to increase his offspring through various means.  He has also engaged in online solicitations for potential baby mamas on social media platforms like X (formerly Twitter). While Musk maintains a restrained public response, the Wall Street Journal's reporting has sparked debate about his methods and their ethical implications. The article highlights the double standards faced by men who engage in such practices compared to women, drawing comparisons with Jeffrey Epstein's alleged actions.  The article also touches on the ongoing conflict in Gaza, where journalists face danger and the UN struggles to address the escalating violence. \n"

      "content": "Neverending calls to automated customer service lines aren't just frustrating - new research suggests they may be quietly radicalising as well\nQuestion: what are the eight most annoying words in the English language? Answer: \"Your call is important to us ... please hold.\" But when you have turned into a gibbering wreck after 10 minutes of your valuable time have ticked away - intermittently punctuated by assurances that, while your tormentor is \"experiencing high call volumes at the moment\", nevertheless your call is still important to him/her/it - you can take comfort in the thought that you are not alone. In fact, you belong to the majority of sentient beings in an industrial society like ours.\nThanks to a useful piece of market research, we now have an idea of the numbers of victims of this industrial practice - at least in the UK. A survey commissioned by the New Britain Project thinktank found that the average Briton spends between 28 and 41 minutes every week coping with inefficient customer service systems, and that nearly four-fifths of them are frustrated by \"the wasted time, the unnecessary friction, and the quiet resignation that has become part of daily interactions with both public and private services\".\nThe survey found that booking NHS or GP appointments was the most frustrating experience, but contacting local council services, energy suppliers, train companies, broadband suppliers, insurance firms and banks were also high on the annoyance scale.\nThe demographics of sufferers are interesting. Predictably, middle-aged people (35-44) are the most frustrated, but younger people (18-34) also spend a lot of time \"on hold\". And, intriguingly, Reform UK supporters seem significantly more frustrated than supporters of other parties - especially when it comes to contacting NHS and council services.\nThis last finding is perhaps the most significant message provided by the survey. It suggests that call fatigue has a political dimension. At any rate, the thinktank that commissioned the survey thinks so. \"Voters are increasingly fed up with a system that wastes their time,\" it says. \"The danger is that this frustration is no longer just background noise, it's now shaping political behaviour. This isn't just annoying, it's political. If ministers don't fix the systems people deal with every day, they risk losing voters to parties that want to tear the whole system down.\"\nThere's something in that. Most voters are not interested in politics. They couldn't give a toss about whether GDP figures are up or down; nor are they exercised about the difference between a recession and a depression. But they do care passionately about some things that are rarely discussed by inhabitants of the Westminster bubble. One is being kept on hold for five minutes while trying to get a GP appointment more than a month ahead. Another is the state of the country's roads - especially in urban areas where streets are increasingly coming to resemble dried riverbeds.\nThese are public-sector problems for which governments and local authorities have responsibility. But the New Britain Project needs to acknowledge that the \"on hold\" problem is also (perhaps mostly) an excrescence of the private sector. It's a creation of a corporate mindset that is happy to sell products or services to people but wants to have as little as possible to do with them afterwards. For many senior executives, customer service is a tiresome and expensive business which involves employing people to deal with the public.\nThe reflex corporate response to this challenge was to outsource the task to call centres, initially located in the UK but later in lower-wage economies overseas. As internet use increased, though, customer service functions were increasingly delegated to websites with which customers could interact. In some contexts - where care and expertise has gone into the design of the site's interface - this has worked reasonably well. But even when it's done properly, there are always cases where the available options provided to the user do not match the complexity of his or her requirements.\nCar insurance sites, for example, are generally fine if you're trying to do a straightforward transaction: get a quote; renew a policy; make a claim; register a change of address. But if you have an inquiry that doesn't fall into these categories then in the end you will have to make a phone call. And then you wind up listening to appalling muzak while being assured that your call is important.\nSadly, the New Britain Project has no proposals for how the private sector could reduce the levels of quiet desperation to which its practices reduce people. But it does have suggestions about what the public sector could do. These include: creating an open-source, centrally supported website platform (gov.local) for local authorities, along the lines of gov.uk; reforming and coordinating local authority procurement of IT services so that there is real competition for the work; mandating common data standards across public services; and making the NHS app and nhs.uk the default digital front door for GP services.\nAll sensible ideas. But don't try phoning the New Britain Project about them. Their website doesn't give their number.\nHere comes the authoritarian coup\n Really sobering assessment by Noah Smith of what's happening in the US.\nNext stop: revolution\n Sci-fi writer Charlie Stross wonders in a blogpost whether the US is moving into a \"pre-revolutionary\" crisis.\nCrisis, which crisis?\n When the polycrisis hits the omnishambles, what comes next?

The survey also revealed a political dimension to call fatigue, as Reform UK supporters reported higher levels of frustration compared to other parties.

      "content": "Social media is turning the spring festival into yet another opportunity for lavish spending. What's in your #EasterBasket? \nAs a child, I was keenly aware of the inequitable practices of the tooth fairy, Santa Claus and the so-called Easter Bunny. How could it be that my teeth were less valuable than Abbie Smith-Arthur's? Why was my stocking sock-sized, and the Walter boys next door had novelty sacks the size of their sofa? For what reason did I get but one big Easter egg, and Bethany down the road got 11?\nIf I was a child today, I would be even more confused (and radicalised), thanks to the relentless rise of \"Eastermas\". More than quarter of British adults now buy Easter presents, giving their loved ones not only chocolate but flowers, toys and clothes. On TikTok, videos tagged #EasterBasket show the headphones, trainers, face creams, keyrings, hoodies, teddies and concert tickets that parents bestow upon their children - in short, more gifts than most people receive at Christmas. I won't deny that it is nice to give each other nice things, but I fear the trend puts pressure on parents, and normalises a level of consumption that would perhaps have been unthinkable even a decade ago.\nPop into any high street shop and you will see our current levels of capitalist egg-cess. John Lewis sells carrot-shaped string lights and bunny-shaped wreaths; for PS10, you can get a snow globe featuring two bunnies in a carrot car. Who among us doesn't need a \"plush chicken ballpoint pen\" from Flying Tiger, or egg-shaped salt and pepper shakers from Next? And nothing says \"he is risen\" like the PS52 \"Easter Luxury Beauty Box\" from Boots, featuring \"revitalising supreme youth power creme\".\nIt's not that I think we shouldn't go all out at Easter. My mum has long hung little decorations on an \"Easter tree\" in our dining room - and she has a wooden bowl of hand-painted eggs passed down from her own mother. But I do worry that the PS3 speckled egg-shaped side plates from Dunelm are not made to last in the same way. I fear that no one actually has the cupboard space for an PS18 plant pot moulded like a bunny in a mint green suit and matching top hat. It's hard not to think of this stuff as landfill fodder that will be used once and never again.\nThere's an easy retort to my cynicism: let people enjoy things! We live in dark times and have to find happiness where we can! But who told you that joy could be bought? Who popularised the idea that shopping was self-care? Commenting on Eastermas, a senior seasonal manager at the supermarket Ocado told the Guardian: \"After a long winter, people are looking for something to celebrate.\" How very considerate, then, that Ocado wants to help us celebrate with PS18 pull-apart Easter crackers.\nI think we all need to scrutinise how happy spending actually makes us - and how long that feeling really lasts before we're overwhelmed by the desire to declutter. If you Google \"Easter toys\", the search engine reveals that other people have Googled: \"What to get kids for Easter who have everything?\" Might there be alternatives that make us happier than more stuff?\nBecause no offence to Bethany down the road, but I'm certain I savoured my one Easter egg more than she did her 11. If you're looking for a bit of happiness in these difficult times, instead of buying something new may I suggest an egg-tapping battle? It's a tradition in my Polish family - and I believe many others - to dye and paint eggs (real ones, not glass ones from Oliver Bonas) and then smash them into each other to see whose cracks first. We never stuffed baskets with headphones and hoodies but instead filled them with bread, eggs, sausage and salt that would be blessed by a priest in a ceremony known as \"swieconka\". Of course, for many Easter is now secular, but that doesn't mean it can't still be meaningful, marked by what we create rather than what we consume.\nAccording to the market research company Kantar, 3.4 million Britons will spend PS50 each on Easter gifts this year - and most of these people are parents. I don't think it's a coincidence that these high spenders are also more likely to consume magazines and video on demand than the average adult. Easter baskets stuffed with gifts seem to be an American tradition that's starting to cross the Atlantic thanks to social media. And it's not just Easter: we are living in an era of extreme basketification, with Halloween boo baskets, Christmas Eve boxes, 1 December boxes, Valentine's baskets and burr baskets (for the winter) popularised on TikTok. Now, hardly a month can go by in which parents aren't expected to fill a basket with tat for their kids.\nSix years ago, my brother and I broke an Easter decoration that has been in our family for decades. That makes it sound like a terrible accident: in fact, we deliberately smashed the black-and-red painted egg because we shook it and heard an ominous rattle within. Our curiosity got the better of us and we cracked it open to discover a petrified purple-brown yolk that our dog inexplicably wanted to eat. I get that breaking an heirloom - even if it is a literal rotten egg - is wasteful, but I'd still venture that it's far less wasteful than a metre-long artificial grass table runner.\nIt's not that I'm recommending destroying decorations as a fun-filled, family Easter activity, but I think I do recommend filling your home with meaningful (if biohazardous) objects that are made to last. I recommend painting an egg or rolling it down a hill, and gluing fluffy yellow chicks to a bonne. And, of course, buying your child some chocolate eggs - just definitely less than 11.\nAmelia Tait is a freelance features writer",
      "ml_hf_summary": "A recent study by Kantar indicates that 3.4 million Britons will spend £50 on Easter gifts this year, with most of these individuals being parents. The trend of \"Eastermas\" has seen an increase in the gifting of non-chocolate items like toys, clothes, and electronics to children, leading to a significant rise in consumer spending. This phenomenon is fueled by social media platforms such as TikTok, where videos showcasing elaborate Easter baskets have gained popularity.  The article highlights concerns about the pressure this trend places on parents and normalizes excessive consumption levels that may not be sustainable or necessary. It suggests alternative ways to celebrate Easter, emphasizing meaningful traditions like egg-decorating and family activities over material possessions. \n"

      "content": "Across the country, there's a demographic shift. This is a chance to reinvest in our threadbare education system\nPrimary school offer day has become a bittersweet moment in many communities. While anxious parents will breathe a sigh of relief upon securing their first-choice school, the chance of success has increased as reception applications have continued to fall. Falling birthrates and the cost-of-living crisis driving families out of more expensive cities, such as London, has led to shortages in primary school application numbers. The result? Undersubscribed schools lose out, with those that are more popular filling their spaces.\nThis year in London, where some of the country's highest-performing schools are located, (96% are rated good or outstanding by Ofsted), applications for reception places fell by 2.1%. It is a worrying continuation of a downward trend. On Wednesday, nearly 88% of applicants secured their first-choice school, compared with 81.1% in 2014 when records began.\nA starker illustration of the problem can be found in the local authority of North East Lincolnshire. It has been able to offer every single applicant their first preference school. In the council's almost breathless announcement of this news, it acknowledges \"this is unprecedented\" - and it speaks volumes.\nIn London, declining demand has resulted in the closure or mergers of schools, despite parent and teacher-led campaigns to keep them open.\nIt is not only an urban issue. In rural communities, primary schoolsare often at the heart of community life - from summer fetes and after school clubs providing much needed wraparound care, to charity appeals and quick chats at the school gate. Closures, therefore, are making a devastating impact. The county of North Yorkshire has more rural schools than any other part of England; it has had to close 34 primary schools since 2018, more than anywhere else in England over the preceding six years.\nDriven by falling enrolment and the financial strain that ensues, the closure of a primary school is a blow to families, and a loss of employment for the school meal supervisors, caretakers, teachers and teaching assistants who make up its staff body.\nAs pupil numbers shrink, so too have school budgets in real terms. For the last financial year, the Department for Education (DfE) acknowledged that the funding which goes to mainstream schools has risen by approximately 7.1%. In the same breath, the DfE's technical note unabashedly estimates that nationally schools' costs actually rose by 7.7%. In a dispiriting summation, the DfE accepts that this means our schools have been given PS250m less than it costs to run them.\nAs has been the case since the advent of Tory austerity, headteachers are forced to make impossible choices. Are they to cut teaching staff or reduce vital support services needed for pupils with additional needs in order to make their already strained resources stretch further? These cuts are landing at arguably the worst possible time - unprecedented numbers of children are seeking mental health support, persistent absence is at record highs and the demand for education, health and care plans has risen by as much as 50% in some councils in the past 12 months.\nDespite a refusal to scrap the two-child benefit cap, the government insists it is on a \"mission\" to break down barriers to opportunity for every child. To do so, it vows to work hard to \"see a sustained rise in school outcomes\" that will build \"young people's life skills\". These are empty words without the ballast of funding needed to secure their worthy aims. Even the DfE concedes schools won't be able to afford the 2.8% pay rise offered to teachers without plugging the shortfall with that favoured euphemism for cuts - \"efficiencies\". After years of austerity, where exactly is the \"fat\" schools are supposed to cut?\nThe government could - were it visionary and daring - consider the suggestion of former general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL) Geoff Barton. Addressing this issue at the ASCL conference last year, Barton outlined how \"population estimates predict that the number of pupils in England's schools will fall by half a million over the next five years\". This, yes, could be viewed as a huge multi-billion pound saving. But, Barton proposed, \"instead of raking this money back into the Treasury,\" the government could alternatively see it as \"a golden opportunity to put education on a more sustainable footing\".\nViewed as a dividend to be reinvested into our underfunded education system, this demographic shift is a chance to raise per-pupil funding and increase the amount additionally given to schools for improving the educational outcomes of disadvantaged pupils. It is, to paraphrase Barton, a policy costing not a lot extra, but which would nonetheless \"make a world of difference\". The question is whether this government has the mettle to allow its fiscal prudence to align with its touted quest for social justice.\nOur education system cannot weather further austerity, and falling pupil numbers should not be viewed as an opportunity to strip funding away from our children. The government must accept that a changing country requires a reimagined approach for a sustainable education system. Reinvesting in our children should be an easy choice to make. They are worth it.\nLola Okolosie is an English teacher and writer",
      "ml_hf_summary": "Primary school application numbers have declined across the UK, leading to undersubscribed schools and closures in some areas. London has seen a 2.1% decrease in applications, with nearly 88% of applicants securing their first choice school.  North East Lincolnshire is an example of a local authority that successfully offered every applicant their first preference school. Rural communities are also experiencing school closures due to declining enrollment and financial strain. The Department for Education acknowledges funding increases for schools but also reports a shortfall in resources, forcing headteachers to make difficult choices regarding staffing and support services.  Geoff Barton suggests the government could invest in education by redirecting funds from population decline, potentially leading to increased per-pupil funding and improved outcomes for disadvantaged pupils. \n"

      "content": "The hit Netflix show Adolescence has ignited debate about the future of UK television. Public service broadcasting must stand up to the streaming giants\nHappy Valley, Top Boy, Doctor Who, Slow Horses, Killing Eve, I Will Destroy You, Fleabag and, most recently, Adolescence - at first glance, it seems perverse to argue that British TV drama is in crisis. But this is the message from leading figures within the industry.\nAmid headline-grabbing debates about the dangers of toxic online content to children sparked by Adolescence, the show has provoked discussion about the threat to British TV from streaming services. Co-written by the British writers Jack Thorne and Stephen Graham, and filmed with British actors in the north of England, Adolescence was funded by the US company Netflix. In February the platform launched the acclaimed Toxic Town, also written by Thorne, dramatising the 1995 toxic waste scandal in Corby.\nWhy weren't these shows - about British working-class people with a strong social purpose - made by the BBC, ITV or Channel 4? According to Peter Kosminsky, the Bafta-award winning director of Wolf Hall, the answer is simple: the public service broadcasters can no longer afford to make high-end drama. He is calling for a levy on the streamers - a \"Netflix tax\" - to be channelled back into British programme-making.\nStreaming has changed how we consume television (less than half of young people watch linear TV in a week) and sent production costs spiralling, with disastrous consequences - 70% of the freelancers on whom the industry depends are out of work, with senior producers forced to take jobs stacking shelves or to retrain altogether. It is also dictating the kind of shows being made. Cash-strapped executives are backing projects with international appeal - like Adolescence - at the expense of unscripted programmes and less splashy, uniquely British dramas.\nWolf Hall is one of the undisputed jewels in the BBC's crown. But Kosminsky says he would not be able to make the final instalment, The Mirror and the Light, today. The executive producer of ITV's surprise triumph Mr Bates vs the Post Office has said the same of the four-part series that drew in 4 million viewers an episode and led to new legislation. Both shows only aired last year.\nIt is hard to imagine Netflix giving the green light to a TV series about a software malfunction in the UK Post Office. But in four hours of primetime TV, Mr Bates vs the Post Office succeeded where a decade of campaigning and journalism had failed - to make us understand the human suffering behind the headlines. Following in the tradition of Ken Loach's Cathy Come Home, the series showed that TV can be a powerful tool for social change.\nIts impact was testament to the importance of public service broadcasting. The BBC, ITV and Channel 4 have been training grounds for many of today's biggest names, without which we may not have the future Thorne, or Phoebe Waller-Bridge, or Michaela Coel. Television is hailed as the most democratic art form. If people can no longer afford to make a living from it, diversity on and off screen will suffer.\nThe 7 million people tuning in live for The Traitors finale on BBC One in January proved that \"appointment TV\" is not dead yet. But successful television isn't just about viewing figures. It is about telling the stories of those who might otherwise be overlooked, the \"skint little people\", as Mr Bates puts it. Amid the battle between public service broadcasters and streaming giants, it is critical that those narratives do not get lost.\nDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

      "ml_hf_summary": "The Netflix show \"Adolescence\" has sparked debate about the future of British television.  Public service broadcasters (PSBs) are facing financial challenges due to streaming services like Netflix, which have shifted production costs and audience consumption habits. This is leading to a decline in high-end British drama production as executives prioritize international appeal over unscripted programs.  The article cites examples such as \"Mr Bates vs the Post Office\" and \"Wolf Hall,\" highlighting the impact of PSBs on social change and diversity in television.  A call for a \"Netflix tax\" is being made to fund British program-making, with experts arguing that this would help revive the industry and ensure continued production of diverse content. \n"

      "content": "The renowned designer's lasting creative influences are celebrated by Portia Dadley, while John P Butler shares a touching memory of his late wife's love of a Morris pattern\nRe your editorial (The Guardian view on William Morris: how the Strawberry Thief took over the world, 11 April), William Morris developed the Strawberry Thief pattern at his Merton Abbey Works on the banks of the River Wandle.\nThe workers who turned the design into a \"swinish luxury\" formed a close-knit community - the carpet knotter Eliza Merritt remembered \"a tradition of comradeship\"- whose members lived long, creative lives. The tapestry weaver William Sleath was rescued from destitution by Morris, who took him on as an apprentice at age seven.\nSleath became a sensitive artist who continued to produce oils and watercolours into his 70s. His fellow weavers Walter Taylor and William Knight painted still lifes and scenes around Merton Abbey.\nFar from failing in \"his dream of making art for all\", Morris sowed seeds of creativity at Merton Abbey that grew in radical ways. Taylor left the works to become a teacher, and delivered a tapestry course at the Central School of Arts and Crafts designed to provide occupational therapy and retraining for soldiers disabled in the first world war. One of his first students was Percy Sheldrick, who was employed at Merton Abbey after the course and rose to become master weaver.\nThose seeds continue to grow. Strawberry Thief may have taken over the world, but in south-west London the community arts group Made in Merton is trying to keep it local with activities that aim to connect people to the spirit of collective making. In our first project we made banners in a community workshop bearing the words \"art\", \"made\" and \"people\", with the letters cut from upcycled Morris fabrics. We then marched along the River Wandle, ending up outside the local Sainsbury's, which stands on the site once occupied by Merton Abbey Works. A glorious occasion, made by the people and for the people.Portia DadleyMade in Merton, London\n When my wife, Helen, was dying last year it was thought we could get carers and have her at home instead of hospital. I told her I was buying new curtains for the room she would be in and ordered some with William Morris's Strawberry Thief design to be made at Cae Du Designs in Harlech. There they are in the room where she would have died. She never came home, so she never saw them, but was overjoyed that I'd ordered her favourite Morris design for her. When I look at them, I think of her exclaiming her delight, and so I'm grateful to William Morris.John P ButlerPwllheli, Gwynedd\n Do you have a photograph you'd like to share with Guardian readers?

The legacy of Morris continues today through Made in Merton, a community arts group that uses Morris fabrics to create banners and engage with local residents.

She is also the co-founder of the World Weather Attribution initiative, which seeks to determine the influence of global warming on intensity and likelihood of an extreme weather event. The project also examines how factors such as ill-suited architecture and poverty exacerbate heatwaves, hurricanes, floods and wildfires. This is the theme of her second book, Climate Injustice: Why We Need to Fight Global Inequality to Combat Climate Change.\nThe thesis of your book is that the climate crisis is a symptom of global inequality and injustice. That will be quite topsy-turvy to some people, who think global heating is caused by the amount of carbon that we are putting into the atmosphere.Yes, of course, if you just stick to the physics, then the warming is caused by the amount of carbon in the atmosphere, but the amount of carbon in the atmosphere is caused by the burning of fossil fuels. And it is also the case that those who benefit from the burning of fossil fuels are the few already wealthy people who have stakes in or own the companies themselves. The vast majority of people do not benefit. The American dream is social mobility, not burning fossil fuels.\nYou are arguing that racism, colonialism and sexism all underpin global heating. Tackling those things seems more challenging than a technical solution for the climate crisis.Of course it's more challenging than just inventing some stuff. But we have solar and other renewable sources of energy and this isn't solving the problem. The problem will only be solved if we address the underlying causes. I argue those are the inequalities in our society.\nSome would say those kind of statements are political, and scientists should stick to the science.The idea of writing this book came through my work because every time we do a study, we look at what the role of climate change is in the weather event that ultimately led to disasters. But we also look at what else is happening, who was affected, why were they affected. I would say in all cases, what turns weather into a disaster is not how much it rained but how vulnerable people are and how well prepared. Therefore, depending on which type of weather event we are looking at and where in the world we are, we always find that the more unequal the society is, be that a US city or a state in western Africa, the more severe the consequences.\nThe relationship between the extraction of fossil fuels and colonialism and racism seems clear, but can you explain how sexism intersects with global heating?In all the studies we have done, we have found that the more patriarchal the structures in a society, the worse the consequences of climate change are. If women are excluded from decision-making and don't have access to finance, many more people die and lose their livelihoods in extreme weather.\nWhy do you find the term natural disaster misleading? There are natural hazards, although because of climate change, they're also becoming quite unnatural in some instances. But whether it turns into a disaster has very little to do with nature and a lot to do with social vulnerability.\nIs the Cop [UN climate summit] process fit for purpose? It seems to be more about maintaining the status quo.It is definitely not fit for purpose because it's not achieving what we need: faster change and change that would really benefit the majority of the people and not just the very few. But it's not the fault of the Cop process. It has actually achieved quite a lot because if we hadn't had this conversation, we would be on track to a four- or five-degree [warmer] world. We are now on track to a three-degree world, which is still a world we absolutely do not want to live in. But it is thanks to the Cop process that we talk about climate change on an international global level. The Paris agreement states that we care about climate change because it violates human rights and we want to do something about it. That is a major achievement. What we have to do now is not to say: \"Oh it's all shit, let's abandon it all.\" But how can we make these institutions stronger because they can serve us well and we need them.\nDo individuals bear responsibility too? Politicians, businesspeople, even scientists?The process - as in the institutions, Cop, international justice etc - is great, but it can only work if all individuals support it. At the moment we see that many try to dismantle them, all of us have a duty to fight for them, policymakers, scientists etc. Without these institutions there will be no prosperity.\nYou write about the Pacific north-west heatwave of 2021, which caused more than 1,000 deaths and had enormous economic impact. Does it concern you that tragic events like this don't appear to be wake-up calls?We do need wake-up calls, but we need more than that. Without having an idea of what to do, they won't suffice. But we have learned some things from these events. For example, the biggest difference in every extreme event for the death toll is whether there are functioning early warning systems or not. We saw this with Hurricane Helene: in Florida people are used to hurricanes and are aware that if there is a forecast that says evacuate, you have to evacuate. But a bit further north in the Appalachians, [where] people are less used to it, they didn't. Plus there was a lot of disinformation and the FEMA [Federal Emergency Management Agency] was attacked for trying to help people. So the death toll was much higher.\nOne Republican congresswoman suggested that the US government created the hurricane.The fact that you can say that and probably half the people who would listen to you would think: \"Yeah, why not?\" That's a big issue. I don't know how to solve the \"facts don't matter any more\" problem.\nCalling those people climate-crisis deniers seems inadequate.The more incredible the lie, the better it sticks. We have so many lines of evidence and so much data and it all shows the same thing. By questioning the data, you can't create arguments that climate change isn't happening. So I guess the fact-free approach is actually the result of the success of science.\nYou described the Pacific north-west heatwave as being \"mathematically impossible\"; that it was so rare that it could only happen once in 100,000 years.Yes, if you don't take climate science into account. Once you take global warming into account, it goes from being outside everything you would expect from a normal statistical assessment to 1 in 100 or 200.\nAnd those odds are shortening?Yes, very much so. So in a two-degree world you would expect to see this once every five years or so.\nEarlier this month a board member of global insurer Allianz SE noted that we are on track for a rise of 2.2C and 3.4C above preindustrial levels. He said a rise of 3C would render many regions uninsurable and make investment too uncertain - ultimately capitalism would cease to be viable. Does that ring true to you?It's interesting to hear it in such terms from an insurer. Capitalism as we know it now would be unviable. We are on track to tear it down by accident.\nClimate Injustice by Friederike Otto is published by Greystone (PS22). To support the Guardian and Observer order your copy at guardianbookshop.com.

      "ml_hf_summary": "Friederike Otto, a climate scientist, argues in her book \"Climate Injustice\" that global inequality exacerbates the effects of climate change.  Otto's research shows that social vulnerability, not just the severity of weather events, determines whether they become disasters. She contends that racism, colonialism, and sexism contribute to this inequality, impacting how people are affected by extreme weather events. Otto believes the current COP process is inadequate for addressing climate change effectively, but it has been a crucial platform for raising awareness.  She emphasizes the importance of individual action in supporting institutions like the COP and scientific research. The Pacific Northwest heatwave of 2021 serves as an example of how social vulnerability can amplify the impact of extreme weather events. Otto's book highlights the urgency of addressing climate change, emphasizing that current trends point towards a three-degree increase in global temperature, which would render many regions uninsurable and destabilize capitalism.  \n"

      "content": "Peer-reviewed study's findings raises fresh question on the toxic substances' impact on fertility\nMicroplastics have been found for the first time in human ovary follicular fluid, raising a new round of questions about the ubiquitous and toxic substances' potential impact on women's fertility.\nThe new peer-reviewed research published in Ecotoxicology and Environmental Safety checked for microplastics in the follicular fluid of 18 women undergoing assisted reproductive treatment at a fertility clinic in Salerno, Italy, and detected them in 14.\nFollicular fluid provides essential nutrients and biochemical signals for developing eggs. Contaminating that process with bits of plastic quite likely has implications for fertility, hormonal balance and overall reproductive health, the authors wrote.\nThe findings represent a major step toward figuring out how and why microplastics impact women's reproductive health, but are also \"very alarming\", Luigi Montano, a researcher at the University of Rome and study lead author, said.\n\"This discovery should serve as an important warning signal about the invasiveness of these emerging contaminants in the female reproductive system,\" the study states.\nFrom the top of Mt Everest to the bottom of the Mariana Trench, microplastics and smaller nanoplastics have been detected throughout the environment. Food is thought to be a main exposure route: recent studies found them in all meat and produce products tested.\nMicroplastics are particularly dangerous because they can contain any number of 16,000 plastic chemicals. That includes highly toxic compounds like PFAS, bisphenol and phthalates that are linked to cancer, neurotoxicity, hormone disruption or developmental toxicity.\nMicroplastics have been found throughout the human body and can cross the brain and placental barriers.\nMontano's latest paper is part of a larger project he's leading for which he has also detected microplastics in human urine and semen, and examines the impacts on fertility. He said he suspects microplastics are among chemicals driving plummeting sperm counts and a drop in overall sperm quality.\n\"We have proven this decline, especially in areas where pollution is bad,\" Montano said.\nThough men are more susceptible to the substance's toxic effects, he added, women are also possibly impacted. Animal research has linked the presence of microplastics to ovarian dysfunction and health problems, like reduced oocyte maturation, and a lower capacity for fertilization. Another study on mice showed alterations to ovarian tissue.\nThe paper notes a \"possible presence of correlation between the concentration of microplastics\" and reproductive health in the women who participated in the new study.\nMontano added that the bisphenol, phthalates, PFAS and other highly toxic chemicals that use microplastics as a \"trojan horse\" to get into the body, and into the ovaries, are \"very dangerous\". The chemicals are already well-known for disrupting hormones and harming women's reproductive health.\nThe follicular fluid paper offers a \"very important finding\", said Xiaozhong Yu, a University of New Mexico microplastics researcher, but he added that more work is needed to determine the dose and level of exposure at which adverse effects start to happen.\n\"This is the work in the next phase - we need to quantify,\" Yu said. His team is also attempting to answer some of those questions with broader epidemiological research.\nMontano's team is doing similar work, and he's spearheading research that is trying to determine how much reducing the use of plastic in the kitchen and eating an organic diet, will reduce the level of microplastics in the body.\nThe substances' ubiquity makes it difficult to avoid, but reducing the amount of plastic used in the kitchen - from packaging to storage to utensils - can likely reduce exposures. Pesticides can contain microplastics, or in some cases are a form of microplastics, so eating organic may help.\nExperts also advise that people avoid heating plastic, or putting hot food and liquid in plastic.\nSingle-use paper coffee cups, for example, can shed trillions of bits of plastic when hot liquid is added. Similarly, tea bags can release billions of particles, and microwavable plastic is also a problem. Plastic utensils that briefly come into contact with hot pans can also leach chemicals, and wood and stainless steel alternatives are better.",
      "ml_hf_summary": "A peer-reviewed study published in Ecotoxicology and Environmental Safety found microplastics in the follicular fluid of 14 out of 18 women undergoing assisted reproductive treatment at a fertility clinic in Italy.  The presence of microplastics, which can contain harmful chemicals like PFAS and phthalates, raises concerns about their potential impact on female fertility, hormonal balance, and overall reproductive health. The study suggests a possible correlation between microplastic concentration and reproductive health outcomes, but further research is needed to determine the exact dose-response relationship.  Experts emphasize the need for reducing plastic use in daily life, including avoiding heating plastic containers and opting for organic food options, as these measures can help minimize exposure to microplastics. \n"

      "content": "City residents are working out how to fill their streets with trees as evidence grows of their benefits\n\"I wanted to do something that would benefit as many people from the community as possible,\" says Chloe Straw, pointing at a small but promising sapling visible through the window of her local cafe.\nIn 2023, Chloe began chatting to her neighbours in Haringey, north London, about trees. \"I thought it'd be really nice to raise some money for trees on the main road. Everyone uses West Green Road, regardless of whether you have a lot of money or not, regardless of your background.\"\nAfter getting in touch with Trees for Streets, a sponsorship scheme that guides communities across England on how to plant trees in their local areas with support from local councils, a small group was formed to work out how to do it. As a first step, Straw and friends were provided with an interactive map to choose the location of the trees, and that was passed along to Haringey council.\nThen they got help to set up a crowdfunding campaign, which was shared in local WhatsApp groups and community forums, secured 168 backers and raised more than PS6,000 in one month.\nMohamed al-Jawhari, a co-chair of Haringey Living Streets, said: \"It [WhatsApp] is a very powerful tool for getting a very simple message out very quickly to a lot of people. I got in contact with, like, a thousand people in a few minutes, because I forwarded on the message with a bit of an explanation to a local group here, a local group there, people who were interested in the environment and maybe wanted to help West Green.\"\nThe remaining costs were covered by Haringey council. The result? Twenty beautiful trees planted across the neighbourhood.\nThe plan is as local as it gets, but it is also global. Around the world, city residents are working out how to fill their streets with trees as evidence grows of their benefits. As temperatures rise, research has shown that urban trees can play a fundamental role in keeping cities cool, evaporating water to provide a natural form of air-conditioning, cooling air temperatures and reducing the urban heat island effect. Work by Friends of the Earth in five English cities in 2023 showed that areas with more trees and greenery were up to 5C cooler.\nCities and countriies are applying all kinds of models. Some councils and governments plant the trees using public money. In 2021, for example, the Canadian government launched the 2 Billion Trees programme, providing financial support to provinces, organisations and Indigenous governments to plant trees over a period of 10 years.\nBut public funds are stretched everywhere, and the community model followed by Trees for Streets empowers local people to take their own action without waiting for a government plan.\nThe Pennsylvania Horticultural Society (PHS) is a non-profit organisation in Philadelphia that trains individuals to lead community groups to plant trees across the US city. So far their programme, Tree Tenders, has trained more than 6,500 people, who have led volunteers in planting more than 3,000 trees each year.\nAndrew Conboy, an urban forester in Philadelphia whose work involves managing, maintaining and replanting street and park trees in the city, said: \"Most of the tree planting in Philadelphia is done through PHS. They do really great work all around the city and also in the suburbs surrounding the city. So many groups surrounding the cities are Tree Tenders groups.\"\nHe added: \"There's a heavy emphasis on native species here in the Philadelphia area, which is good thing because the native species are ultimately better for our wildlife and for our ecosystems, because those are the species that evolved here, and our wildlife need those species.\"\nThe Garden City Fund, a charity in Singapore, runs a similar initiative, the Plant-a-Tree programme. Individuals and organisations can donate to the cost of a young tree and then plant it in one of their managed green spaces.\nSign up to Down to Earth\nThe planet's most important stories. Get all the week's environment news - the good, the bad and the essential\nafter newsletter promotion\nTree People, an environmental advocacy organisation, runs a forestry programme that supports communities to plant and care for trees in cities in southern California. The organisation also runs the School Greening programme, which provides training to parents, students, teachers and district leaders to plant and maintain trees in schools. Since the organisation was founded in 1973, it has worked with 3 million volunteers to plant more than 3m trees, included 30,000 trees on school campuses.\nAs the West Green residents take turns discussing their local initiative over cups of coffee, it's clear that one of the most significant impacts the project has had is in strengthening connections within the community.\nNick Owen, the owner of the local cafe Perkyn's on West Green Road, who contributed to the crowdfunder, said: \"It's lovely having the trees here now but it also feels a bit like a legacy. In five or 10 years when these trees are getting bigger and fuller, it'll be beautiful to see our kids growing up with that as well and knowing that we contributed to it.\"\nDan Snell, an urban forest officer at Haringey council who surveyed the location for the trees in West Green and works with communities on tree-planting initiatives across the borough, said: \"We have people who are enthusiastic about the long-term health of the trees and we want it to be something they can take ownership of, I suppose, like an extension of their home, something that's in the public realm but is also looked after by the community.\n\"There was another tree scheme on my mum's street who lives in Haringey ... suddenly there were all these new street trees and my mum had met a load of neighbours that she hadn't really met before, even though she's been there for 30 years. It's had this really lovely long-term effect on bringing the street together. It's such a wonderful thing to connect over.\"",
      "ml_hf_summary": "In Haringey, north London, residents are working with Trees for Streets to plant 20 trees on West Green Road.  Chloe Straw initiated the project after noticing the benefits of urban trees in cooling cities. The initiative was funded through a crowdfunding campaign and local council support, raising over £6,000. This model is being replicated globally as cities seek solutions to combat rising temperatures. Organizations like the Pennsylvania Horticultural Society (PHS) and the Garden City Fund are empowering communities to plant trees using public funds or donations.  Tree People in California focuses on school-based forestry programs and community tree planting initiatives. These projects not only improve urban environments but also foster community engagement and connection. \n"

      "content": "Schools are pushing out established groups as funding for more places comes on stream\nA government pledge to create more nurseries has backfired, according to early years providers. More than a dozen schools are evicting existing preschool providers that operate in classrooms amid concerns they are doing so to access state funding to set up their own provision.\nIt means that the pledge to create thousands of nursery places may be fulfilled by cannibalising some of the existing preschools, according to the Early Years Alliance (EYA).\nThe umbrella group said in some cases schools were offering less childcare and for fewer children than the private, voluntary and independent (PVI) nurseries that had previously worked on their premises, so parents would be forced to find childminders to maintain their existing levels of care.\nOn 2 April the government approved funding for the first 300 school-based nurseries to meet its pledge to create more than 100,000 new places in England for children from nine months old.\nMany private nurseries already operate on school premises, and only 9%, or 27, of the 300 schools with funding have confirmed they are working with their nursery tenants.\nSo far, 15 preschools have contacted EYA to say they had been told they would need to leave at the end of the summer term.\nNeil Leitch, EYA chief executive, said ministers had intended the nursery funding to address \"childcare deserts\", where parents were forced to stay at home rather than work because there was no help available.\n\"They said they were really keen to work alongside existing providers because, if you're not careful, you risk creating a childcare desert somewhere else,\" he said.\n\"The policy seems to have significantly drifted from what we were led to believe - that there would be additional support where it was needed and it would not damage the PVI sector. To sideline the existing provision is folly. It is short-term folly.\"\nLeitch said PVI nurseries that work with the most vulnerable families tended to be in less affluent areas and disrupting funding made it more likely they would be forced to shut.\nHe added he was disappointed that Department for Education (DfE) guidance suggested schools should make it easier to evict PVIs or childminders by giving them licences rather than leases, which gave security of tenure.\n\"Many are starting to feel this government is anti- existing providers. It may be an unintended consequence, but when you write statements encouraging schools to not give decent leases to the PVI sector, it's difficult to interpret it in any other way.\"\nAlison Wilkinson leads a volunteer playgroup with 24 three- to four-year-olds in Doncaster that has been active for 32 years.\nBut the primary school it operates from has told it to leave by July, she said, and although it has finally found an alternative building, the venue needs refurbishment, threatening the future of the preschool and its charity, which offers support and equipment such as buggies for new parents. \"If we don't get any support, we're going to close come September and there's jobs that are going to be lost and the community isn't going to have a charity that supports them,\" she said.\n\"It's really stressful,\" she added. \"We're struggling to get tradesmen quotes. Being a nonprofit, we can't get grants until you've got quotes, then you've got to wait for the grant. And we've got to re-register with Ofsted.\n\"We've never had to advertise. Parents come back to us year on year. They're very upset because they love my staff. Basically we've got to build this whole new community again.\"\nWilkinson's preschool offered all-day support but she believes the school only plans to offer morning sessions, so parents would need to find childminders to fill in.\nRebecca Stanford-Durdan, who runs the St Michael's playgroup in Finedon, Northamptonshire, said she had always had a good relationship with her school but was stunned when it called her to a meeting in March to tell her it was terminating the contract to create its own nursery.\n\"I was quite upset - I didn't see it coming. I knew what the government were doing but I didn't think it would happen to us.\" Stanford-Durdan added the playgroup was lucky to find a local community centre to move to. \"I've come across other settings who have had to close,\" she said.\nRichard Freedman, chair of governors of Finedon infant school, said the school had been \"actively considering adding its own nursery but timing had not been right\" and that the decision to do so was \"not connected to the government's drive to create new places\". He expected there to be more overall provision in the town.\nSian, who runs a preschool in Surrey, was told in October that her lease was being cancelled.\n\"I thought they were going to extend our lease and then they said: 'No, we're getting rid because the government want all nurseries in school and we could get PS150,000 for it,'\" she said. The preschool has found another premises in a village nearby but she is having to pay rent on the new site and the school building while refurbishments are happening.\nA DfE spokesperson said: \"Expanding access to high-quality early years education where it's needed most, so every child gets the best start, is vital to delivering our plan for change. We continue to value the vital role of private and voluntary providers, who remain central to our childcare reforms, including through targeted funding like the PS100m childcare expansion capital grant.\"From September, we will be extending funded hours to 30 hours a week, saving parents up to PS7,500 a year as we also create thousands of places in new school-based nurseries. This expansion will help us get a record proportion of children school-ready, hitting key developmental targets.\"",
      "ml_hf_summary": "The UK government's initiative to expand early years education by creating 100,000+ nursery places has led to some schools evicting existing preschool providers operating on their premises. This is happening despite the government's intention to work alongside these private providers and address \"childcare deserts.\"  Over 15 preschools have been notified of eviction plans for the end of the summer term, with many facing difficulties finding alternative spaces due to limited funding and bureaucratic hurdles. The Early Years Alliance (EYA) expresses concern that this policy may negatively impact vulnerable families and existing private providers, potentially leading to closures in less affluent areas.  The government's decision to prioritize school-based nurseries over existing providers has sparked criticism from the EYA, who believe it undermines the role of private providers and could exacerbate childcare deserts. \n"

      "content": "Residents feel city is in decline and polls suggest Reform could take control of council from Labour next month\n\"You can't fix the system with the same hands that broke it,\" Richie Vallance shouted through a megaphone from his mobility scooter. \"Let's make Doncaster Doncaster again,\" he yelled at passersby in the city centre, who mostly politely ignored him.\nVallance is standing as an independent candidate for mayor in the local elections on 1 May, when all 55 seats on the city's council will also be up for grabs. The small South Yorkshire city is a key battleground that will be a test of Labour's resilience in the face of rising public support for Reform UK.\nNigel Farage's party is surging ahead in the polls and in Doncaster there is a good chance it will wrestle control from Labour, which has been in power for nearly 50 years. Last month, a poll conducted by Electoral Calculus for the Telegraph found Reform was expected to win 32 of the council's 55 seats.\n\"It's a beautiful town, with so much potential,\" said Vallance, who has some sympathies with Reform and previously explored standing for the party. \"I was all about Brexit,\" he said, \"and we need to deal with the immigration problem in Doncaster.\"\nImmigration was on the minds of lots of people in the city centre on Wednesday, with some saying they felt it had had a negative impact on the city, particularly when it came to asylum seekers, of whom there are 688 housed in Doncaster, according to Home Office figures.\n\"I know they've got to be put somewhere but Doncaster has changed and it's not for the better,\" one man said.\nThis sentiment is exactly what Reform is hoping to harness, and why Farage paid a visit to the city at the start of April in support of Alexander Jones, the party's mayoral candidate.\nWhile there was also disgust among some Doncaster residents at the idea of voting for Reform, Labour was not popular either. Most people, in one way or another, pointed to what they felt was decline in the city, blaming the cash-strapped council.\nIt is something the current mayor, Labour's Ros Jones, who has been in the directly elected post since 2013, is all too aware of, having battled under the weight of enormous budget cuts from central government.\nShe said: \"I have made incredibly difficult decisions in terms of council services over the years of austerity, protecting frontline services and keeping council tax low, with Doncaster having the lowest council tax in Yorkshire.\"\nThough Jones had some supporters on the streets of Doncaster - one couple said they were \"not unhappy\" with the council and called Farage a liar and a \"mini-Trump\" - she is also contending with the council's reputation.\nNear the start of her tenure, she pulled the local authority out of special measures after the tabloids called Doncaster the \"worst council in Britain\", and the label seems to have stuck.\nLabour could face a bigger brand-recognition problem in Doncaster as some of those out and about only vaguely recognised Keir Starmer's name. This might be cheering news for Reform except Farage's name did not necessarily ring bells either.\n\"Never heard of him,\" said Shelly, who was out in the Frenchgate shopping centre with her friends Siobhan and Jade.\n\"Was he in the Celebrity jungle?\" Jade asked. \"He seemed all right but I wouldn't know about his politics.\"\nThough they did not know Reform, the trio did broadly agree with the party's policies on immigration. \"We need to get back to British, not everybody else,\" Siobhan said. \"We shouldn't be fetching migrants when we can't even look after our own.\"\nShelly said: \"I daren't say owt because it sounds racist.\"\nThey felt people coming to the UK were getting better treatment than those born here, particularly because they were put up in hotels and given homes without having to work.\nThe UK has a legal duty to house asylum seekers, and paid work is forbidden under asylum rules. The women said they were not against this, they just wanted to see British people better looked after.\n\"It's a bleak future for the next generation,\" Siobhan said.\nThe issue for all parties is likely to be getting voters to the polls. Most people the Guardian spoke to in Doncaster on Wednesday lunchtime said they did not vote and had not known there was a local election happening at all.\n\"I don't do politics,\" one man said. \"Whoever's the prime minister, good luck to them.\"\nNaomi Nache, from Romania, and Michael Yip, from Scunthorpe, moved to Doncaster when they started working in an Amazon warehouse. They have plans to leave for a bigger city, citing a lack of things to do in Doncaster, particularly on the \"artistic side\".\nSafety was a big issue for Nache, who said she felt afraid to go out in the city on her own. \"It can be a bit scary. It doesn't feel safe. I wouldn't come to the town centre by myself,\" she said.\nVallance has campaigned on public safety and tackling antisocial behaviour, knowing something about the subject himself having received a criminal conviction in 2016 for dressing up as the \"Donny Klown\" in an effort to attract attention to societal problems.\n\"I scared a lot of people and I'm really sorry about what I did. I went about it the wrong way,\" Vallance said. \"I took the mask off many years ago. Now I want to show who the real clowns are.\"",

While Labour's mayor, Ros Jones, has faced criticism for budget cuts and a tarnished reputation, she maintains that she has prioritized frontline services and kept council tax low.

      "content": "Fears produce could be permanently devalued by price war, as it 'creates unrealistic expectations about costs'\nSupermarkets have been criticised for using vegetables as the latest weapon in their burgeoning price war, charging as little as 8p for a 2kg bag of potatoes in an attempt to lure shoppers over Easter.\nGrowers said they feared the massive discounts, which are also deployed at Christmas, could permanently devalue their produce.\nAsda and Aldi are charging 8p for a 2kg bag of potatoes and Tesco and Sainsbury's are charging 15p for loyalty card holders, compared with normal prices of about PS1.35 or as much as PS2.50 for branded Albert Bartlett spuds. Bags of carrots, broccoli and other vegetables and fruit including courgettes are also included in the promotions.\nThe president of the National Farmers' Union, Tom Bradshaw, said: \"While promotional activity can help driving sales, it's important that retailers take responsibility for their decisions to massively discount products and ensure it doesn't have long term impacts on the public's perception of true market value and production costs.\n\"As an industry we need to drive investment to deliver for future food security and the British people who truly value high quality, homegrown food. A crucial part of that is a fair and transparent market, where farmers and growers can get fair returns for the risk and capital invested.\"\nScott Walker, the head of trade body GB Potato, said: \"There is a concern that these prices does not in any way reflect the cost of production and if that puts the sense in consumers mind how much it costs to produce these foods that's a concern for the future.\"\nSupermarkets say they bear the cost of the discounts and the prices do not affect the amount paid to suppliers and farmers, adding that discounting can entice more shoppers to try fresh vegetables.\nAndrew Opie, the director of food and sustainability at the British Retail Consortium, a trade body that represents all the big supermarkets, said: \"Vegetables are a vital part of a balanced diet, and by providing discounts where they can, retailers are supporting healthy eating for all households. Retailers understand the importance of a strong supply chain and the need to offer farmers a fair price, while still offering great value for customers.\"\nHowever, Dale Robinson, the head of procurement at Riverford Organic Farmers, which charges PS18 each for its fruit and veg boxes including delivery, said heavy discounting undermined the true cost of food production as planting, growing, harvesting and transporting fresh produce could not be done sustainably at such low prices.\n\"While these deals might seem like a win for shoppers, they create unrealistic expectations about food costs and leave farmers struggling to cover even their most basic expenses.,\" he said.\nThe worries emerged as the vegetable industry wrestles with heavier costs including higher wages and employer national insurance contributions, as well new barriers to the import of vital supplies, such as young plants and seeds, as a result of Brexit.\nSign up to Business Today\nGet set for the working day - we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning\nafter newsletter promotion\nThe sunny and warm start to the year has been good for planting out crops, but Walker said growers in some parts of the country had already been warned there was insufficient water for them to draw water for irrigation this year and so they would have to be reliant on rainfall.\n\"It's been fantastic but that is just the start,\" he said. \"We have just got to hope the British weather plays ball.\"\nThe amount of land given over to growing potatoes in Great Britain has decreased by 20,000 hectares (49,421 acres) to about 100,000 in the past five years as the cost of machinery and other requirements to manage the root crop have risen amid less certainty over harvests because of increasingly unreliable weather driven by the climate crisis.\n\"There is a pretty poor risk and reward situation,\" Walker said.",
      "ml_hf_summary": "Supermarkets are offering heavily discounted prices on vegetables, such as potatoes and carrots, during Easter promotions.  Prices range from 8 pence for a 2kg bag of potatoes at Asda and Aldi to 15 pence for Tesco and Sainsbury's loyalty card holders. This has raised concerns among growers that these low prices may permanently devalue produce and create unrealistic expectations about food costs. The National Farmers’ Union (NFU) emphasizes the need for fair market value and investment in sustainable farming practices, while the British Retail Consortium argues that discounts encourage healthy eating and support farmers.  The vegetable industry faces challenges including higher production costs, Brexit-related import restrictions, and unreliable weather patterns. \n"

He will probably do so again, but we will have to get various permission from the GLA and the police. It might be different from last time but we are confident that a lot of people will want to come out on to the streets and show their disgust.\"\nThe demonstrations will be a test for the police even with tougher laws available to crack down on protests and activism.\nGardner said: \"We want it to be a defiant but joyful celebration of all the things that Trump hates, such as the rights of LGBTQ people, the rights of women, the rights of migrants and refugees, union power and workers' rights. It will celebrate every marginalised group in society.\"\nThe demonstrators will also target the tech and business leaders that have backed Trump. Gardner said: \"If we had one strapline it would be 'Stop Trump and fight the oligarchy'. We are against empowering the super-rich, including treating Gaza like real estate and chumming up to Putin and the tech billionaires who are looking to the UK for tax breaks.\"\nSign up to First Edition\nOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what's happening and why it matters\nafter newsletter promotion\nGiant papier-mache models of the tech leaders that appeared at Trump's inauguration including Jeff Bezos, Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk will make an appearance at the protests, Gardner said.

Gardner predicted that the protesters will vent their anger at Starmer as well as Trump.\nGardner said: \"Starmer should be shamed by these demonstrations. The whole country has been embarrassed by his display of rolling over like a pathetic poodle to whatever Trump does. Starmer's approach of sucking up is not getting us anywhere.\"\nShe added: \"We are looking for anyone who has a fun idea to come forward, because we really want to show Trump what we think of him.\"",

They anticipate larger demonstrations than those during his 2019 state visit, with up to 250,000 people expected to participate. The coalition will use a blimp featuring Trump dressed in a nappy as a focal point of their protest, and they are seeking permission from the London mayor to fly it over the capital.  The protests aim to express opposition to Trump's policies on LGBTQ rights, women's rights, migrants' rights, union power, and workers' rights, while also targeting tech and business leaders who have supported him.

      "content": "Proxy advisory firms back plans for hikes in maximum payouts 18 months after removal of banker bonus cap\nUK banks are expected to win approval for massive pay increases in the coming weeks after convincing influential shareholder advisers that hiking maximum payouts for chief executives by more than 40% would give them a competitive edge.\nISS and Glass Lewis, two prominent proxy advisory services that suggest how shareholders should vote on company policies at annual meeting, have backed NatWest, Barclays and HSBC over plans to substantially increase potential payouts after the removal of the UK banker bonus cap in late 2023.\nNatWest Group is proposing a 43% increase in the maximum for its chief executive, Paul Thwaite, giving him the chance to earn up to PS7.7m for a single year's work. Meanwhile, his Barclays counterpart, CS Venkatakrishnan, could earn up to PS14.3m, a 45% hike, if shareholders approve a new pay policy next month. HSBC is suggesting a 43% increase for Georges Elhedery, for a maximum payout of about PS15m.\nGlass Lewis and ISS said shareholders should be \"mindful\" of the significant increases, but sided with remuneration committees who argued payouts needed to compete with that offered at rival banks including on Wall Street. That includes JP Morgan, where the chief executive, Jamie Dimon, was paid $39m (PS29m) last year.\n\"Against these peers, Barclays' pay proposals are well below market,\" ISS said in its report ahead of the bank's AGM next month. That could make it hard to recruit talented bankers, banks claimed.\nISS said it recognised there was an \"ongoing discussion on the competitiveness of executive pay in the UK market, especially for companies with a global presence and significant US exposure\".\nThe London Stock Exchange and City lobby groups including the influential UK capital markets industry taskforce (CMIT) have claimed higher pay is key to luring top talent and US businesses to Britain.\nBut NatWest, which does not have an international presence, has also secured the backing of proxy advisers. \"We recognise that the company's incentive opportunity is currently lower than that of its UK banking peers, as it remains the only UK bank that had not previously sought shareholder approval to raise the variable pay cap from 100% to 200% of fixed pay,\" Glass Lewis said.\nNatWest is expected to shake off its remaining government shareholding and fully return to private hands within weeks, making it easier to raise pay.\nThe decision by ISS and Glass Lewis to back the pay increases mark a significant shift in shareholder sentiment, and has also been coupled with a backlash against environmental, social and governance (ESG) standards.\nThe focus on ESG prompted a raft of shareholder rebellions over pay in the early 2010s, including at HSBC and Barclays, as investors demanded a more measured approach by company executives after the 2008 financial crisis.\nSign up to Business Today\nGet set for the working day - we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning\nafter newsletter promotion\nBut anxieties over the UK's global standing post-Brexit, as well as Donald Trump's crackdown on progressive policies such as diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI), have led to a significant social shift in corporate culture. ISS has already bowed to pressure over DEI, having said in February it would not recommend voting against any US board members for failing to meet gender and ethnicity leadership targets.\nGlass Lewis and ISS have also faced pressure from high-profile chief executives including Dimon, who last year said the proxy advisers had too much sway over shareholders, while criticising their foreign ownership structures. Glass Lewis and ISS are owned by Canadian and German firms, respectively.\n\"I question whether American corporate governance should be determined by for-profit international institutions that may have their own strong feelings about what constitutes good corporate governance,\" the JP Morgan chief executive said.\nNatWest will hold its annual meeting on 23 April and HSBC will host its shareholder meeting on 2 May. Barclays' is scheduled for 7 May.",
      "ml_hf_summary": "Proxy advisory firms ISS and Glass Lewis have supported UK banks' proposals to significantly increase CEO pay, exceeding 40% increases in maximum payouts. This follows the removal of the UK banker bonus cap in late 2023.  NatWest, Barclays, and HSBC are seeking to attract top talent by offering higher compensation compared to their peers on Wall Street, with potential payouts for CEOs reaching up to £7.7 million, £14.3 million, and £15 million respectively. These increases have been backed by remuneration committees who argue that competitive pay is necessary to attract talent in a global market.  The decision marks a shift in shareholder sentiment, particularly as it comes alongside a backlash against ESG standards. \n"

Previous events included a \"No Kings Day\" on President's Day, 17 February, a theme adopted before Trump referred to himself as a king in a social media post days later.\nOrganizers have called for 11 million people to participate in the latest rallies, representing 3.5% of the US population.\nSuch a figure would likely the surpass the numbers who took part in the \"Hands Off\" rallies staged on 5 April, when 1,200 demonstrations were staged across the US to register opposition to Trump's assault on government agencies and institutions, spearheaded by the president's chief lieutenant, the tech billionaire Elon Musk and his unofficial \"department of government efficiency\" (Doge) unit.\nIndivisible, the progressive movement behind the \"Hands Off\" events said it was it was seeking to send a message to opposition politicians and ordinary voters that vocal resistance to Trump's policies was essential. It also said it was seeking to build momentum that would lead to further and larger protests.\nHeather Dunn, a spokesperson for 50501, said the goal of Saturday's protests is \"to protect our democracy against the rise of authoritarianism under the Trump administration\".\nShe called the group a \"pro-democracy, pro-constitution, anti-executive overreach, nonviolent grassroots movement\" that was nonpartisan.\n\"We have registered Democrats, registered independents and registered Republicans all marching because they all believe in America, because they all believe in a fair government that puts people before profits,\" she told the Washington Post.\nSign up to This Week in Trumpland\nA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administration\nafter newsletter promotion\nAcademics who have tracked the slide of democracy into authoritarianism say protests can be part of a wider of strategy to reverse the trend.\n\"Oppositions to authoritarian governments have to use multiple channels always,\" said Steven Levitsky, a political scientist at Harvard University and co-author, with Daniel Ziblatt, of How Democracies Die. \"They have to use the courts where those are available. They have to use the ballot box when that's available, and they have to use the streets when necessary - that can shape media framing and media discourse, which is very, very important.\"\nIn Washington DC on Saturday, protests are scheduled to take place outside vice-president JD Vance's home, on the grounds of the Washington Naval Observatory, as well as in Lafayette Square. A march is planned starting nearby the George Washington monument that will head towards the White House in support of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran man with US protected status wrongly deported to El Salvador from Maryland, according to court rulings.",

The ceiling above her is full of holes, blackened by years of cooking fires. Manqele, 64, isn't sure how many people live in the house's seven rooms. There are no utilities, the landlord is absent and she hasn't paid rent in years, she says through a translator. The occupants share a portable toilet provided and cleaned by an NGO, plus one outdoor tap with the house next door, which has no roof.\nManqele's home in the inner city district of Berea is emblematic of Johannesburg's downtown, which was progressively abandoned by wealthy people, businesses and government from the 1980s. Hundreds of buildings left empty by landlords are now overcrowded, and the area is notorious for crime.\nBeyond the inner city, the shine is coming off the City of Gold, with growing numbers of residents dissatisfied with basic services such as water and roads, according to the latest quality of life survey by the Gauteng City-Region Observatory. In March South Africa's president Cyril Ramaphosa criticised the environment as being \"not pleasing\" and set up a presidential working group to \"revive\" Johannesburg before it hosts the G20 summit in November.\nMeanwhile, artists and businesspeople are rallying to defend their city. \"It's always hustling - there's an energy,\" says Stephen du Preez, who manages 11 business improvement districts and volunteers with Jozi My Jozi, a business coalition launched in 2023 to spruce up downtown. \"They're friendly; they're damn good people.\"\nThere are now about 140 businesses donating to Jozi My Jozi, with 75m rand (PS3m) spent in two years on projects such as installing 613 solar-powered streetlights. The initiative, which Du Preez says works with local communities rather than gentrifying them, is also expanding to the former black-only township of Soweto.\nPrevious efforts to regenerate inner-city districts, such as the trendy area of Maboneng, have excluded those living there, says Edward Molopi of the Socio-Economic Rights Institute of South Africa (Seri), an NGO supporting Manqele and her neighbours. He says these efforts often involve evicting residents then raising rents: \"Is there a place for the poor in the inner city? Many of these initiatives will answer in the negative.\nJohannesburg is a highly unequal city in the world's most unequal country. The new business district, Sandton, is known as \"Africa's richest square mile\". An estimated 1million trees were planted when the city was built on Highveld grassland in 1886, forming one of the world's largest urban forests. But the townships, created by the apartheid regime in the mid-20th century to force non-white people to the city's margins, are far less lush.\nAt the city's birth, when gold was discovered, black male migrant workers lived in mine camps in the south, white \"Randlords\" in northern hilltop mansions, and more mixed communities between. \"There were these social fractures in the city at the very beginning,\" says Noor Nieftagodien, a history professor at the University of the Witwatersrand.\nWhile Johannesburg's problems have always hit the poorest the hardest, middle-class complaints are growing louder as issues such as water outages spread to the suburbs. Political instability - the city has had eight mayors in the past four years - and corruption are often blamed.\nThe inner city's issues culminated in tragedy in 2023, when 77 people were killed in a fire at 80 Albert Road, an overcrowded apartment building owned by the city. An inquiry blamed neglect by local authorities and the provincial premier pledged to act on its recommendations.\nThe city government is implementing a \"bad buildings strategy\" to deal with \"hijacked\" buildings, spokesperson Virgil James says, noting there are court orders \"to evacuate the occupiers to a temporary emergency accommodation\" from six buildings.\nIn Manhattan Court, a 108-room apartment building on a bustling shopping street, residents are collectively paying 25,000 rand a month to the city for services and to try to secure ownership of their homes, says Noma Qwele, a residents' committee member who has lived there since 1986.\nThey also pay for maintenance and security, but they still don't know who the building's owner is after it was sold in an auction, Qwele says, adding: \"The building is for us. It's our home.\"\nSifiso Zuma of the Inner City Foundation, an NGO supporting Manhattan Court, says: \"If you are poor, they don't care about you. Because tThose people who are living in occupied buildings, they are willing to pay for basic services, but the city - it doesn't want to talk to them.\"\nIn Fordsburg, another inner city district, the outer wall of the Bag Factory glows with an orange mural by artist Levy Pooe. The studios, founded in 1991, are home to nine long-term artists and six younger ones on bursaries.\n\"It's always been a very vibrant city,\" says Ndaya Ilunga, who was born in Johannesburg in 1995 after her parents fled the Democratic Republic of Congo, gesturing amid her vivid Afrofuturist works. \"I feel like I'm now part of that, those people who create that energy.\"",
      "ml_hf_summary": "Johannesburg, South Africa is facing challenges with basic services, corruption, and social unrest ahead of the G20 summit in November. The city's inner-city areas have seen a decline in residents due to abandoned buildings and overcrowding, leading to issues like crime and lack of utilities.  The Gauteng City-Region Observatory reports declining quality of life surveys, while initiatives like Jozi My Jozi are attempting to revitalize the downtown area through community engagement and business support. However, concerns remain about gentrification efforts that exclude existing residents and exacerbate inequality. The city's history is marked by racial segregation during apartheid, leading to a stark divide between wealthier areas like Sandton and poorer townships.  Tragic incidents like the 2023 fire at 80 Albert Road highlight the urgency of addressing housing issues and neglect within the city.  Despite these challenges, artists and residents are working to preserve the city's vibrancy and address its social inequalities. \n"

      "content": "After the famous physicist fled Germany in 1933, his cousin Robert moved his family to Italy, where they thought they had found safety. Then, the day before liberation, Nazis smashed down their front door ...\nEarly on the morning of 3 August 1944, a unit of heavily armed German soldiers arrived at the Villa Il Focardo outside Florence.\nThey didn't knock. They didn't ring the bell. They simply smashed through the front door, marched in and started shouting for the villa's owner, Robert Einstein, cousin of the world-famous scientist Albert Einstein.\nRobert and Albert had grown up together in Munich, Germany, in the 1880s and 1890s. For 11 years they had lived in the same house. You could say they were brother-cousins. Their fathers, Jakob and Hermann Einstein, were in business together, running an electrification company. Over the years, they had brought electric light to beer halls, town squares and cafes.\nIn 1894, the Einstein company failed to win a large contract and went bankrupt. The two families moved to Milan and started again. When this business also went bust, the brothers parted ways but the cousins remained close. Robert stayed in Italy, qualified as an engineer and married Nina Mazzetti, a priest's daughter from the north. In the 1920s, they moved to a small apartment in Rome and began building a life.\nThis was around the time that Benito Mussolini and his National Fascist Party (PNF) took power. The fascists were, at this point, not particularly antisemitic and Jews were as likely to be party members as the rest of the population. For his part, the Jewish Robert Einstein did not join the fascists, but as a businessman he was sympathetic towards their investment in public infrastructure and modernisation of the government.\nMeanwhile, Albert Einstein had returned to Germany and published his paper on relativity. In 1922, he was awarded the Nobel prize and was the most famous scientist in the world.\nAs it happens, I have a personal connection to the Einsteins. Our two families knew each other in Berlin in the 1920s. My grandmother used to tell a story from when she was a child. One day, Albert Einstein and his wife came for dinner at the family's apartment on Kaiserallee near the Kurfurstendamm. She recalled peering through the keyhole of the dining room door and seeing that the great scientist was wearing house slippers, confirming rumours of his forgetful nature.\nAfter the meal, her father, Alfred Alexander, escorted Albert to the salon to take coffee, intending to quiz him about the theory of relativity. But when he climbed into bed later that night, Alfred confessed to his wife that he and his guest had become so engrossed in discussing the latest detective novels that he had forgotten to ask.\nThe two men also had a professional relationship. My great-grandfather was the Einstein family doctor. On 27 April 1926, Albert Einstein wrote a letter thanking my great-grandfather for the treatment he had provided to his terminally ill uncle and aunt: \"Dear and esteemed Dr Alexander!\" Albert said. \"Words cannot express the good you have done for my family.\" Having detailed the specifics of the treatment, he ended with a sentence that imagined a tactile link between the two families: \"Clasping your hand in sincere gratitude, A Einstein.\"\nNeither Albert nor Alfred had a sense of the horror their families would soon face.\nIn 1934, Robert and Nina Einstein were still living in Rome when Nina's brother asked them for help. His wife had died and he was struggling to look after their seven-year-old twins. Robert and Nina had two girls of their own (Luce, who was 17, and Cici, who was eight), but they agreed to take in their two nieces.\nThe Rome apartment was now too crowded. Robert and Nina shared a love of nature and decided the time was right to move to the countryside. They found a villa outside Florence called Il Focardo. It had a peach orchard, vines and olive trees. Perhaps most importantly, it came with 10 contadini, or farmers, who would help manage the estate. It was paradise.\nIn May 1938, Adolf Hitler was invited to Florence by Mussolini. Desperate to impress his visitor, the Italian leader spent vast sums cleaning up the buildings, parks and streets, then gave the Fuhrer a pomp-filled guided tour of the city. Travelling in a 20-car motorcade, they were cheered on by tens of thousands of flag-waving Italians, right arms raised to the sky in the fascist salute. The two men appeared to bond during this trip.\nSix months later, on 11 November 1938, to the shock of Italian Jews, Mussolini announced the introduction of racial laws (similar to the Nazis' Nuremberg laws). The legislation was approved by parliament and signed into law by King Vittorio Emanuele III. Jewish children were forbidden to attend public schools and universities. Jews could no longer work in banks, insurance companies or local government. They could not marry non-Jews, serve in the army or be PNF members.\nIn practice, these laws were intermittently enforced, dependent on the whims of the local police and party officials. As a result, the Einsteins' lives at Il Focardo were little affected. Luce continued to attend medical school in Florence. Cici and her cousins went to the local high school, while Robert and Nina managed the estate.\nThis sense of relative calm changed in the autumn of 1943, when the German army swept through northern Italy and occupied Florence and its surrounding area. On 1 December, Mussolini's minister of the interior, Guido Buffarini Guidi, announced on national radio Police Order Number 5, including this command: all Jews were to be rounded up and put in concentration camps.\nOver the next seven months, more than 8,000 Jews were arrested, amounting to 20% of the Italian Jewish population. The roundups, or razzia as they were called in Italy, were carried out by German SS and police forces, supported by Italian fascists.\nRobert and Nina were still living at Il Focardo with their two daughters and two nieces. They had been joined by Nina's sister Seba and a third niece, Anna Maria, the daughter of another of Nina's sisters whose family thought she would be safer in the country.\nOver the next days and weeks, Robert and his family watched in horror as Jews across Tuscany were arrested and put on trains to Auschwitz. It was too late for the Einsteins to flee. With the railway stations, airports and border crossings carefully monitored, the Nazis and their Italian partners made it impossible to leave.\nBut the Einsteins still thought they were safe. They were tucked away in the villa, far off the beaten track. Nina and the other female family members were Christian and therefore would not be a target of the roundups. And while Robert was Jewish, he was an Italian citizen and much respected locally. It was unlikely that anyone would give him away.\nThis dark period underlines another connection between my family and the Einsteins. We also experienced the horrors of fascist persecution. My family was German Jewish. My grandmother was thrown out of Heidelberg University because of her religion. Her father had to close his business, as Jews were not allowed to practise medicine. The Nazis stole our family's precious house by the lake outside Berlin.\nMost of my family were able to get out of Nazi Germany, including my grandmother and her parents. They were very grateful when they found refuge in England. But five of my relatives were not so lucky. They were still in Berlin when, in 1943, the Nazis organised their latest roundup. All were murdered in the Holocaust.\nBy the third week of July 1944, the allies were quickly moving up through Italy from the south. At night, planes could be heard buzzing overhead. There was talk that Florence might fall in a few weeks.\nIt was the height of the Tuscan summer. The sun beat down unrelentingly. The contadini were working in Il Focardo's orchards, harvesting the peaches. And it was then that Robert heard there was a German unit looking for him. According to the local priest and an owner of a nearby estate, the soldiers had specifically mentioned he was the cousin of Albert Einstein.\nWhy would the Germans want to track down Albert Einstein's relative in Italy? A decade earlier, in 1933, the great scientist had fled Germany when he learned the Nazis wanted to kill him. This was hardly a secret. Newspapers across Europe carried front page stories stating that Hitler wanted Einstein assassinated. London's Daily Herald announced \"Price placed on Einstein's head\", adding this was valued at PS1,000 - equivalent to about half a million pounds today.\nFearing for his life, Albert had fled to England, where he holed up for a few days in Norfolk. He then took a boat with his wife to the US and moved into a house in Princeton, New Jersey.\nIf anything, Hitler's hatred of Albert Einstein had intensified over the intervening years. The scientist had very publicly criticised the Nazi regime in the newspapers and raised money for the war effort. He had also provided support to the US military (given its secrecy, it is unlikely that Hitler knew of Einstein's involvement with the Manhattan Project).\nBy the summer of 1944, he was, if anything, considered by the Nazi regime to be even more of an enemy than in 1933. The threat of assassination was still very real.\nThe problem, for the Nazis, was that living in the US, the famous physicist was well beyond their reach. The same was true of his nearest relatives. Albert's wife, stepdaughter, sister and eldest son were all living in the US, while his first wife and youngest son were in neutral Switzerland.\nThis left his cousin, Robert, as his closest relative living in Nazi-occupied Europe.\nAfter hearing the Germans were looking for him, Robert and Nina decided he must go into hiding. It was agreed Nina and the girls would stay at the villa; after all, they were Christian, what harm could come to them?\nSo it was that, in late July 1944, Robert kissed his family goodbye and headed up the rocky track towards the woods behind the villa. There he would remain for the next two weeks, sleeping in a different spot each night.\nSign up to Inside Saturday\nThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Coming to see him one day with supplies, Nina confirmed this. She had heard on the BBC radio that the allies were 20 miles south of Florence. They might be in the city later that week. The prospect of liberation after years of war was thrilling.\nThis is how things stood when, at 7am on 3 August 1944, the group of heavily armed Germans smashed through the front door of the villa. Alerted by the noise, Nina ran to see what was happening. She found seven soldiers standing in the front hallway. She was soon joined by her two daughters, sister and three nieces. Having lived for a while with her husband in Munich, Nina could speak a few words in German. She demanded to know what was going on. How dare they barge into her house like this?\nThe intruders were led by a captain who looked to be in his early 30s. He was of average height, had a gaunt face, short-cropped blond hair and wore round metal glasses. Unlike the other soldiers who carried machine guns, the captain had only a pistol which was tucked into a holster on his belt. Ignoring Nina's umbrage, he demanded to know the whereabouts of the patrone. Where was the cousin of Albert Einstein?\nNina didn't answer. The German asked again, his voice rising. She maintained her silence. When the captain looked to the others, they also kept quiet.\nFrustrated, the captain ordered the seven women to be taken into the cellar. They were pushed along a narrow corridor, then through an open metal door and down some steep wooden steps. Once they were downstairs, the door was closed and locked with a clank.\nOver the next few hours, the hostages followed what was going on upstairs. They heard the shuffle of boots overhead: it seemed the soldiers were exploring the villa's every nook and cranny. Later came the sound of corks popping, followed by the clinking of glasses, cheering and laughter. After that, there was the rumble of large pieces of furniture being dragged across the floor and the unmistakable sound of a ping-pong game being played. By mid-afternoon, things had calmed down. Perhaps the soldiers were resting?\nRobert, meanwhile, was still in the woods. He had seen the German soldiers arrive in their military vehicles. He was terrified but paralysed by indecision. Should he stay out of sight or run to the villa and protect his family? If he did the latter, what then? He was unarmed and alone. In the end he decided to stick with the plan. Given the allies were quickly approaching, surely the soldiers would not stick around for long. After stealing supplies and anything else of value, they would move on.\nBack in the cellar, the quiet was pierced by the creak of the metal door, followed by the sound of boots coming down the stairs. \"Raus!\" a soldier screamed. \"Raus! Raus!\"\nNina was taken to the living room for questioning, while the other six women were locked in an upstairs bedroom. The captain demanded that she disclose her husband's whereabouts and sensing she had to give him something, Nina said she sometimes met her husband in the woods, but she never knew where he would be. To find him, she called his name. Satisfied he was at last getting somewhere, the captain told two of his men to escort Nina outside to search for Robert.\nBy now it was dark, but their way was illuminated by a full moon. As they walked up the rocky track towards the woods, Nina called her husband's name.\n\"Roberto,\" she cried, \"Roberto.\" When there was no response, they continued on. She called again. \"Roberto! Roberto.\" Again there was nothing.\nWhen Robert had first gone into hiding, they had discussed exactly this scenario. If Nina came looking for him at a time they had not previously agreed, he was to stay hidden, so this is exactly what he did. He heard his wife call for him, but did not come out.\nAfter 30 minutes, the soldiers realised their efforts were futile. They returned to the villa and informed the captain. Furious, he told his men to bring down Nina's daughters, Luce and Cici. He would press them for details. And if they still refused to help, he would be forced to take drastic measures.\nRobert was standing in the woods when he heard a noise that filled him with terror. It was the sound of machine guns firing. He started to run.\nA few minutes later, he bumped into his nieces and sister-in-law, who were fleeing the villa. Robert was desperate to know what had happened. Where were his wife and daughters? Were they OK?\nThey told him the terrible news: Nina, Luce and Cici had been murdered. Their bodies were back at the villa. The Germans had set the building on fire. Robert screamed in anguish and collapsed to the ground.\nAt almost exactly the same time that Robert heard the machine-gun fire, Germans blew up five of the bridges across the Arno River in Florence. They then retreated to the north. Early next morning, 4 August 1944, New Zealand soldiers arrived in Florence. The city was liberated.\nSix weeks later, an American war crimes investigator sent a letter to Albert Einstein informing him that his cousin's family had been murdered in Italy. The news was devastating.\nA year later, Albert would hear more terrible news from Italy. Overwhelmed by guilt and grief, Robert had taken an overdose of sleeping pills. He died in a hospital in Florence on 13 July 1945.\nAfter the war, my family lost contact with the Einsteins. They were living in the US and Switzerland; we were in London. The only remaining evidence of a connection was the letter from Albert Einstein to my great-grandfather.\nBut contact was made again when I met Robert Einstein's niece, Anna Maria. Though in her 90s, she still had a clear memory of the dreadful events of August 1944.\nShe told me it was the worst day of her life; she was still terrorised by what happened.\nShe was also confident about why the murder had taken place. It had been ordered at the very highest level in the Nazi regime. Robert had been targeted because he was the cousin of Albert Einstein. And as Robert was not available, they had brutally murdered his wife and daughters. It was a vendetta.\n The Einstein Vendetta by Thomas Harding is published by Michael Joseph at PS22.

      "content": "The progressive democrat from Queens is the son of a famous film-maker and poised to take on front-runner Andrew Cuomo\nCan a 33-year-old cricket-playing socialist, who wants to freeze rent, make city transport free and once aspired to be a rapper win an already turbulent election to become the next mayor of New York?\nZohran Mamdani, a democratic socialist and state assembly member in Queens, has been the surprise package in the Democratic primary and is now poised to take on the frontrunner in the race, ex-state governor Andrew Cuomo, who is mounting a political comeback after being forced from office in the face of a series of sexual harassment claims.\nA recent poll of Democratic voters placed Cuomo at 64%, supported mainly by older New Yorkers, and Mamdani at 36%. But with scandal-plagued incumbent Eric Adams sitting out the primary- he may run as an independent - the Ugandan-born Mamdani is in with a chance under a new ranked-choice voting system.\n\"Zohran is breaking away as a clear second place and the alternative to the disgraced ex-governor Andrew Cuomo whose campaign is a house of cards,\" Mamdani spokesperson Andrew Epstein told the Gothamist news site last week.\nHe added that the campaign has been successful so far by \"being everywhere all of the time,\" with more than 10,000 volunteers knocking on more than 100,000 doors, and by pushing out a platform of affordability, of rent freezes, free metro transport and city-run grocery stores - as well as the creation of a department of community safety to invest in citywide mental health programs and crisis response.\nMamdani's emergence as a viable candidate comes as another New York Democrat Socialist, congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, currently on a packed-out \"Fighting Oligarchy\" tour of the US, is being touted as the new face of the national party.\nMamdani \"represents the city of the future - a more Asian city, a more Muslim city, and what could be a more leftwing city,\" says Democrat campaign veteran Hank Sheinkopf.\nWith New York City containing about 800,000 Muslims, with 350,000 believed to be registered to vote, this could be the year that they show their power. \"Every group shows its power in New York at some point because urban power in the US is all about competition for resources,\" Sheinkopf adds.\nMamdani is the son of Mira Nair, the Academy Award nominated film director of Salaam Bombay!; his father, Mahmood Mamdani, is a professor at Columbia who studies colonialism. Around the family dinner table they would discuss Darfur and other political topics. Before running for office, Mamdani worked as a counsellor, a rapper under the name \"Mr. Cardamom\" and as a cricketer.\nAs a lawmaker, he's introduced a bill to eliminate tax exemptions for the city's biggest universities, Columbia and NYU, arguing that the tax funds should go to underfunded public universities; and has said there is a \"ceiling\" on the power of representation in identity politics because \"people cannot feed themselves and their family on someone looking like them\".\nWhen the Observer caught up with him at an anti-Tesla protest, he said \"it was important that when we turn the page on Elon Musk, we also turn the page on all those who empowered and emboldened the accumulation of this kind of wealth through public policy and public subsidy\".\nMamdani said New Yorkers \"have a role to play in fighting back against the wealthiest man in the world, who has purchased the president of the United States. It's critically important that we do so, and we show ourselves standing alongside New Yorkers from all walks of life who are saying that this cannot happen on our watch and our dime.\"\nSign up to Headlines US\nGet the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morning\nafter newsletter promotion\nBut key to Mamdani's candidacy may be that he's a good communicator, appearing in comedy clubs, grocery stores, diving into the freezing Atlantic on New Year's Day to illustrate his rent freeze proposal and talking to New Yorkers about why they voted for Trump; and going virtually anywhere to meet young voters that, as Gothamist noted, \"need a jolt to stop doomscrolling\".\nIn short, he's on a mission, alongside Ocasio-Cortez, to revive the Democrats as the Trump presidency marks 100 days in office next week.\nBut New York is also home to the largest Jewish population outside Israel, and Mamdani has faced criticism for accusing Israel of committing American-funded genocide in Gaza. Cuomo, a moderate Democrat, has gone to great lengths to portray antisemitism as a central campaign issue, calling it \"the most serious and the most important issue\" in New York , and portraying himself as a \"hyper aggressive supporter of Israel and proud of it\".\nMamdani has the capacity to win, says Sheinkopf, but his anti-Israel stance could be a problem: \"Is Mamdani's run a worthwhile demonstration of how healthy a democracy is? Yes. But he's got to convince people his behaviour is within the bounds of what [they] consider appropriate.\"",
      "ml_hf_summary": "Zohran Mamdani, a Democratic socialist and state assembly member from Queens, is challenging Andrew Cuomo for the mayoral nomination in New York City.  Mamdani's campaign has been successful due to extensive door-to-door canvassing and a platform focused on affordability, including rent freezes, free public transportation, and city-run grocery stores. He faces an uphill battle against Cuomo, who enjoys strong support from older voters, but Mamdani is gaining traction in the ranked-choice voting system.  Mamdani's background includes work as a counselor, rapper, and cricketer, and he has proposed policies such as eliminating tax exemptions for universities. His campaign has been bolstered by his ability to connect with young voters and engage in public outreach.

      "content": "Appraisal of international public affairs leaders warned companies against aligning with 'polarizing' Trump ally\nAssociating with the Donald Trump administration's multibillionaire adviser Elon Musk and misusing artificial intelligence are among the most surefire ways for companies to damage their brands, a new survey of more than 100 international public affairs leaders found.\nThose findings stem from an appraisal conducted by the Global Risk Advisory Council, which was chaired by the head of the US Small Business Administration during Joe Biden's presidency, Isabel Guzman.\nIn a statement, Brett Bruen of the Global Situation Room, the Washington DC-based public affairs firm that commissioned the survey, said the council's \"reputation risk index\" contains an \"unambiguous warning\" for chief executive officers. \"If you squander stakeholder and consumer goodwill on these issues, it won't be coming back anytime soon,\" said Bruen, before calling on companies to \"slow down\" and \"make a distinction between transitory and tectonic transitions\".\nNearly 30% of a 117-member group hailing from 17 different countries and 58 industries - among them former heads of state and US officials - indicated that aligning oneself with Musk, or being targeted by him, generated the strongest likelihood possible of being thrust under heightened scrutiny.\nThe world's richest person - whose holdings include the aerospace company SpaceX, the electrical vehicle manufacturer Tesla and the social media platform X - donated part of his wealth to Trump's successful run for a second presidency in November. After Trump returned to the Oval Office in January, Musk has overseen brutal federal budget and staffing cuts overseen by the president's so-called \"department of government efficiency\" (Doge), giving him what Guzman has described as a \"controversial omnipresence in the media landscape\".\nThat observation falls in line with some public opinion polling that has suggested strong disapproval of the work Musk has done for Trump. A Quinnipiac University survey released in March which showed 60% of voters look down on the way that the businessman and Doge \"are dealing with workers employed by the federal government\". Stock in Tesla slumped amid the backlash. And there were subsequently reports that Musk would gradually shift away from his prominent place within the Trump administration.\n\"The impact of association with influential figures in today's heavily divided environment cannot be understated, especially with a deeply polarizing leader like ... Musk,\" Guzman wrote in a summary of the index's findings.\nYet an even greater threat to brands were earning stories that feature \"creating deepfakes, misinformation, biased decision-making or unethical applications that cause harm or manipulate public perception\", the survey said. Attracting that kind of coverage was reportedly viewed \"as the most likely to gain negative online news attention\", the survey added.\nAn unnamed council member reportedly said: \"AI, if not understood or managed in companies, can have an incredible trickle-down effect that may not be reversible.\" One of the group's experts noted that organizations these days need to regard AI policies as equally standard to those that account for more mundane aspects of their operations.\nRolling back diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives aiming \"to ensure fair treatment and full participation for all individuals\" was labeled brands' third top risk. The Trump administration has aggressively moved to eliminate such measures within the government, military and beyond, including at Harvard, where the White House recently axed more than $2bn in federal research funding after the university refused to end DEI programs, one of several demands from the president.\nSign up to Business Today\nGet set for the working day - we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning\nafter newsletter promotion\nAnticompetitive practices and facing allegations of defamation round out the top five reputational risks flagged by the first edition of a survey planned for quarterly publication.\n\"This data is not just numbers; it indicates the complex communications challenges facing organizations constantly,\" wrote Guzman, adding the committee's members suspect that reputational threats are bound to only escalate in the short term.\nOther members of the council that produced the survey include Iceland's former foreign affairs minister Thordis Kolbrun Reykfjord Gylfadottir; Bank of Ireland public affairs head Paul O'Brien; DoorDash's global head of public affairs Taylor Bennett; American Association of Exporters and Importers president Eugene Laney; and Maria Toler, the founder of SteelSky Ventures, a venture capital fund focused on women's healthcare.",
      "ml_hf_summary": "A survey conducted by the Global Risk Advisory Council found that aligning with controversial figures like Elon Musk or engaging in unethical AI practices poses significant reputational risks for companies. Nearly 30% of surveyed international public affairs leaders indicated that associating with Musk significantly increases scrutiny, likely due to his close ties to former President Trump and his controversial actions.  The survey also highlighted the dangers of misinformation, deepfakes, biased decision-making, and unethical AI applications as major reputational risks.  These risks were ranked higher than anticompetitive practices, defamation allegations, and rolling back diversity initiatives, according to the council's findings. The survey suggests that these reputational threats are likely to intensify in the near future. \n"

Even if it decided to identify as a blunt for the purposes of this celebration, it would remain objectively, provably and demonstratively a cigar.\"\nIt was a typical response from the 59-year-old multimillionaire creator of the Harry Potter franchise, who has over recent years regularly utilised social media in her support of women-only spaces, and who has been a vocal and financial supporter of For Women Scotland, having donated PS70,000 to the group's crowdfunding for the legal challenge that culminated in Wednesday's ruling.\nThe writer has evolved from celebrated laureate of children's literature to a fearless figurehead for gender-critical campaigners: someone willing to have battles on X in particular, where she is something of a lightning rod, who fights fire with fire, and seemingly cannot be cowed.\nSupporters will say Rowling's financial contribution has been important, though point out the lesser sums donated by hundreds of other women to the crowdfunding were equally so. Her vocal support, however, has been of even greater consequence. They admire her doggedness, her clear-sightedness as an uncompromising feminist. She is, they believe, strategic.\nDetractors are highly vocal in accusing her of transphobia, of using provocative language. They question her claims about transitioning, and detransitioning. She has been labelled a Terf (trans-exclusionary radical feminist).\nShe denies she is transphobic, having said she respects \"every trans person's right to live any way that feels authentic and comfortable to them\".\nRowling's first public foray into this space came in December 2019 when she tweeted support for Maya Forstater, a tax specialist who lost her job at a thinktank after tweeting that transgender women could not change their biological sex.\nThen, in June 2020, Rowling posted a link to an article headlined \"Creating a more equal post-Covid-19 world for people who menstruate\", to which she commented: \"'People who menstruate.' I'm sure there used to be a word for those people. Someone help me out. Wumben? Wimpund? Woomud?\"\nShe said: \"If sex isn't real, the lived reality of women globally is erased. I know and love trans people but erasing the concept of sex removes the ability of so many to meaningfully discuss their lives.\"\nThe furore that followed led her to post an essay on her website outlining her concerns over \"the new trans activism\". She described herself as a \"domestic abuse and sexual assault survivor\" who had been \"triggered\" by learning the Scottish government was \"proceeding with its controversial gender recognition plans\".\nShe had spoken up about the importance of sex, she added, \"and have been paying the price ever since. I was transphobic, I was a cunt, a bitch, a Terf, I deserved cancelling, punching and death.\"\nThe backlash included actors in the Potter movies franchise Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, and Rupert Grint, making public their support for transgender rights. Radcliffe responded by saying \"transgender women are women\".\nWatson tweeted: \"Trans people are who they say they are and deserve to live their lives without being constantly questioned or told they aren't who they say they are.\"\nSign up to First Edition\nOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what's happening and why it matters\nafter newsletter promotion\nEddie Redmayne, the star of Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, based on Rowling's book, said: \"I disagree with Jo [Rowling]'s comments. Trans women are women, trans men are men and non-binary identities are valid.\"\nThere were reports of book-burnings. Rowling returned her Ripple of Hope award given to her by the Robert F Kennedy Human Rights organisation after its president, Kerry Kennedy, criticised her views on transgender issues.\nQuidditch, a sport created for the fictional world of Harry Potter, announced in 2022 it was changing its name to Quadball, with one of several reasons being that Rowling had \"increasingly come under scrutiny for her anti-trans positions\", the International Quidditch Association said.\nRowling is a serious philanthropist. She supports a wide range of humanitarian causes through her charitable trust Volant, including charities working with women and children, and donated PS10m to set up a world-leading research and treatment centre for multiple sclerosis in Scotland founded in the name of her mother, Anne Rowling, who died from the disease. In 2022, she funded and co-founded Beira's Place, a sexual violence support service for women in Edinburgh.\nShe is immensely wealthy. The Harry Potter franchise is global. HBO is producing a Harry Potter TV series, of which Rowling is executive producer. Her Robert Galbraith crime novels in the Cormoran Strike series have been adapted by the BBC.\nIf she has had concerns of any commercial impact, she has not expressed them. She bats off any suggestions from fans that she has ruined her legacy, telling one podcast they \"could not have misunderstood me more profoundly\". Rowling said: \"I do not walk around my house thinking about my legacy. What a pompous way to live your life, walking around thinking: 'What will my legacy be?' Whatever, I'll be dead. I care about now. I care about the living.\"\n This article was amended on 19 April 2025. The sexual violence support service that J K Rowling co-founded is called Beira's Place, not \"Beria's Place\" as an earlier version said.",
      "ml_hf_summary": "J.K. Rowling celebrated the UK Supreme Court ruling on the legal definition of a woman with a cigar onboard her yacht in the Bahamas.  She has been vocal and financially supportive of women-only spaces and gender-critical campaigners, including donating £70,000 to For Women Scotland's legal challenge that resulted in Wednesday's ruling. Rowling's support for these causes has drawn both praise from supporters who admire her \"doggedness\" and criticism from detractors who accuse her of transphobia.  She denies being transphobic but has been labeled a \"Terf\" (trans-exclusionary radical feminist) by critics.  Rowling's public stance on gender identity has sparked controversy, leading to backlash from actors in the Harry Potter franchise who publicly supported transgender rights. \n"

      "content": "The actor on her love of sad songs, history podcasts and cemeteries with mysterious gravestones\nBorn in Hong Kong in 1982, actor Romola Garai grew up in Singapore and Wiltshire. She has starred in films including Atonement and Suffragette, and TV series The Hour and The Miniaturist. Her directorial debut, the horror film Amulet, was released in 2020. Last year Garai portrayed Annie Ernaux in Eline Arbo's adaptation of The Years at the Almeida theatre, later transferring to the Harold Pinter theatre, for which she won best actress in a supporting role at the 2025 Olivier awards. Now she stars alongside Ivanno Jeremiah and Jamelia in new BBC Three comedy drama, Just Act Normal, available on iPlayer.\nShe's Always Hungry by Eliza Clark\nI'm not usually a fan of the short story - I often find them not very fulfilling. But I really like Eliza Clark as a writer, so I was excited to read these. The stories are great and very funny: there's such weird and dark humour in them. There's one story particularly, called The King, which is about an alien living in the body of an ad executive. And at the end of the world they form a new civilisation. It's a really witty pastiche on gender relations, and quite horrific, but extremely enjoyable.\nVollmond, Sadler's Wells\nI saw this about a month ago. I'm a huge fan of Pina Bausch and I always try to go when her company, Tanztheater Wuppertal, is performing. I'd not seen this piece before, and the dancing in it was unbelievably daring. There's a whole section at the end where the stage is full of water and the dancers have to run backwards and forwards through it. Quite a few of the dancers fell over - it's amazing to see people who are so committed to what they're doing that they're putting themselves in physical danger to achieve it.\nSay It Like You Mean It by Sleater-Kinney\nThis song does something weird to me. I quite often play it when I'm running, and then I start running really fast, like I'm chasing a mugger. It makes me feel intensely euphoric. It's a really sad song - Carrie Brownstein lost her mum in a car accident in 2022, so it's about grief and saying goodbye - but very beautiful. I've loved Sleater-Kinney for many years. All the music I like is sad - I don't like any upbeat music. But this song is incredibly purifying in its expression of grief.\nYellowjackets\nThe glut of television makes it hard to find things I really want to watch, but this show has struck me profoundly. It's about a group of women who go through an unbelievably extreme experience early on together, and it looks at the way they recover from trauma. They try to rationalise it, react against it, commodify the experience. It's truthful and brilliant. There's a scene in which one of the younger actresses, Sophie Nelisse, gives birth in the wilderness - it's a feat of acting. I don't understand why they haven't all won the top acting awards.\nThe Rest Is History - The French RevolutionI'm a big history geek so I love this podcast. It's like you're sitting around a campfire. They're very good at bringing history to life in a vivid way. The one they recently did about the French Revolution was just incredible, particularly the ones on Marie Antoinette and what happened to her. They talk about revolution, and what happens to ideas when they're co-opted by the worst kinds of people, and excesses of ideology. When an ideology takes over, it's never really about the idea - the idea is to end up in charge.\nAbney Park Cemetery, Stoke Newington, London\nAbney Park Cemetery is a mysterious and beautiful place that's been allowed to go somewhat wild. We have lots of lovely parks in London, but not that many wild places. You can walk around and hear woodpeckers and it feels very much like it's part of nature. Because it's full of trees, you see the passing of the seasons amazingly. And you can read the headstones - your brain is constantly whirring, thinking about all the titbits you get. There's one that I love where it says: \"Died in an accident.\" And always, I'm like: \"What accident?\"\nLe Cottage Bise, France\nWe stayed in this hotel on the shores of Lake Annecy in a town called Talloires. It's been there since the turn of the last century. In the morning, when you have breakfast, you sit on a terrace which looks up at the Alps. Then you can walk 50 feet and just get into the lake and swim. The lake is like Evian water - it's the most unbelievably beautiful water to swim in. They have kayaks and pedalos. It's one of the nicest places I've ever been.",

He is fascinated and appalled by the water, so solid in its power but always shifting, dissolving, sheering away.\nIf JMW Turner, born 250 years ago this spring, is Britain's greatest artist - and he is - it is partly because he is so intensely aware of a defining fact about his country: it's an island. For Turner, Britain is bordered by death, terror and adventure. Just one step from shore takes you into a world of peril. In the Iveagh Seapiece, fishers are hauling up their boats on a soaking beach while a wave like a wall surges towards them. One fishing boat is still out on the wild waters, so near to shore yet so far from safety.\nIsland artist though he is, Turner's imagination is the opposite of insular. It takes in lost civilisations and ancient myths, mountains he crossed and seas he never did. The wars that started with the French Revolution in 1789 had imprisoned Britain behind the Royal Navy's \"wooden walls\". When a short-lived peace broke out, the young landscape artist took his chance to travel, seeing a wine festival in Macon, gazing in awe at Mont Blanc - to judge from paintings he showed the next year. Before he ever saw the continent, he painted legendary Italy. All his life, he would keep up Europhile painterly pilgrimages to Venice and Rome, Heidelberg and the Saint Gotthard Pass.\nTurner was born near Covent Garden, London, on 23 April 1775, in a Britain that seemed a much bigger place than it does now. Every distance was vaster, every road felt longer. It took several days to get from London to Chester, Newcastle or Exeter. There was terra incognita at the end of your lane. When the young Turner set out on sketching tours - to Wales in 1792, the north of England in 1797 - these were journeys in a mysterious land.\nTouring Britain and Europe, returning with full sketchbooks, painting in his London studio - this was Turner's life. He showed such talent for art he was accepted into the Royal Academy Schools at 14. He never knew failure and once his career got going in the 1790s, never needed to fear poverty. He was an artistic mountain, a formidable mass of productivity, who left reams of drawings and watercolours and prints as well as oil paintings, much of it bequeathed to the nation when he died in 1851. But, outside his work, you can't really make much of Turner as a character. He slept with women but never married, built a house near the Thames, kept working, made a last home in Chelsea with his lover Sophia Booth, died there in view of the Thames. His soul is in his art.\nIt is also our soul. Turner shows us our land as a place of wonder and possibility. And he's not entirely making it up. In the golden yellow watercolour of Durham, painted around 1835, he has turned the cathedral with its twin Norman towers through 45 degrees to fit the view better and bestowed upon it the same honeyed sunlit radiance he might to a scene in Italy. But he also records the truth. On the bridge in the foreground are small figures that might be tired travellers looking for food, work, shelter who see the dazzling cathedral above them. That's his message. We may think we live in a crushed, unjust place and time but look up and see the light and you can be uplifted by sudden beauty, irradiated by hope.\nHis vision of a world torn between tragedy and possibility stretches from everyday observation to bloody myth. In his 1811 painting Apollo and Python, the Greek god of light and reason has just killed a scaly monster embodying the irrational. But it's an empty victory, for we glimpse other serpentine horrors still lurking in the tangled woody landscape. In his greatest single image of myth, Ulysses Deriding Polyphemus: Homer's Odyssey, an incandescent, smoky seascape off the coast of Sicily is the setting as the one-eyed giant cyclops rages atop Etna and the Greek hero and his crew laughingly escape the blinded monster. But the flaming sky is a false promise of freedom. Polyphemus calls on his father, Neptune, for vengeance: the sea god will wipe out Ulysses' men and delay his homecoming.\nHow did Turner become so familiar with the classics? It's tempting to see him as a working-class hero but he did not stand outside elite culture. He grew up at a time when the commercial competition and artistic daring of Hogarth, Gainsborough, Stubbs and Wright had made British art come alive. As a pupil at the Royal Academy schools, he was expected to draw from plaster casts of classical art as well as absorb the erudite references of contemporary artists such as Richard Wilson and Joshua Reynolds. Art was Turner's education in an age of educated art.\nHis age was also the Romantic age, when nature was embraced like a religion. Turner started showing at the Royal Academy's annual shows in the 1790s, when poets were experimenting with folk forms and hymning nature's joys. Wordsworth and Coleridge published Lyrical Ballads in 1798 which included The Rime of the Ancient Mariner and Lines Written a Few Miles above Tintern Abbey. Turner's early art consciously aligns itself with the Romantic generation. In the same year that the Lakeside Poets broke through, he cunningly showed his view Morning Amongst the Coniston Fells.\nAs a conscious Romantic he subscribed to theories of the picturesque and sublime and reckoned what he was doing was a kind of poetry. Landscape art had developed in the 17th century but was given new meaning in the Romantic age as nature became the bearer of intense ideals, when there was an equation of inner and outer states. Even music depicted landscape in Beethoven's Pastoral Symphony.\nTurner didn't identify with the humble voice of a Wordsworth. His hero was Lord Byron, the most aristocratic, \"immoral\", cynically observant, internationalist and political of Romantics. He even wrote his own Byronic poem, The Fallacies of Hope. He would travel to Venice and other Italian cities in emulation of Byron's Childe Harold, aiming for the same blend of travel reportage and polemic. His painting of the gory aftermath of the Battle of Waterloo, a morass of slaughtered bodies under the light of a nocturnal flare, has an inscription quoting Byron's account of the scene: \"The earth is covered thick with other clay / Which her own clay shall cover, heaped and pent, / Rider and horse - friend, foe - in one red burial blent!\" His identification with the poet shows the kind of artist he wanted to be: political and dangerous, an adventurer with a heart.\nTurner is as much a painter of time as light. He can make you marvel at the antiquity of rocks and buildings, how they have endured. History as survival fills his paintings of Caernarfon Castle or the Roman Forum. Yet he can show you sudden destruction that in an instant wipes away unchanging centuries.\nWhen the Houses of Parliament caught fire in 1834 he was on hand to paint the mass of red flame reflected in the Thames and the watching crowds, the centuries going up in smoke as the medieval heart of English government was destroyed. But do his paintings of this event mourn a disaster or rejoice in a new beginning? Two years previously the Great Reform Act had swept away much old rotten constitutional detritus. Turner may love the past but he thrills to change - even to the flames consuming the old order.\nThis ambivalent eye for history is why Turner's 250th birthday means so much. His dates have unusual significance. Born into a preindustrial world, he would live until 1851, the year of the Great Exhibition that celebrated Britain's Victorian industrial might. The French Revolution and the wars it unleashed overshadow his early art. But he also witnessed the Industrial Revolution and revelled in its new energies. Industry is never just a blight for Turner, more a release of natural forces (which, scientifically, is what it was). Steam rules the waves in Staffa, Fingal's Cave, which delights in the paradox that sightseers are taken to see an ancient natural wonder by a modern technological marvel, puffing its way through the waves.\nThe passing away of the old and the careless brightness of the future collide in his 1839 canvas The Fighting Temeraire. The world of Turner's youth is gone: one of its last relics, a ship of the line that fought at Trafalgar, is being towed to its last resting place on a Thames with shimmering bronzed waters to rival any of his mythic seas.\nThe Thames was the first stretch of water Turner saw. Its tidal reaches were surely where he first intuited the mystery of water, its instability. On it nothing is solid and there is no protector. Turner is supposed to have said in his dying hours, \"The Sun is God!\" If so, the sea is the devil. Ever since it was unveiled in 1840, Slavers Throwing Overboard the Dead and Dying (Typhoon Coming On) has been recognised as his supreme masterpiece. The wealthy father of Turner's critical champion, John Ruskin, bought it for his son. Ruskin revered the painting but could not live with it, and not just because of the human content. This is Turner's most harrowing sky, stained with bloody crimsons and purples, a vomitous natural wonder, its lurid light infecting the gas-green waves where monster fish swarm. Then there is that human content: legs and arms in the water, weighted by iron manacles and chains. It is not the sky and sea that are sick after all but the type of human society represented by the ship. Nature is not divine or cursed. But what of us?\nBritain had abolished the slave trade in 1807 and most Victorians were content to congratulate themselves on this. Why rake up the past? It took the imagination of Turner to return to the true story of the Zong, a slave ship out of Liverpool whose crew murdered more than 130 enslaved Africans in 1781, and make this horror as immediate, undying - and British - as the Fighting Temeraire.\nWhat is Turner's legacy? You could call him the Rembrandt of the sea, or the Leonardo of landscape - he has the universality and complexity of these artists. He loved to compete with the old masters, painting versions of Dutch sea-pieces and Claude's Italian scenes.\nThe occasional sniffy critic claims Constable is more honest and real, or sees Turner's prodigious output as bombastic and eccentric. But Turner knows what he is doing. He wants painting to simultaneously touch the soul, arouse the senses and challenge the mind with the most serious meditations on history, politics, even time and space. When the Hubble space telescope and now the James Webb telescope started sending back data, this was translated by Nasa into smoky, sublime images of deep space by which we now navigate our cosmos. What do these Romantic nebulae most resemble? Turner's paintings, of course.\nTurner 250, a year-long festival of events, is running now at the Tate Britain, London; Turner Contemporary, Margate, and galleries around the UK.",

As video calls go, the experience is so otherworldly the three of us might be beaming in from different planets.\nMurata is the author of 12 novels, although most readers outside Japan will know her for Convenience Store Woman, her 10th, and the first to be translated into English, in 2018. A convenience store or konbini seems an unlikely setting for a global cult hit, yet this eerily unsettling novel about 36-year-old Keiko Furukura, who has worked in the Smile Mart since she graduated and has never had a romantic relationship, has sold more than 2m copies and been translated into more than 30 languages. It won Japan's prestigious Akutagawa prize in 2016, when Vogue Japan named Murata a woman of the year. The book's success helped spark the recent boom in Japanese fiction in translation, paving the way for predominantly female writers including Mieko Kawakami (Breasts and Eggs), Asako Yuzuki (author of last year's bestseller, Butter) and Hiromi Kawakami (Under the Eye of the Big Bird, shortlisted for this year's International Booker prize). \"I never imagined that so many people would read it in Japan, let alone in other countries,\" Murata says now. \"It explores some quite unique aspects of Japanese culture.\"\nReading Murata's novels is not unlike finding yourself in a 24-hour store in an unknown city: everything is both familiar and exotic, orderly yet disquietingly unnatural and out of time. All the absurdities and cruelties of a sexist, consumerist society are revealed to be as artificial as candy under fluorescent lighting. Then there is the disorienting queasiness of her moral lens, like a security camera in the corner, recording everything without judgment. \"What a lot of hassle,\" Keiko reflects, watching her sister try to soothe her baby, before glancing at a cake knife. \"If it was just a matter of keeping him quiet, it would be easy enough.\"\nYet readers all over the world have identified with her endearingly offbeat heroine, who has been interpreted as being neurodivergent or autistic, although that wasn't the author's intention. \"It feels like a lot of people see her as a friend,\" Murata says. \"She manages to express a part of themselves.\"\nShe describes Convenience Store Woman as her \"least triggering\" novel. \"There are no scenes of cruelty, there's no sex, Keiko doesn't kill anyone.\" The rest of Murata's work is darker and weirder, continually questioning social norms. Why is it more barbaric to eat a dead body than to burn it? Is the family the only way to bring up children? Wouldn't marriage be simpler without love? \"What about the real world? Where the hell is that anyway?\" a character asks in the title story of her most recent collection, Life Ceremony.\nVanishing World was published in Japanese in 2015, before Convenience Store Woman, and is her third novel to be translated into English (all by Ginny Tapley Takemori), after Earthlings in 2020, about a girl who believes she is an alien. It poses another darkly comic thought experiment - what's the point of sex when you could just have IVF? In Murata's pristine speculative future, love is disappearing and \"primitive copulation\" is considered dirty. \"The very idea of a married couple having sex, it's horrifying!\" one character exclaims. \"The human race has advanced,\" we are told. Men can give birth from synthetic wombs and children are raised collectively. Everyone is a \"mother\".\nMurata herself considers marriage to be \"a kind of hostage situation\" and motherhood \"a curse\" that would put an end to her life as a writer. Much of her writing involves imaginative attempts to resolve the biological fatalism of being female with humanity's need to procreate. Her outlandish near-future fictional worlds are all rooted in the reality of Japan's declining birth and marriage rates, an increase in young people choosing celibacy, not to mention deeply entrenched misogyny.\nFor many, Murata has become a left-field feminist icon. \"Feminism is desperately needed in Japanese society today,\" she says, describing \"a hell soup\" in which fathers have been given lenient sentences for raping their daughters and feminists receive death threats. \"Some say that the worlds I write about are dystopian, but a lot of people think that actually reality is worse.\"\nVanishing World grew out of a short story, A Clean Marriage, published in English in Granta magazine in 2014, about a couple who choose a \"Clean Breeder\" contraption in order to conceive because they prefer not to have sex - although they do with other people. Many readers responded saying it portrayed their ideal relationship.\nIn Japan, thanks largely to the popularity of manga and anime, what Murata calls \"ficto-sexual\" attachments or relationships are not so unusual, she says. For a long time she couldn't imagine having sex with another human being. \"I've often felt love, obsession, desire, friendship, a kind of faith, or almost a prayer-like relationship with these men - and they've always been men, so it's a heterosexual relationship - who live inside stories,\" she explains. A lot of her friends have experienced similar feelings, she says. \"With Vanishing World I was trying to create a place where it might be easier for people who find it difficult to live in this world.\"\nMurata has always found it difficult to live in this world. As a child, all she wanted was to be normal. \"I wanted to blend in. I wanted not to be a foreign object,\" she says. \"Now, I think that is frightening.\" Since she started writing 20 years ago, all her work has been an attempt to answer the question: \"what is normal and what is abnormal?\" she says. \"But the more I've experimented with it, the more unstable the boundary has become. I started to think that normality itself is a kind of insanity.\"\nMurata grew up in a small city in Chiba, a prefecture east of Tokyo, in the 1980s. Her parents had an arranged marriage and very traditional values. Her father was a judge, her mother, now 79, a housewife. It was not a happy childhood. \"It looked good from the outside,\" she says, \"but now I think that I was starved of love, and that my brain was numbed and anaesthetised. But I was able to play the role of a normal girl. To this day, I think that my ability to get angry broke as a way of protecting myself.\" Unsurprisingly, mothers don't come out well in her fiction. In Vanishing World, Amane feels \"the sticky fingerprints\" of her mother's soul all over the house and \"an intense urge\" to throw up after eating her cooking.\nFrom a very young age, Murata never thought of her body as her own. \"The grownups would always talk about whether Sayaka had childbearing hips,\" she recalls. \"It was almost like they were keeping an eye on my uterus, which was something that existed not for me, but for them, for the relatives.\" No matter how much she tried to resolve the conflict of motherhood in her fiction, she has never escaped \"this idea of being expected to reproduce for the good of the village\".\nShe found erotic magazines hidden in her older brother's bedroom. \"It was all over the place,\" she says of the culture at that time; even the manga comics aimed at young girls involved the characters being forced to take their clothes off. \"So I didn't think of sexual love as something that I could choose for myself,\" she says. \"I always thought of my body as a tool for men to relieve their sexual desires.\" Looking back, she endured \"a lot of unpleasant sexual experiences\", including rape, some of which she was unable to recognise for what they were. \"I hadn't realised that I was abused, that I was a victim, or that I was crushed by the way that my mum spoke to me,\" she says. \"I've survived, I think, by forgetting.\" She also survived by writing stories. From the age of 10, writing became the one place where she could express all these feelings.\nAs a student at Tokyo's Tamagawa University, studying for a degree in art curation (combining art, music, literature and theatre), she started work at a convenience store. She then worked in a succession of similar konbinis, like Keiko, for another 18 years. There she was able to forget her gender for the first time. Unlike her only other job as a waitress, where she was told to wear makeup and behave in a certain way, in the convenience store men and women wore the same uniform and did the same job. \"No one said anything if you showed up one day with no makeup,\" she says. \"It was almost like I wasn't a woman, I was just a convenience store worker. I was just a kindly vending machine.\"\nShe would wake at 2am and write until 6am before starting her shift, then she would go to a cafe when it finished at lunchtime and write all afternoon. To begin with, it never occurred to her to write about the store itself. But then she realised that this too was a vanishing world, with self-service tills replacing workers. \"Suddenly I thought: I need to write about this now, the role that it plays in society, the functions it fulfils. I need to capture this moment.\"\nMurata only gave up working in the store in 2017, but her routine hasn't changed much since. She still lives in the Shinjuku district of Tokyo, where she moved as a student. To escape the storytelling in her head and her \"incredibly messy\" apartment, she prefers to work in cafes. She needs to hear the sound of people around her, and often moves from one cafe to another. Sometimes, she goes for a walk in the nearby Shinjuku Gyoen National Garden, before taking the tube home. \"It's a very boring routine.\"\nMurata still occasionally finds it a struggle to be what she calls an \"ordinary earthling\". She suffers from bouts of dysautonomia and vertigo. After becoming fixated on killing an established male editor she calls Z-san, who she felt was a bully who abused his power, she ended up in hospital. She wrote about the ordeal, in an untranslated essay published in Shincho magazine in 2022, titled The Commonplace Urge to Kill.\nShe certainly doesn't think of herself as an internationally famous novelist. She was once taught to think of writing as sheet music, with readers playing the notes. \"But the music isn't mine,\" she says. \"I'm happy if there are a lot of people performing this music and that gives me the motivation to keep writing.\"\nIs she happy more generally? \"Hai!\" she replies so emphatically it doesn't need translating. \"Yes, I am very happy. I am surrounded by things I love and I am now able to talk about things that I had kept hidden. I can say I am blessed.\" Then she says thank you and goodbye in English, and that it would be lovely to meet in the real world one day. Where the hell is that anyway?\n Vanishing World is published by Granta on 24 April (PS16.99). To support the Guardian and Observer, order your copy at guardianbookshop.com.

      "content": "After two decades of video sensations, here's a reminder of the streaming platform's most unforgettable clips - year by year\nFrom weird elephant videos to revolutionising TV: 20 years of YouTube\nYouTube is 20 years old. Although video had existed online before, YouTube's ease of use - for the first time sites could easily embed video into their content - made it revolutionary. As such, we now live in a world where people watch more YouTube than anything else. But how did we get here? Perhaps the best way to find out is to trace the most significant videos produced in each of its 20 years.\nThe video that started it all. A 19-second clip of YouTube co-founder Jawed Karim in San Diego Zoo, trying to explain an elephant - awkwardly. As one modern comment left under the video now states, it's refreshing that Me at the Zoo didn't end with Jawed urging viewers to smash the like button.\nA man (credited as \"inspirational comedian Judson Laipply\") performs dances in rough chronological order to the screaming delight of an unseen crowd. Perhaps it was the lack of options available to users but, at the time, this was a blockbuster.\nMaybe the definitive YouTube video. A baby bites his brother's finger, and the brother cycles through every available emotion as he attempts to process the sensation. In a true and just world, Charlie Bit My Finger would be shown before the news every evening to cheer people up. A joy.\nIn time, YouTube's most viewed lists would be dominated by music videos, but this was the first big one. The appeal of Crank That was that, like The Macarena and The Birdie Song before it, it had an accompanying dance. The video is full of people doing that dance.\nPeople couldn't get enough ofthe Britain's Got Talent judges and audience's reaction to Susan Boyle - a baffled \"How can someone who looks like that sing like this?\" Today, it feels even more gruesome than it did at the time.\nFor a brief time, a fun thing to do on the internet was to autotune people to make songs of what they were saying. Nick Clegg was one notable victim of this [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUDjRZ30SNo], but he was dwarfed in terms of popularity by Antoine Dodson went viral when his local Alabama news appearance was remixed into an absurdly catchy song via Auto-Tune. He was talking about someone's attempt to sexually assault his sister. Different times.\nI'm going to call it: this was when the internet peaked. Rebecca Black was a girl overcome with ambitions of pop stardom. Her mother paid $4,000 to a company called ARK Music Factory to write and produce a song and music video for her. The result was Friday. The lyrics (\"Yesterday was Thursday / Today is Friday ... Tomorrow is Saturday / And Sunday comes afterwards\") were inane. The performance was iffy. But there was an innocence to Friday that felt extremely pure. Even betterSomehow, Black has managed to leverage the song'sits notoriety into an actual music career.\nA monster, pure and simple. The first video ever to gain a billion views on YouTube, thanks to its catchy tune and knowingly absurd visuals. Both wonderful (it represents Year Zero of contemporary K-pop) and dreadful (Ed Balls did the dance on Strictly), this song changed the world.\nThis song didn't change the world, but well done for trying. The follow-up to Gangnam Style. The video wasn't quite as memorable, the song wasn't quite as catchy, and there was generally a sense that straws were being clutched at. Still, more people watched this than anything else in 2013, so that's something.\nPsy couldn't hold on to his crown for a third year, because he was comprehensively outviewed by this oddity. It's a short horror film whose antagonist is a dog dressed up as a spider. It is genuinely quite creepy in places, genuinely very stupid in others and has been watched more than 184m times.\nBy its 10th anniversary, YouTube had already ossified into what it is now: largely a collection of music videos and televisionTV clips, with its former quirky individualism shoved to the side. According to Google [https://blog.google/products/youtube/youtube-rewind-2015/], the top trending videos of the year included three late night talkshow clips, a handful of music videos and a Super Bowl advert for a mobile game. But then there was also this, a video of a man who turned his lounge into a ball pit.\nFor a brief time, James Corden's Late Late Show perfected the YouTube video, by getting the big stars of the day to belt out their own songs in a car. Adele's instalment was an immediate sensation, featuring all of her biggest songs at the point where she was arguably the biggest act in the world. James Corden was there too.\nI've been leaving lots of music videos off this list, but Despacito deserves its place. It is, at time of writing, the second most-watched YouTube video of all time, with 8.6bn views. The song is catchy, the video bright and colourful. Perhaps the secret to Despacito's success, though, is the fact that, its lyrics are absurdly filthy. Either way, this is the song that soundtracked a million spin classes.\nOver the last two decades, YouTube has acted as a barometer for our changing tastes. We can now look back and see, for instance, that seven years ago everyone was so obsessed with the Kardashians that hundreds of millions of people watched a syrupy compilation of Kylie Jenner's faux-grainy pregnancy home movies. To demonstrate what a weird moment in time this was, her follow-up video To Our Son - released just four years later - only got a third of the views.\nA particularly dry year for YouTube, with its most-viewed videos all being music videos or TV clips. In the UK, the most-watched video was a BT Sports compilation of a football match. The days of Mutant Giant Spider Dog were well behind us, clearly.\nI have to confess to some creative accounting here, since Baby Shark Dance wasThis was originally uploaded back in 2016. However, in November 2020 it hit a staggering milestone, becoming the most-watched YouTube video of all time. At present, Baby Shark Dance has 15.7 billion views, almost doubling those of Luis Fonsi. Is this because as a society we are fully invested in the family dynamics of cartoon sharks? Or could it be, perhaps, that the pandemic was a really difficult time to be the parent of young children, and sometimes you'd just let them sit in front of YouTube for hours on end? Who can say.\nThis might represent the birth of modern YouTube. The video's creator MrBeast is arguably the most successful YouTuber on the planet, crafting a series of grabby stunts with production values that rival traditional TV. Including this, the most watched video of 2021, MrBeast made himself comfortable in a big coffin and let his friends bury him for two days.\nIn 2022, the influential Minecraft YouTuber Technoblade, who had been publishing videos for nine years, died of metastatic sarcomacancer. Shortly afterwards, his channel posted a video where Technoblade's father read a statement from him, and tearfully described what he was like as his son. Despite all the noise that YouTube creates, the fact that the most watched video of the year was a man processing his grief is a testament to how beloved Technoblade was.\nWhen it is eventually released, Grand Theft Auto VI will almost certainly become the most successful piece of media, of any form, that has ever been made. Such is the demand for it that, when its first trailer was released in December 2023, it broke the record for most views in 24 hours, not including music videos. All that and it reintroduced the world to a Tom Petty banger.\nAnd here we reach the new age of YouTube where, in a bid to rival TikTok, many of the top-hitting videos now come in the form of scrollable shorts, which do enormous numbers despite being genuinely inane. One of the most-watched YouTubeShorts, for instance, is a legitimately nightmarish instructional video about how to make a ladybird out of slime [https://www.youtube.com/shorts/Kq4O7W5EQ7Y]. However, iIn 2024, no short was viewed as much as this one, about a girl climbing over a fence. Welcome to the future.",

And which products are safe for your teenager to use, if any? We spoke to eight dermatologists to find out their own skincare routines - and which mistakes they see most often. Spoiler: none of them use snail slime.\nDr Angela Tewari, consultant dermatologist at King's College hospital, London, and founder of the Dermatology Studios\nWhat's your daily skincare routine?\n At the moment I'm using a mild glycolic wash from Tropic, which contains jojoba oil, because I'm prone to dry skin. I then use a DNA repair serum by Neova, which has a number of encapsulated enzymes that fight off residual sun damage, followed by Phyto A+ Brightening Treatment by SkinCeuticals, which enhances radiance. This is followed by Clinique's Moisture Surge Sheertint Hydrator SPF 25.\nWhat's your bargain beauty buy?Nivea body lotion Q10. It contains nourishing almond oil and I feel I'm rejuvenating my body.\nWhich beauty trend would you never recommend trying, and why?\n Snail mucin - it contains hyaluronic acid, but putting snails on your face or using their slime is not my cup of tea. There are cheaper ways of getting moisture into the skin with a more generic hyaluronic acid.\nWhat skincare do you recommend for children - and what should they stay away from?\n They should be avoiding glycolic acids, high-dose salicylic acid and retinoids - anything that would increase the turnover of their skin cells. Until our early 20s, our skin turnover is excellent, so we do not need to accelerate this at a younger age.\nWhat treatment/gadget would you blow the bank on?\n I've found the Lightinderm LED device very helpful. You insert capsules of DNA repair enzymes into it and these are activated by the wavelengths it produces. This enables repair of any sun-induced changes and pigmentation, and it lifts skin. The device costs PS400.\nWhat skincare advice would you give your younger self?\n I wish I'd known that, actually, my skin is beautiful, but it's very hard to realise that at the time - we always think we look a lot worse than we do.\nWhat's the product you can't live without?DNA Total Repair serum by Neova. It goes on the skin after washing and improves radiance while reducing fine lines and helping with pigmentation.\nWhat's the most common mistake you see?\n People going for filler when they really need a booster - polynucleotide injections are anti-inflammatory and promote collagen - and good skincare.\nWhat do you do that would surprise people?\n Sometimes if I'm very tired, after putting my three children to bed, I don't take my makeup off before going to sleep. Ideally, you should remove those layers of dirt and pollution at night, as we know they contribute to oxidative stress and skin damage.\nDr Ophelia Veraitch, consultant dermatologist at 101 Harley Street and University College London Hospitals NHS foundation trust\nWhat's your daily skincare routine?\n During my morning shower, I cleanse with Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser. Then I apply one of my Hyperpigmentation Day Serums, a prescription product to target pigmentation, which I am prone to. Next, I apply the Skinceuticals Skin Brightening SPF 30. At night-time, I use the Skinceuticals Blemish + Age Cleanser Gel and apply my Dr Ophelia Acne Night Serum, which helps prevent congestion.\nWhat's your bargain beauty buy?\n The Cetaphil cleanser is gentle and suitable for my whole family, including a daughter with mild eczema and a son who is beginning to develop mild acne. Cetraben Moisturising Lotion is suitable for everyone's face and body.\nWhich beauty trend would you never recommend trying, and why?\n Collagen supplements - there are no high-quality scientific or clinical studies to suggest that ingesting collagen helps restore the lost collagen in our skin. Similarly, biotin supplements (taken to thicken hair) interfere with a large number of blood tests, including those used for diagnosing heart attacks and thyroid function. There is an FDA warning against biotin supplementation, and I have seen a number of patients with excessive hair shedding caused by taking these supplements.\nWhat skincare do you recommend for children - and what should they stay away from?\n My daughter recently turned 10, and I had offers from other parents to buy her skincare vouchers, which I politely declined on her behalf. I don't want her getting obsessed with these trends that could damage her skin. She and my 12-year-old son both use Cetaphil in the shower, and Cetraben as a moisturiser. On occasion, I have given them stronger products to help get rid of patches of dry skin or breakouts of spots.\nWhat treatment/gadget would you blow the bank on?\n Once a year I have Thermage FLX - a radio frequency device that is very good for tightening and lifting the skin. It costs about PS2,000 for a full face treatment and gives very natural, but definite, results. It's good for those who aren't open to surgical options; I'm finding that patients are wanting to go for cosmetic surgery less and less.\nWhat skincare advice would you give your younger self?\n Not to waste money on luxury brands. I suffered from awful acne and pigmentation when I was younger, despite always buying into the most expensive ranges. As a result, I am highly sensitive to many ingredients, which has taught me simple skincare with effective treatments is the best approach.\nWhat's the product you can't live without?\n A daily SPF.\nWhat's the most common mistake you see?\n Only wearing an SPF in the summer rather than all year round; following skin influencers on social media instead of seeking proper professional help; rotating through many different skincare products.\nWhat do you do that would surprise people?\n I often go through long periods of just cleansing, then using an SPF. If serums for hyperpigmentation or acne work, you shouldn't need to keep using them for ever!\nDr Tanja Phillips, laser and aesthetic medicine specialist at the HVN, alongside her own clinic\nWhat's your daily skincare routine?\n ZO Skin Health is my go-to. I use its exfoliating cleanser in the morning, which has tiny biodegradable beads to remove dead skin cells, followed by one of ZO's Complexion Renewal Pads. Next, I apply its Firming Serum, which has a lot of growth factors and peptides to stimulate new growth and improve skin barrier function. After that, I apply Daily Power Defense, which also helps to improve cell turnover, followed by Heliocare 360deg Pigment Solution Fluid, which protects against UVA, UVB and HEV (blue light from devices). I've just started using AWvi products, which work with your gut and skin microbiome. I use their cleanser, serum and face cream in the evening, which comes with an oral dose of probiotics - you sprinkle them on your tongue to help regenerate skin from the inside out.\nWhat's your bargain beauty buy?CeraVe face washes are great - they're unscented and uncomplicated, and have good clinical trials behind them. They're very effective for anyone with combination skin or acne.\nWhich beauty trend would you never recommend trying, and why?Lemon Bottle fat-dissolving injections. They've been huge on TikTok, and my clinics get a lot of calls requesting them, but for me, the answer has to be no - there aren't any good clinical trials to suggest they are effective. Instead, I'd recommend injecting a product called Pluryal, which is very effective at breaking down the membrane of fat cells, helping to get rid of stubborn pockets such as back fat or love handles.\nWhat skincare do you recommend for children - and what should they stay away from?\n I love that children are interested in skin health, and I wouldn't pooh-pooh their interest, but it doesn't mean that they have to be obsessed. They just need a good, gentle facial wash (CeraVe is great), there's no need for acids or exfoliants. Most young people don't need any additional hydration, but I would recommend an SPF every single day from as young as possible. From about 20 they can start considering whether they might need a moisturiser, but most 20-year-olds won't.\nWhat treatment/gadget would you blow the bank on?\n I'm a big laser fan. Fotona is a collagen-stimulating laser, which is a natural way of improving cell turnover, and one of the few treatments that work on rosacea. For younger people, it can be great for treating excessive oiliness and acne. It's versatile, safe, and delivers results with no need for downtime because it penetrates the glands without damaging the surface. It costs from about PS550 for a treatment.\nWhat skincare advice would you give your younger self?\n I was a sun-worshipper - I wish I'd known to use SPF come rain or shine. I tell patients of every age that SPF will save them spending a fortune seeing people like me for pigmentation reduction, loss of collagen, and wrinkles. You can still tan while wearing SPF, just stay in the shade during the hottest part of the day.\nWhat's the product you can't live without?\n Other than my SPF, a good cleanser (such as the ZO Exfoliating Cleanser) to get rid of pollutants.\nWhat's the most common mistake you see?\n It amazes me how many people don't wash their face properly. I wouldn't recommend using just cleanser and your fingers - you'd be surprised how much more comes off if you use a mitt or muslin cloth. I always recommend a double cleanse in the evening to prevent free radicals from damaging your skin overnight. Also, applying SPF from the middle of the face out and forgetting the edges. I see a lot of pigmentation towards the hairline where SPF hasn't reached.\nWhat do you do that would surprise people?\n Even if I'm inside without any windows, if I am using a computer screen, I will wear an SPF to protect from HEV rays (blue light), which contribute to overall skin damage. When choosing an SPF it should protect against UVA, UVB and HEV rays.\nDr Aamna Adel, consultant dermatologist and skin and hair loss specialist\nWhat's your daily skincare routine?\n I've got quite dry skin so I don't use a cleanser first thing - for people with dry, sensitive skin, splashing your face with water in the morning is fine. I use the Garnier Micellar Cleansing Water, which hydrates my skin, followed by SkinCeuticals' Dual Antioxidant Treatment with vitamin C. At the moment I'm using the Beauty Pie Triple Hyaluronic Acid cream to moisturise, and a sunscreen. I love La Roche-Posay Anthelios UVMune 400 because it's tinted. In the evening, I double cleanse using CeraVe Hydrating Facial Cleanser. I use a prescription tretinoin, then a Haruharu Wonder Black Rice Bakuchiol Eye Cream, which is anti-ageing without being irritating.\nWhat's your bargain beauty buy?\n Nivea is a great budget sunscreen - it's much cheaper than anything else on the market without any of the greasiness or chalkiness of cheaper brands.\nWhich beauty trend would you never recommend trying, and why?\n People using beef tallow as an alternative to moisturiser. A lot of \"natural\" trends tend to do more harm than good. There's no evidence that animal fat is particularly hydrating, and it's more likely to cause irritation than a standard moisturiser. Homemade sunscreen is another absolute no - never do that!\nWhat skincare do you recommend for children - and what should they stay away from?\n My daughter is two-and-a-half and she's already interested in skincare - I think a lot of children watch their mums do a skincare routine and want to copy them. Children only need to use a cleanser and an SPF and moisturiser combo, for simplicity. In my clinic, I see a lot of young people who have damaged skin barriers from using products that aren't designed for them. Early exposure to certain active ingredients, such as retinol and vitamin C, can lead to allergies in the long term.\nWhat treatment/gadget would you blow the bank on?\n There's lots of data to suggest that LED masks help to stimulate collagen. CurrentBody has a good one. It costs PS399.99.\nWhat skincare advice would you give your younger self?\n I wish I'd known to take my makeup off before bed when I was at university. It dries out the skin and leads to irritation.\nWhat's the product you can't live without?Eucerin UreaRepair Original is my ride-or-die face cream. It's great if you have dry skin, or just want to keep a baseline of hydration.\nWhat's the most common mistake you see?\n Doing too much. Overcomplicated skincare routines lead to skin not being as healthy as it should be. There's also a misconception that skincare alone can fix everything - when it comes to things like acne or rosacea, it's better to seek professional advice early on. It's much easier to treat acne with antibiotics or prescription retinoids than to treat acne scarring.\nWhat do you do that would surprise people?\n I don't use retinol every day - the goal shouldn't be to get to everyday use, it should be to get to a frequency that works for you. On average, I use it three times a week.\nDr Joney De Souza, aesthetic doctor and member of the British College of Aesthetic Medicine\nSign up to Inside Saturday\nThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine. Sign up to get the inside story from our top writers as well as all the must-read articles and columns, delivered to your inbox every weekend.\nafter newsletter promotion\nWhat's your daily skincare routine?\n I always advise people to keep it simple: a good cleanser, antioxidant and retinol. The cleanser should have salicylic acid - it works like a detergent to scoop out all the oil and dirt inside the pores, which can become blackheads (the ZO Exfoliating Cleanser has a high concentration). Then I apply an antioxidant vitamin C serum - SkinCeuticals has a very good range. I wear SPF 30 during the daytime because I have very oily skin, so I can end up breaking out. At night I use a Retinol Skin Brightener from ZO.\nWhat's your bargain beauty buy?Eucerin moisturisers are nicely priced and not too oily - they work really well.\nWhich beauty trend would you never recommend trying, and why?\n The \"glass skin\" trend encourages people to use whitening products designed for those experiencing melasma, which is pigmentation that appears during pregnancy. They contain hydroquinone, a bleaching agent used by people in a lot of Indian and African countries, that can lead to serious complications.\nWhat skincare do you recommend for children - and what should they stay away from?\n Children have thinner skin barriers, so it's important to use sensitive products. I would recommend La Roche-Posay moisturiser and a spray SPF because it's easier to apply if they hate being rubbed. For a teenager with oily skin and breakouts, I'd suggest a cleanser with salicylic acid, something like Clean & Clear. For young people with eczema, products with lactic acid are very moisturising.\nWhat treatment/gadget would you blow the bank on?\n A red-light treatment - the results are incredible. It stimulates circulation so it promotes healing, and can be used for hair loss. We usually combine it with other treatments: CO2, chemical peels or facials. Red-light treatments are quick and easy, so can be done from about PS60 a session.\nWhat skincare advice would you give your younger self?\n Growing up in Brazil, I wish I'd known the importance of SPF - sun exposure is the cause of 80-90% of visible ageing. Some people are good at applying SPF to their face, but forget their arms. You risk not only dark pigmentation but white spots (loss of pigmentation), which you cannot get rid of.\nWhat's the product you can't live without?\n Retinol. As we age, our skin becomes lazy, which means a buildup of dead skin, which looks very dull and sallow. Retinol causes enough irritation to increase the speed of cell turnover. I would recommend retinol for everyone - sometimes people with sensitive skin think that they can't use it, but it's just a matter of using a lower dose and adapting.\nWhat's the most common mistake you see?\n People like using very oily, buttery creams - expensive ones like Creme de la Mer. They feel amazing when you apply them, but what you are doing is adding oil on top of dead skin cells, which encourages your skin to be even lazier and dull-looking. A lot of people have the impression that Dior or Chanel skincare is the best, but it doesn't contain any active ingredients because they don't want their consumers to complain that they've caused irritation. People often think that they're allergic to products that are actually doing their job.\nWhat do you do that would surprise people?\n I don't reapply my SPF during the day. I'm too lazy!\nDr Jonathan Kentley, consultant dermatologist at Montrose London and Chelsea and Westminster hospital\nWhat's your daily skincare routine?\n In the morning I wash my face with warm water in the shower, then I use the Dr Rossi Derm MD range, which contains a sea anemone peptide to prevent irritation. The range consists of an essence containing lactic acid and niacinamide, a serum with hyaluronic acid and a titanium dioxide-based mineral sunscreen. In the evening I'll cleanse with a simple CeraVe Hydrating Facial Cleanser, or a twice-weekly hydroxy acid, which acts as an exfoliant. This is followed by the all-important tretinoin and a low-potency retinoid around the eyes (I like skinbetter's EyeMax AlphaRet Overnight Cream).\nWhat's your bargain beauty buy?\n I don't believe you need to spend a huge amount on moisturisers. I'll use one of the pharmacy brands like La Roche-Posay, Avene or Eucerin as they have ranges formulated for all skin types at a good price point - but even Nivea and Simple are absolutely fine.\nWhich beauty trend would you never recommend trying, and why?\n The TikTok trend for applying beef tallow to the face has been pushed as a solution to many skin problems. Personally, I find this mad. Beef fat is really greasy and blocks pores, and I've seen a few patients come to the clinic with quite severe acne breakouts as a result. Bottom line: smearing animal fat on your face probably isn't the best idea.\nWhat skincare do you recommend for children - and what should they stay away from?\n Keep it simple: sunscreen and a moisturiser if they are prone to dry skin. The trend for tweenagers to use actives like retinoids and hydroxy acids does more harm than good - they aren't meant for immature skin.\nWhat treatment/gadget would you blow the bank on?\n I was quite sceptical of LED face masks when they appeared on the market, but there is quite a lot of evidence that they are beneficial. I also like to do an annual non-ablative fractional laser. This essentially drills microscopic holes in your face and your body's response is to create new collagen and elastin as a wound-healing response, leaving the skin with great tone and texture, and preventing fine lines.\nWhat skincare advice would you give your younger self?Definitely sunscreen. With 80-90% of visible ageing and the vast majority of skin cancers caused by UV exposure, it can never be too soon to start using it!\nWhat's the product you can't live without?Lanolips 101 Ointment. This rich hydrating cream is amazing as a lip balm as well as for dry patches on the hands, elbows or anywhere.\nWhat's the most common mistake you see?\n Overdoing it! Patients often apply about 20 different actives and turn up to clinic with a carrier bag full of serums that are actually causing significant skin irritation. It's important to stick to a few effective actives tailored to your individual skin needs.\nWhat do you do that would surprise people?\n If I'm being completely honest, I don't wear SPF on a cloudy day in winter, especially if I'm going to be at work all day. Cancer-causing UVB rays are very low in winter, and even though UVA (which is responsible for ageing) is present all year round, it seems that in the UK it is at lower levels than previously thought. The amount of UVA I encounter on my morning commute is unlikely to cause much damage.\nDr Sharon Belmo, clinical lead for skin of colour at the Centre of Evidence Based Dermatology at the University of Nottingham\nWhat's your daily skincare routine?In the morning I wash my face with Dr Naana Fresh Face Cleanser, which is packed with soothing and moisturising ingredients such as an oat-derived surfactant, aloe vera and glycerin. It has been tested on all skin types, which is a rarity. Afterwards, I apply Revision Skincare C+ Correcting Complex and Epionce Renewal Facial Lotion, which is very moisturising without clogging the pores. My favourite sunscreen is Colorescience Sunforgettable Total Protection Face Shield in bronze. In the evening, I use the same cleanser and renewal lotion.\nWhat's your bargain beauty buy?Eucerin Aquaphor - it's the best for dry lips.\nWhich beauty trend would you never recommend trying, and why?\n DIY or bargain injectables/fillers - these should only be performed by a licensed professional. Unfortunately, the market is very poorly regulated in the UK and there are many non-medical practitioners performing such procedures in beauty salons or even at home. To stay safe, choose a qualified medical professional, eg a dermatologist, cosmetic surgeon, GP, dentist or nurse, who is fully registered with the relevant professional body (for doctors, the General Medical Council; for nurses, the Nursing and Midwifery Council).\nWhat skincare do you recommend for children - and what should they stay away from?\n I did not think about skincare as a tween - I think it has gone too far. Less is more for most people, but particularly at this age. My daughter is five and I focus on hydration, with fragrance-free moisturisers such as CeraVe moisturising cream. Unless prescribed, I would not advise tweens to be using retinoids.\nWhat treatment/gadget would you blow the bank on?\n Microneedling - this is a great multifunctional treatment and can be used on all skin types. It uses tiny needles to create micro-injuries to the skin, boosting collagen, which can improve the texture and appearance of the skin. It can also be used to treat fine lines, acne scars and hyperpigmentation. It costs about PS100-PS300 a session (usually sold in packages).\nWhat skincare advice would you give your younger self?Sunscreen! The prominence of uneven skin tone and hyperpigmentation, as a result of exposure to UV light being so prominent in darker skin tones, was not discussed when I was younger.\nWhat's the product you can't live without?Epionce Renewal Facial Lotion is my go-to. It is light but packed with ceramides and hyaluronic acid, which help retain moisture levels. The cream version is richer and perfect for winter or more mature skin.\nWhat's the most common mistake you see?\n Using too many products, too many steps and over-exfoliating, all of which can lead to skin irritation. A basic routine is cleanser, antioxidant-based product, if you are using one, moisturiser, and sunscreen in the morning. Then, at night: cleanser, retinoid-based product, if you are using one, and moisturiser. There may be additional steps for specific concerns such as acne, ageing skin or hyperpigmentation but I would advise taking advice from a dermatologist, who may prescribe treatments that are multifunctional and more efficient.\nWhat do you do that would surprise people?\n I don't use a retinoid/retinol! They're great, but not for everyone. For some, they are too harsh and cause irritation. Follow your skin type, not trends.\nDr Rhys Beynon, GMC-registered aesthetic doctor with a background in surgery and emergency medicine\nWhat's your daily skincare routine?\n I like to keep things as simple as possible; the three essential products I recommend for most of my clients are sunscreen, vitamin C and retinol/tretinoin. In the shower, I cleanse using AlumierMD's SensiCalm Cleanser before applying its 15% vitamin C serum, which helps with fine lines and wrinkles, boosts collagen and brightens the skin. I use La Roche-Posay Anthelios Age Correct, an SPF, which also contains hyaluronic acid and niacinamide so I don't need to add a moisturiser. In the evening, I use a prescription-only tretinoin, which improves skin texture and helps fight fine lines and wrinkles. I prefer prescription tretinoin to retinol because it is more potent and gives better results.\nWhat's your bargain beauty buy?CeraVe Hydrating Facial Cleanser is a perfect gentle cleanser that will refresh the skin without overstripping it or leaving it feeling tight and dry. It contains ceramides that help boost your skin's natural barrier. I also love The Ordinary's Azelaic Acid suspension 10%. Azelaic acid is a natural and effective antioxidant found in grains; I often recommend this product to clients who have redness, rosacea or acne. It also helps improve skin texture, so is a great anti-ageing treatment, too.\nWhich beauty trend would you never recommend trying, and why?\n There are so many! But my main concern at the moment is about plasma pen treatments, which use an electrical current to heat the skin, causing it to contract and tighten. If done incorrectly, this can cause bad scarring and long-term skin damage.\nWhat skincare do you recommend for children - and what should they stay away from?\n I think it's amazing that young people are thinking about their skin, but I do have significant concerns about the effect of social media on young people's perceptions of themselves. I'm also concerned that the information they see is not regulated and maybe not aimed directly at teenagers - adolescents should not be using active ingredients such as vitamin C and retinol (unless prescribed by a doctor). Young skin is very delicate and should only need a gentle cleanser, light moisturiser and factor 50+ sunscreen if out in the sun. Paula's Choice has some good advice for managing teenage breakouts.\nWhat treatment/gadget would you blow the bank on?\n I'd recommend CurrentBody's Dermalux Flex MD LED Light Therapy Device, which is the most powerful light-treatment device that you can have at home, and is three times more powerful than other home devices. It has three light sources: red light, which is anti-inflammatory and boosts collagen and hydration in the skin; near-infrared light, which works at a deeper level for healing; and blue light, which is great for acne/breakouts. It's mainly used in clinics, but the company does sell them for home use. This device costs PS1,999.\nWhat skincare advice would you give your younger self?To stay out of the sunshine and to start wearing factor 50 every day - when my clients come for a skincare consultation, including a factor 50 SPF is the first step I add to their daily routine. I'm always asked what the best product is and I always say, \"It's the one that you like to wear every day.\" There are hundreds on the market so find the one that suits you.\nWhat's the product you can't live without?\n At the moment, I'm obsessed with AlumierMD MicroDerm Polish - it leaves my skin feeling so smooth, refreshed and polished.\nWhat's the most common mistake you see?\n People buying expensive skincare products that don't have any active ingredients in them. They don't work at a cellular level, they just make the skin feel nice.\nWhat do you do that would surprise people?\n I have very few steps to my skincare routine. When things get busy, all I manage to do is wash my face in the shower and put my sunscreen on - life is complicated enough as it is!",

I've tested vacuum cleaners, mops, hard-floor cleaners, carpet cleaners, window vacs and various robots designed to do jobs automatically, from internal cleaning to lawn mowing. I've got a keen nose for a labour-saving device, and I live in a busy household that never seems short of a dirty surface to test things on, including an extensive patio area and a filthy car. There was a perfect alignment of dirty jobs crying out to test these pressure washers on.\nI gathered eight pressure washers of various types and prices from a range of manufacturers, and put each through the same tests. First, I used each washer to clean one of the dirty paving slabs at the side of my house. This is where the dog gets washed after walks and it's a well-trodden thoroughfare, making it a dark and grimy corridor.\nNext, I wanted to test the washers on decking. Unfortunately, I don't have a deck of my own, so I had to find someone else's to clean. Fortunately, a shoutout on our neighbourhood WhatsApp group found a neighbour with a deck that hadn't had a deep clean for a few years, so it was primed and ready to challenge the washers. This was by far the wettest job of the lot - but my neighbour was delighted with the extreme hose down I gave it.\nI then washed the wheels of my car. As with most cars, it has only four, so I washed half of each wheel with each washer, so I could compare their work.\nWhere appropriate, I tried the various attachments and settings that I hadn't used previously on other jobs. It included cleaning out empty water butts, clearing a few years of built-up algae off my whirligig and testing the supplied foam cannon on the rest of my car.\nAll of the pressure washers were supplied by their manufacturers, most of whom will pick them up when I've finished. Any that don't get collected will be given to Workaid, a Chesham-based charity that refurbishes tools of all kinds. It donates them to training centres and self-help organisations in Africa and the UK, to help young people develop new skills or start their own businesses.\nPS149.90 at AvaPS149.90 at Amazon\nAva may not be a household name in the UK but the Norwegian pressure washer manufacturer has entered the market with affordable products that are designed to last. The P40 is a great entry-level device that should last for years, with a 10-year warranty to back it up.\nWhy we love itIt's clear that the design focused on how the product would be used. It feels better built than similarly priced rivals, from the kink-free steel-lined pressure hose to robust but easy-to-release clips that hold all the parts together.\nMy favourite feature is the extendable lance. At the push of a button, the lance can extend from 84cm to 116cm. If you're working on cleaning a floor, there's no question this will reduce the amount of bending you have to do.\nThe kit I reviewed came with two nozzles (one variable for adjusting the width and pressure of the cleaning area, and another turbo nozzle for particularly tough jobs) and a foam cannon. Matching this with Ava's detergents made car cleaning a breeze, and it performed well in all my tests.\nIt's a shame that ... it's not as powerful as the most powerful products we've tested here, so it can be bettered for stubborn dirt on the hardest surfaces.\nSuitable for: patio, decking/fences, garden tools, garden furniture, drains/guttering, vehiclesPressure hose length: 6mWeight: 4.5kgCorded or cordless: cordedCleaning power: 11,313 cleaning units (6.5 litres a minute x 1,740PSI)Attachments included: zoom lance, turbo nozzle, vario nozzle, foam cannonWarranty: 10 years\nPS72 at Argos\nKarcher sells more pressure washers than any other manufacturer, with the low price of the K 2 indicating why. None of the other washers we tested were as affordable as this compact unit.\nWhy we love itIts affordability makes it ideal if you want something quick for occasional use. Considering the low price you're still getting a surprisingly effective cleaner. It doesn't have the clever design and high build quality of corded rivals from Ava and Bosch, but there's been no skimping on raw cleaning power.\nIt's a lesser specification but still comes with two nozzles, which are pre-attached to their own lances. One produces a lighter spray at a fixed angle, while the other is a turbo nozzle that sends out a powerful rotating jet. The turbo nozzle was good at cleaning paving slabs and the lighter nozzle did good work on my car wheels.\nIt's a shame that ... you get what you pay for in build quality: the pressure hose wants to stay curled up, no matter what you do with it, and the unit is so light that it's prone to falling over.\nSuitable for: patio, decking/fences, garden tools, garden furniture, drains/guttering, vehiclesPressure hose length: 3mWeight: 3.2kgCorded or cordless: cordedCleaning power: 9,573 cleaning units (6 litres a minute x 1,595PSI)Attachments included: single spray lance, dirt blaster lanceWarranty: five years\nPS219 at Just LawnmowersPS224.99 at Charlies\nMoving from corded to cordless washers usually incurs an increase in cost and a decrease in pressure. But while the mega battery for Stihl's Rea 60 Plus is pricey, it can push out water at pressures that rival corded tools.\nWhy we love itDuring testing, the Rea 60 Plus surprised me with its high pressure, which is closer to corded levels than the other battery-powered washers we tested. Although full-pelt washing diminishes the battery rapidly, Stihl has added a power dial that lets you tame the jet. That means you can wash at a lower pressure for longer, and this lower pressure is useful for more delicate tasks as well. You can also control the flow with the handy nozzle, which lets you choose between three jet types (fan, rotary and cleaning agent, with the latter fed from a hose on the side of the main unit).\nWhat I really admired about the Rea 60 Plus was how neatly it all packs away, largely thanks to its pressure hose reel. When you start you can just pull out what you need, up to its 5m length. The storage clips for the dismantled lance and gun and the lack of a power cord also help keep things neat and tidy.\nIt's a shame that ... although the Rea 60 Plus is affordable, it doesn't come with a battery or charger, which adds another PS197 to the cost.\nSuitable for: patio, decking/fences, garden tools, garden furniture, drains/guttering, vehicles, away from homePressure hose length: 5mWeight: 6.7kgCorded or cordless: cordlessQuoted battery run time: 25minsCleaning power: 8,485 cleaning units (4.5 litres a minute x 1,885PSI) Attachments included: 3-in-1 nozzleWarranty: three years\nPS135 at B&QPS128.25 at Amazon\nThe Bosch UniversalAquatak 135 is a corded pressure washer that offers a good balance between high pressure, reasonable price and usable design.\nWhy we love itWith a high maximum pressure and a high flow rate, the cleaning power of the UniversalAquatak 135 isn't really in question. In my tests it quickly lifted dirt from every surface I pointed it at.\nThere's a little assembly to be done but it's nothing too arduous and doesn't require any tools: it's just a case of clipping the wheels on to the unit and assembling the handle mechanism. Despite having wheels, it's not particularly large or heavy, so there's no problem lifting it and carrying it around.\nIt comes with a single nozzle that can be rotated to select one of three jet settings - fan, rotary and pencil - to provide various pressures to suit your requirements.\nIt's a shame that ... I found the long 7m pressure hose had a strong desire to stay curled up, and it doesn't have the extendable lance or extra-long warranty of the Ava P40.\nSuitable for: patio, decking/fences, garden tools, garden furniture, drains/guttering, vehiclesPressure hose length: 7mWeight: 6.9kgCorded or cordless: cordedCleaning power: 14,685 cleaning units (7.5 litres a minute x 1,958PSI) Attachments included: 3-in-1 nozzle, 450ml detergent nozzleWarranty: three years\nSign up to The Filter\nGet the best shopping advice from the Filter team straight to your inbox.

In the garden, you can connect your hose directly to the lance, so there's no pressure hose to worry about, but you do then have to drag your hose around. I didn't find this to be any more of a problem than using it for regular watering, though.\nIt comes with its own hose, too, which you can connect up and dip into any water supply, further enhancing its portability. This would be great for washing down equipment after a boating trip, for example, where there's a plentiful supply of water. You could also use it with captured rainwater from a water butt or similar.\nIt didn't make the final cut because ... it doesn't provide the same kind of pressure as the winners, although it's certainly the right tool for the right job. The lack of pressure wasn't particularly apparent in my cleaning tests, but you will notice it when tackling the toughest jobs.\nSuitable for: patio, decking/fences, garden tools, garden furniture, drains/guttering, vehicles, bikes, away from home; pressure hose length: N/A; weight: 2.7kg; corded or cordless: cordless; quoted battery runtime: 24mins; cleaning power: 1,091 cleaning units (3 litres a minute x 360PSI); attachments included: 3-in-1 nozzle, 6m siphoning hose, 18V battery and charger; warranty: three years\nPS391 (including battery and charger) at BoschPS177.95 (no battery) at Amazon\nBest for: an affordable cordless pressure washer\nThis battery-powered Bosch sits somewhere between the Stihl and the Ryobi in terms of its cleaning power. It doesn't have the full-pelt power of the Stihl but it's more affordable. And while not quite as portable as the Ryobi, it does at least have the option of portability, whether you're using it around the garden or flinging it in the car to take elsewhere.\nIt comes with much the same equipment as the mains-powered Bosch, including the handy three-in-one nozzle and a clip-on detergent tank you can use to quickly cover a dirty item in cleaning foam.\nIt didn't make the final cut because ... it's not quite as portable as the Ryobi or as neat as the Stihl.\nSuitable for: patio, decking/fences, garden tools, garden furniture, vehicles, away from home; pressure hose length: 4m; weight: 4.7kg; corded or cordless: cordless; quoted battery run time: 45mins; cleaning power: 4,496 cleaning units (3.1 litres a minute x 1,450PSI); attachments included: 3-in-1 nozzle; warranty: three years\nPS130 at ArgosPS129 at Amazon\nBest for: a better-built version of the K 2\nIf you've got a little more to spend than the sub-PS100 for the K 2, then the K 3 is a level up in build quality. The pressure and flow rate are improved, so you get a more powerful clean, though I didn't notice a huge difference in my tests. However, the device itself is a definite step up, with a longer pressure hose, wheels for dragging it about and an extendable handle.\nOtherwise, it's largely the same as the K 2, but better balanced and less prone to falling over.\nIt didn't make the final cut because ... if you're moving up from the K 2 and can afford it, the Ava P40 and the Bosch UniversalAquatak 135 are better options for only a few pounds more.\nSuitable for: patio, decking/fences, garden tools, garden furniture, vehicles; pressure hose length: 6m; weight: 3.8kg; corded or cordless: corded; cleaning power: 11,023 cleaning units (6.3 litres a minute x 1,740PSI); attachments included: single spray lance, dirt blaster lance; warranty: five years\nPS79.99 at Screwfix\nBest for: affordable power\nThe Titan TTB1800PRW from Screwfix is a no-nonsense pressure washer that's affordable and powerful. In fact, it's the most powerful washer I tested, yet is available from Screwfix for less than PS100, with only the less powerful Karcher K 2 Classic beating it on price.\nOnce I'd assembled the washer (see below) it made short work of the cleaning tasks I set it. It comes with two nozzles and I generally preferred the power nozzle over the other, as it did a significantly better job of lifting off dirt. It was also the only model to come with a patio cleaning brush tool, though I found this to be too light to be of much use and preferred the roto nozzle during testing.\nIt didn't make the final cut because ... it took more assembly than any others, requiring a screwdriver to put together some of the parts. I didn't like the extendable handle: it doesn't lock into place and can catch you out when reaching to pick it up.\nSuitable for: patio, garden tools, vehicles; pressure hose length: 6m; weight: 7.1kg; corded or cordless: corded; cleaning power: 14,891cleaning units (7.3 litres a minute x 2,031PSI); attachments included: vario fan nozzle, roto nozzle, patio cleaner; warranty: two years\nPressure washers are simple tools that accept water from a water supply, build up the pressure using an electric motor, and then squirt out the water again from a gun attached to a separate hose (called a pressure hose).\nAll the washers I tested use a universal garden hose attachment that lets them easily hook up to your water supply. My garden hose has a Hozelock connector, which fitted perfectly on to every model, so check yours is compatible. Once the water is connected and the tap is on, you can power up the washer either by connecting it to the mains or charging and slotting in a battery.\nThen you simply select an appropriate attachment or setting, depending on the pressure you want, and point it at the dirt. The gun has a trigger so you can start and stop the water as you please without returning to the main unit or closing the tap.\nKeep in mind that dirt and debris can fly around when squirted at high pressure. Safety glasses, long trousers and proper shoes should be worn. Gloves are a good idea, and you might want to deck yourself out in some waterproof clothing.\nDifferent jobs require different amounts of pressure. Heavy-duty dirty work, such as blasting a concrete paving slab, is best done with high-pressure washers that can produce pressure in excess of 100 bar (1,450PSI). You can get decent results from lower-pressure washers, too, but it might take a bit longer.\nSofter surfaces, such as wooden fencing and decking, shouldn't be attacked with the highest pressure settings of a powerful washer but can be hosed down with a less powerful spray. Washers with pressure of less than 100 bar can be used for this kind of thing. Try your washer on a small and inconspicuous area first to see how it fares before tackling the whole thing.\nSome jobs are best done with the pressure at a minimum, such as washing your car. Although you can still use a pressure washer for this, you should use a rinse setting, or a fan setting from a safe distance - the pressure is most intense at the tip of the nozzle. Pressure washers with foam cannon are good for covering a car with soap, which you can then rinse after it's lifted off some of the dirt. Don't mix detergent with your pressure washer's main water supply, though, as this can damage the device.\nNone of the pressure washers I've reviewed here were particularly noisy. Your nextdoor neighbour will notice when you're using one, but they're quieter than lawnmowers and hedge trimmers. There's no requirement to wear ear defenders.\nAndy Shaw is a freelance consumer journalist and technology addict.

There are millions of people around the world who could help make the world a better place, but don't. I'm talking about the ones who have got the power to shape their own careers, though you would never know it from their utterly unsurprising resumes. About the talented folks with the world at their feet who nonetheless get stuck in mind-numbing, pointless or just plain harmful jobs.\nThere's an antidote to that kind of waste, and it's called moral ambition. Moral ambition is the will to make the world a wildly better place. To devote your working life to the great challenges of our time, whether that's the climate crisis or corruption, gross inequality or the next pandemic. It's a longing to make a difference - and to build a legacy that truly matters.\nMoral ambition begins with a simple realisation: you've only got one life. The time you have left on this Earth is your most precious possession. You can't buy yourself more time, and every hour you've spent is gone for ever. A full-time career consists of 80,000 hours, or 10,000 workdays, or 2,000 workweeks. How you spend that time is one of the most important moral decisions of your life.\nSo what do you want on your resume? Do you go for a respectable, if bland, list? Or do you set the bar higher? Morally ambitious individuals don't move with the herd, but believe in a deeper form of freedom. It's the freedom to push aside conventional standards of success, to make your own way along life's path, knowing that it's a journey you can only make once.\nThose looking to do some good in today's world don't have to look far. Still reeling from a global pandemic, we're seeing hunger surge for the first time in years. Meanwhile, autocrats are on the rise, while the number of people forced to flee their homes has topped 100 million for the first time. And as temperatures hit one record high after another, climate scientists are stressing the need for \"the biggest and most fundamental transformation\" of society ever attempted in peacetime.\nIn short: these times call for moral ambition.\nNow, you might be thinking: that's all well and good, but I've got a full-time job, two kids and a mortgage. I'm happy to recycle and eat some tofu now and then, but a \"fundamental transformation\"? No thanks.\nIn that case, moral ambition may not be for you. I mean, once you have a labradoodle, a set of cheese knives or a robot mower, there's generally no going back. But if that's irritating to hear - and I imagine it might be - then by all means, prove me wrong. I have learned that there are always exceptions, and I want to show that you can be that exception. It's never too late to step up.\nLet's start with a simple model of what you can do with your talents. Whether you've got your whole career ahead of you or are looking to make a change, it seems to me you've got roughly four options:\nSome jobs simply don't add much value. These are people writing reports nobody reads or managing colleagues who don't need managing. Recent research shows about 8% of all employees think their own job is pretty pointless. Another 17% confess to having some doubts about whether their job contributes to society.\nThe late anthropologist David Graeber (1961-2020) had a highly technical term for such positions: bullshit jobs. What jobs are we talking about here? Well, we know which ones they're not. In 2020, at the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, lists of \"essential workers\" popped up everywhere: from cleaning staff to street sweepers, teachers to firefighters, bus drivers to nurses. These are the people who keep the world running; they don't need a lecture on moral ambition.\nBut there's also a class of not-so-useful jobs. A class of influencers and marketeers, lobbyists and managers, consultants and corporate lawyers - all people who could go on strike and the world would be just fine. Remarkably enough, this group includes many men and women with impressive credentials and equally impressive salaries. Reminds me of that Facebook employee who said, \"The best minds of my generation are thinking about how to make people click ads.\"\nFor some in this not-all-that-ambitious, not-all-that-idealistic category, there's an escape hatch: becoming financially independent. Countless self-help books lay out how to get rich with minimal effort, so you can get out as soon as possible, then kick back and relax. Loads of people in their 20s or 30s now dream of accumulating passive income - from shares, cryptocurrency or real estate - so they can \"earn\" enough to retire early.\nNothing wrong with having some savings and investments, of course. But at its core, this kind of thinking always seems a little sad to me. It means you're chasing a form of freedom where you won't have to lift a finger. The dream is to make the transition from office serf to modern-day feudal lord - living off passive income while other people do the actual work.\nThe second category of wasted talent consists of people who are ambitious but not so idealistic. Or, put another way, these people want to reach the top, but use soulless indicators for success: a fancy title, a fat salary, a corner office or other perks.\nTake graduates from the world's most prestigious universities. Approximately 45% of Harvard alumni go into finance or consulting. A poll from a few years back shows that in my country, the Netherlands, 40% of \"high achievers\" (college students with excellent grades) aspire to work for major consulting firms such as McKinsey or the Boston Consulting Group.\nWe're talking colossal waste of talent here. Economist Benjamin Lockwood, who studied at Amherst, the elite private college in Massachusetts, noticed many of his fellow students went into fields with no clear added value to society. In 2017, Lockwood and two colleagues published a groundbreaking study showing many of those former classmates now cost society money. (Think banking execs who need bailing out with public money.)\nA corporate lawyer, for instance, does $30,000 of damage to society each year, a commercial banker more than $100,000. That's a lot of money, but if you ask Lockwood, he stresses that the opportunity costs are much higher. That's economic jargon for: just think how much better shape our world would be in if these bright people had done something useful with their careers.\nTake consultants. These talented people are at best helping others be a little more productive. They don't start new organisations, don't come up with new innovations and generally don't concern themselves with the most pressing challenges facing us today.\nIf you're among the top in your field, you can afford to go skiing regularly or buy that beach house you always dreamed of. But is that really all you want out of life? Surely there's more to it. Many young consultants, according to the Financial Times a few years back, \"feel they add little value to the world and lack a sense of personal growth, community and purpose\".\nThings aren't much different for many entrepreneurs. I was scrolling through lists of successful startups recently and spotted a couple of inspired initiatives - a company working on cultivated meat, an enterprise building a solar-powered car and an organisation developing a nasal spray that protects against viruses. Very promising stuff.\nBut more often than not, we're offered solutions for problems we didn't know we had. Take the category \"best young entrepreneurs\", where I came across the firm offering an electric toothbrush-head subscription. Or yet another food delivery app, a personalised vitamin service, or that mattress startup that advertised on every podcast in my feed a while back.\nNow, I don't have anything against mattresses, and getting a new head for my toothbrush in the mail every other month sounds handy, honestly. But you've got to wonder what the founders of companies like these could have achieved if they'd taken on a challenge like, I don't know, the 5.4 million infants and children worldwide who die each year from diseases we can easily - easily! - prevent.\nWhat if they'd put their talent towards something that really mattered?\nAnd then there's a third category, made up of people who are idealistic, but not that ambitious. It's a combination often seen in gen Z - people born since 1996. Many young people are far more idealistic than their parents and are focused on a number of the big challenges of our day, whether that's the climate crisis or racism, sexual harassment or inequality.\nBut something seems to be missing. You see it in young people's take on their careers: with no interest in joining the capitalist rat race, many want work they're passionate about - and preferably part-time. Sometimes it seems \"ambition\" has become a dirty word, incompatible with an idealistic lifestyle. Many people are more preoccupied with the kind of work they do than with the impact that work has. As long as it feels good. \"Small is beautiful,\" you'll hear. Or \"think global, act local\" - as if achieving little is somehow a virtue.\nIn some circles, you'd think the highest good is not to have any impact at all. A good life is defined by what you don't do. Don't fly. Don't eat meat. Don't have kids. And don't even think about using a plastic straw. Reduce! Reduce! Reduce! The aim is to have the smallest footprint possible, with your little veg garden and your tiny house. Best-case scenario? Your impact on the planet is so negligible, you could just as well not have existed.\nDon't get me wrong - it's a fine idea to align even your smallest deeds with your biggest values. (And not eating meat from factory farms seems to me a moral minimum.) But surely a good life consists of more than what you don't do? One would hope that on your deathbed, you can chalk up your life's work to more than simply all the harm you didn't cause?\nSeen this way, even the most moralistic movement shows a serious lack of ambition. I'm talking about those called \"woke\". Often accused of going too far, woke activists in many cases don't go far enough. Take the preoccupation with the words we use to describe the world. Yes, words matter, and to some extent even shape our reality. But in the end, what you do matters far more.\nIf we look at the concrete successes of these kinds of activists, the results seem meagre. True, you can reach millions these days in no time with an online rant against sexism, racism or capitalism. Kill the patriarchy! Defund the police! Tax the rich! But what happens next? Having lots of followers on Instagram isn't the same as building an effective organisation. Going viral isn't the same as winning a majority in the legislature.\nSign up to Inside Saturday\nThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine. Sign up to get the inside story from our top writers as well as all the must-read articles and columns, delivered to your inbox every weekend.\nafter newsletter promotion\nFor actual change, far more is required. How do you build a coalition? How do you lobby effectively? Where's the money coming from? Who plays a key role in that commission at local, state or national level? How can you find out what buttons to push, and when? And who has the knowhow to tweak legislation in clever ways?\nThe trouble with idealists who lack ambition is they tend to prize awareness more than action. But here's the thing: awareness alone won't help a soul. It's at best a starting point, while for many activists, it seems to have become the end goal.\nIs there another way? Say you take the ambition of a high-flyer and add a generous dose of idealism. What do you get?\nLet me introduce one of my personal heroes, the British author and activist Thomas Clarkson. In 1785, as a 24-year-old university student, Clarkson decided to enter an essay contest in Latin at the University of Cambridge. To take part, he had to answer a short question: Anne liceat invitos in servitutem dare?\nThat is: Is it OK to force others into slavery?\nAt the time, winning a Latin essay contest was the way to make a name for yourself at university. \"I had no motive but that which other young men in the university had on such occasions,\" Clarkson would later recall, \"namely the wish of being distinguished, or obtaining literary honour.\"\nThere was just one small problem: Clarkson didn't know a thing about slavery. Students had two months to put their thoughts to paper, and while most only started to feel the pressure once the deadline was imminent, Clarkson was different. He got straight to work.\nThe earnest student thought he would enjoy the research process. But the facts hit hard. \"In the daytime I was uneasy. In the night I had little rest. I sometimes never closed my eyelids for grief.\"\nA few weeks of hard work later, his essay was finished. In powerful prose, Clarkson concluded that slavery was \"contrary to reason, justice, nature, the principles of law and government ... and the revealed voice of God\". And, you guessed it: he won first place. Clarkson was invited to present his winning essay in the majestic Senate House at the University of Cambridge. There he stood, a towering young man with fiery hair and bright eyes. All signs indicated Thomas Clarkson had a glorious career ahead of him.\nBut on the way back to London, he couldn't get the subject of his essay out of his head. He got down from his horse and walked, distracted. He tried to convince himself he'd made some mistake, that the grisly facts couldn't be right. But the longer he thought about it, the deeper the truth sunk in.\nWhen the little village of Wade's Mill came into view, he stopped and sat down, glum, at the side of the road. \"Here a thought came into my mind,\" he would later write, \"that if the contents of the essay were true, then it was time some person should see these calamities to their end.\" If the end of the global slave trade started anywhere, it started here, at the side of the road outside Wade's Mill.\nOf course, there had been others who protested against the most heinous forms of slavery. And certainly, history is filled with acts of resistance by enslaved people, who time and again worked to throw off their chains. But the fact of the matter is that for centuries, victims of the system weren't able to overthrow that system. The very notion of abolitionism, the idea that the whole institution of slavery could be abolished once and for all, long seemed unthinkable.\nOne evening, at a dinner with a few other abolitionists, Clarkson made a decision. The young man knew someone had to dedicate their life to the fight against slavery, and so he stood up and announced to everyone there, \"I'm ready to devote myself to the cause.\"\nThat may sound a little melodramatic. And if you read Clarkson's memoirs today, you can't help but think, Easy there, Clarkson, you seem mighty impressed with yourself. But make no mistake, idealism often comes with a shot of vanity. With many a world-saver, it's tough to say where the idealism ends and the vanity begins. But real-world deeds are more important than intentions, and when it came down to it, the ambitious college student kept his word. For the rest of his life, for 61 more years, he continued to fight for his ideals.\nIn 1787, Clarkson became one of the 12 founders of the Society for the Abolition of the Slave Trade. Ten of the others were entrepreneurs. Go through their archives today and you'll find to-do lists, action plans. While the French abolitionist movement was led by writers and intellectuals (and didn't get much done), the British movement was run by merchants and businessmen.\nAfter a years-long campaign, the UK officially banned the slave trade in 1807 - at a time of peak profits, no less. The British then forced other countries out. The Royal Navy launched the \"blockade of Africa\", where they captured 2,000 slaving vessels and freed those aboard.\n\"In the end,\" two experts estimate, \"direct British efforts accounted for eliminating 80% of the slave trade.\" From 1807 to 1867, the British put an astronomical amount of money into enforcing the ban: nearly 2% of the national income, or four times the UK's current foreign aid budget. The researchers speak of the \"most costly international moral action in modern history\".\nThe historian Christopher Leslie Brown - one of the foremost experts on British abolitionism - was once asked who the most consequential individual was in the British anti-slavery movement. Brown answered that, at the start of his career, he was determined not to give too much attention to individual heroes. He wanted to focus on the structural causes of abolitionism. But the more time he spent with the archives, the more he realised some individuals did have outsized influence - Thomas Clarkson in particular. \"As far as the movement goes,\" Brown said, \"Clarkson is essential to what ends up emerging.\" Clarkson grew to be one of the greatest reformers of his time. What the apostle Paul was to Christianity, and Martin Luther to the Reformation, Clarkson was to abolitionism. A \"moral steam engine\", a contemporary called him, a \"giant with one idea\".\nI've spent years researching the Clarksons of our time: activists and entrepreneurs, doctors and lawyers, engineers and innovators, all bursting with moral ambition. What they have in common is a refusal to see their own deeds as drops in the ocean. They believe they can make a difference and are prepared to take risks to get there. They don't just think, \"Someone should do something about that\" but take action themselves.\nWhat many of these people also share is a certain degree of privilege. Not everyone can devote their life to the world's biggest problems. Clarkson could never have been a full-time abolitionist without the inheritance his father left him. Still, people suffering from poverty and illness, racism and sexism can move mountains, too. Helen Keller (1880-1968) was blind and deaf, and became a renowned advocate for people with disabilities. Malcolm X (1925-1965) grew up in deep poverty and became an iconic leader in the struggle for civil rights.\nTrue, people with moral ambition often pay a price for their ideals. Malcolm X paid with his life. And even for those blessed with long lives, moral ambition can take its toll. Clarkson travelled 35,000 miles in seven years - on horseback, and often at night - to bring his pamphlets and petitions to the people. At 33, he suffered a nervous breakdown, or what we'd now call burnout. Year in, year out, he'd filled his brain with the horrors of slavery, in facts and figures and brutal images. \"I am often seized with giddiness and cramps,\" Clarkson wrote in his journal. \"I feel an unpleasant ringing in my ears, my hands tremble. Cold sweats come upon me.\"\nSo no, Clarkson wasn't exactly mindful, and should have done his breathing exercises. It's in nobody's interest for the folks making the world a better place to collapse at 33 and have to be carried off mid-fight. But at least he didn't get burned out from scrolling through never-ending spreadsheets or sitting through yet another PowerPoint. \"I was therefore obliged, though very reluctantly,\" he wrote in his memoirs, \"to be borne out of the field where I had placed the great honour and glory of my life.\"\nSo ask yourself the question: what's the \"great honour and glory\" of your life? What do you hope one day to look back on? \"A person of honour cares first of all not about being respected,\" writes the philosopher Kwame Anthony Appiah, \"but about being worthy of respect.\" Your honour is not the same as your reputation. It's not about looking good; it's about doing good.\nOne thing's for sure. If you want to lead a morally ambitious life, there's no time like the present. Fear of change is often the first sign of ageing, and before you know it, you're in golden handcuffs: stuck in a ho-hum job with no time to spare and all your money earmarked for things like that toothbrush-head subscription.\nBut make the leap and the possibilities are endless. Because so many others waste their talents, people with moral ambition can make a world of difference.\n This is an edited extract from Moral Ambition by Rutger Bregman, published by Bloomsbury on 24 April at PS20.

      "content": "UK brands are finding ever-inventive ways to quench consumers' thirst for non-dairy alternatives\nWith white-suited operatives tapping buttons on huge machines and its walls a tangle of heavy-duty pipes, the sprawling complex in the Northamptonshire countryside could pass for a Bond villain's lair, were it not for the comforting porridge smell.\nBut rather than plotting world domination, the site's owner, Navara Oat Milling, is piggybacking on Britons' growing thirst for plant-based alternatives to dairy. At regular intervals, trucks loaded with up to 30 tonnes of oat flour trundle eight miles up the road to the Alpro factory in Kettering, which churns out over 200m litres of plant milk a year.\nThe decision by Alpro's French owner, Danone, to switch to using British oats rather than an imported syrup in its main oat drink range is the latest in a wave of innovations as plant-based food makers write a new chapter after the boom-and-bust story of the past 10 years.\nDuring the cost of living crisis, shoppers turned away from pricey dairy and meat alternatives. In the squeeze that followed, retailers cut shelf space for such products and some high-profile names went under. Meatless Farm, for example, ceased trading before being rescued from administration.\nNow the worst appears over, for dairy alternatives anyway, not least because Britons are pairing plant milk with another expensive habit - coffee. Today, one in four coffees sold by the major chains is made with it, with oat the No 1 choice.\nSupermarket sales data shows shoppers are putting more of it in their baskets for the first time since 2022. In the year to February 2025, sales volumes were up 2.1% on the previous 12-month period, and oat milk romped ahead with growth of 7.2%, according to data firm Kantar. Just under 35% of UK households consume plant-based drinks, it says.\nAs plant-based food brands regroup, marketers are looking for new ways to win over shoppers. The fast-growing Plenish brand is billing itself as the \"UK's only clean-label fortified m*lk with no oils and additives\", while to stand out against UHT rivals, Oato launched \"fresh\" oat milk last year. To make plant milks more affordable, both Alpro and Oatly have introduced cheaper 500ml packs.\nWith the Navara mill processing oats grown within 80 miles, Alpro's decision to play the British card stands out in a market where the other big brands produce overseas. Last year, Oatly shelved plans for a factory in Peterborough, and to hammer the point home the Alpro carton is emblazoned with union jacks.\nIn more exuberant times, supermarket chiller cabinets bulged with plant milks, with incumbents such as soya, oat and almond pitted against pea, potato and all manner of nuts. But oat won out and annual sales top PS275m, up from PS155m five years ago. This year, oat will make up 40% of the market on a volume basis, with half a million litres sold each day in the UK.\nAnalysts say that oat has emerged victorious due to its superior taste and because consumers see the ingredient as recognisable and healthy.\nWhile the hi-tech Navara mill cost over PS50m, James Skidmore, managing director, says the milling process children learned about watching Windy Miller in the classic TV show Camberwick Green has hardly changed.\n\"How you manufacture oat flour or flakes from raw oats is fundamentally the same,\" he says. However, heavy investment in automation means Navara can make adjustments to produce a consistent raw material.\nTo change the Alpro recipe, Danone made a multimillion-pound investment in the Kettering site, buying the machinery required to turn the flour into the \"oat juice\" that is the new base ingredient for its oat drinks.\nAfter research showed that half of plant-based shoppers are driven by health, Alpro is trumpeting the fact that its new recipe is low fat, high in fibre and bolstered with vitamins and minerals. However, Tom Kerr, Danone's head of category management and commercial planning - plant-based, says customers also just like how it tastes. \"A lot of people prefer an oat flat white v a dairy flat white from a taste point of view.\"\nKey to the success of plant-based foods is for brands to be \"really clear and consistent in the health messaging around it\", Kerr believes, pointing to lessons learned from the travails of alt-meat. \"It was such an explosion, it almost became overwhelming for shoppers to understand what the benefit is. We are trying to make consistent improvements and be very clear about the health benefit.\"\nWhile bestselling brands like Oatly have gone into battle with dairy, citing oat's lower climate impact, for consumers it is not an either-or situation. Nine out of 10 plant-milk buyers stack it beside cow's milk. That left higher-priced dairy alternatives vulnerable during the cost of living crisis, when shoppers balked at paying for two kinds of the same product.\nOne solution has been smaller pack sizes: \"We wanted to create options at a lower absolute price points so smaller households or single-user households can still have it,\" says Danone's Tom Kerr.\nKiti Soininen at Mintel thinks plant-based milk will be a long-term growth story, thanks to its young customer base. While only 14% of over-45s use plant-based milk, nearly twice as many under-45s drink it, Mintel's research shows. \"There's little reason to think younger consumers will abandon their now-familiar option,\" he says. \"Many children are growing up with oat and nut milks in the family fridge, with a quarter of parents of under-16s using plant-based milk.\"\nA limiting factor is cost, as although plant milk is increasingly included in supermarket promotions, it is still more expensive than cow's milk. But comparing a generic pint of cow's milk with a trendy oat milk brand is not a fair comparison, says Thijs Geijer, an economist at ING Research. For a start, the UK cow's milk market is 10 times the size of plant-based.\n\"You pay a premium for the brand,\" says Geijer. \"Brands use that to invest in things like innovation and marketing. Manufacturing is not necessarily expensive, but in producing milk, dairy companies profit from their economies of scale and sell a range of other dairy products that are more profitable than milk. Milk in supermarkets is really commoditised - high volume but low margins.\"\nInterestingly, while dairy alternatives are often discussed as a way to combat the climate crisis, the drink's environmental impact is not the main reason people pick it up - perceptions that it is a \"healthier choice\", suitable for allergy sufferers, and tasty score higher as reasons to buy in Mintel's polling.\nIndeed, the environmental impact of food and drink is of low importance when it comes to people's choices, says Soininen; how it tastes and how much it costs are by far the most important things.\n\"The category has not escaped the recent spotlight on ultra-processed foods (UPFs), with dairy alternatives widely seen as highly processed,\" she adds. \"However, these views are not a major deterrent.\"",
      "ml_hf_summary": "The UK plant-based milk market is experiencing significant growth, driven by consumer demand for healthier and more sustainable options.  Alpro, owned by Danone, has switched to using British oats in its oat drink range, marking a shift away from imported syrups. This decision follows a trend of increased investment in the sector, with brands like Oatly and Alpro introducing smaller pack sizes and focusing on taste and health benefits. Sales data shows that oat milk is now the top choice for plant-based drinks, accounting for 40% of the market volume.  While environmental impact plays a role in consumer choices, factors such as taste and affordability remain key drivers. The UK's dairy industry faces challenges from the rise of plant-based alternatives, but remains a significant player in the market. \n"

      "content": "Enjoy a new way of cooking with abundant herbs and nuts, as they do in the South Caucasus, with chicken in a white wine and walnut sauce, and a citrus and walnut salad\nThe South Caucasus is a region that has taught me just how much can be done with herbs and nuts. Intensely fresh and fragrant, herbs are used liberally in Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia, and never as an afterthought or as mere garnish. In fact, entire bunches of basil, coriander and tarragon will often accompany grilled and roast meat from springtime right through to autumn, while bulgur salad is always more leaf than wheat; sorbet may be basil and soda is often tarragon, too. Walnuts are another mainstay of kitchens throughout the region, where they go into salads and cakes and, perhaps best of all, are ground into thick, rich sauces.\nAt a restaurant in Dilijan, northern Armenia, we ate roast chicken that, given its wine and walnut sauce, had a distinctly Georgian flavour. I suggest keeping things simple and serving this with just a green salad, a plate of sliced tomatoes or a cucumber and herb salad.\nPrep 5 min\n Cook 1 hr 30 min\n Serves 4\n1 whole free-range chicken without giblets (about 1 1/2kg)\n Juice of 1/2 lemon, shell reserved\n 1 tbsp olive oil\n 1 1/2 tsp sea salt flakesBlack pepper\n 1/2 tsp sweet paprika\n 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes\nFor the sauce60g walnuts\n 1 large garlic clove, peeled and roughly chopped 1/2 tsp ground coriander 1/4 tsp ground blue fenugreek\n 1/2 tsp ground cumin\n Juice of 1/2 lemon\n 100m hot chicken stock\n 2 tbsp white wine\nHeat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/400F/gas 6. Cut away and discard any fat from around the cavity of the chicken. Pour over the lemon juice, drizzle with the oil and season the bird inside and out. Sprinkle over the spices, then put the squeezed-out lemon half into the cavity.\nLay the chicken breast side down in a roasting tin, then roast for an hour, until the juices run clear when you pierce the thickest part of the thigh and there is no pinkness to the meat.

      "content": "The pressure's off when we're not staring at each other, we can relax and have a nice chat\nOn the day after Boxing Day last year, my dad and I went to buy some cabbage. My aunt and cousins were joining us for dinner that evening and we had a meal to prepare. The local supermarket was closed and the cabbage, sourced from an Italian deli around the corner, was obscenely overpriced. In a bind, we bought some anyway and headed back home to begin cooking. Standing around the kitchen island chopping and peeling vegetables, preparing a rib of beef and assembling a side dish of dauphinoise potatoes, we listened to music and chatted. The meal was a success and the cabbage - lightly browned and decorated with caraway seeds - tasty. But most important was that, for the time we had spent cooking, I felt closer to my dad.\nThis kind of intimacy almost always occurs for me while I'm cooking with someone. When I was 14, I was paired with a classmate in food technology where we were tasked with making a meal from scratch. We decided on a menu of jerk chicken, rice and peas. For practice, we gathered a group of friends at my house and, after procuring our ingredients, got to work. The results of our efforts were average, but that joint experience of clumsily blitzing fiery scotch bonnet peppers, onions, garlic and various sauces into a clumpy and barely edible mess cemented our friendship.\nA year later, when my parents separated, cooking elaborate meals with my mum helped me feel less redundant in a situation that was out of my control. We'd make Caesar salads with homemade dressing (using creme fraiche instead of egg yolks), my mum toasting croutons as I bashed anchovies and garlic with a mortar and pestle, or spend hours slowly cooking rich ragu. In my mind at least, I was offering a sense of companionship that she may have felt was missing.\nLater, when my dad remarried, cooking with my stepsister - making everything from fried chicken to parmesan custard served with anchovy toast - solidified our bond as siblings. When I visited her recently in Newcastle, the whole trip revolved around the food we prepared: blackened fish and Old Bay-seasoned corn on the cob on one night, miso-butter mushrooms on another.\nThen there's my dad. He's a man of few words, but when we cook together we discuss films, music and books and update each other on our lives while chopping onions, preparing salads or making recipes from A Taste of Our Cooking, a book of traditional Ismaili recipes. One dish in particular, a chicken pilau spiced with cumin, cloves and cardamon pods, reminds me of the food that my grandmother, who lived with us growing up, used to take to the mosque to share with others. Cooking it with my dad takes me back to that time. I'm often relegated to sous chef, but it's our time together and I cherish it.\n\"Food is at the centre of human connections,\" explains Charlotte Hastings, a psychotherapist and the author of Kitchen Therapy, a book which explores the psychological, social and spiritual aspects of food. \"That's how we began as a species: by making and enjoying food together. The way we cook gives us a way of expressing love between one another.\"\nHastings uses the shared language of cooking and food as a way to explore personal and interpersonal issues with her patients. It's a technique, she says, that means she can move from emotionally difficult areas people are discussing to, say, whisking eggs, while drawing connections between their feelings and the food they're preparing. \"It allows us to stay in the room and not run away from those feelings, while not staying in a dangerous place for too long with people. It's an effective way of working with trauma.\"\nWhile the intimacy I find in cooking with friends and family doesn't always involve spilling our deepest held secrets or emotional pain, She suggests that the active nature of preparing food means the pressure or anxiety some people may feel in one-on-one conversation slip away. \"We're feeling that sense of being unified,\" she says. \"You don't have to be having really big, meaningful conversations to come away feeling sustained and nourished in those moments.\"\nDr Michael Kocet, assistant vice-chancellor for graduate education at the University of College Denver and a mental health counsellor who developed a graduate course that trains people how to use cooking in a therapeutic setting, agrees that cooking together creates a less threatening environment than sitting down face-to-face for a chat. \"Research shows, especially with men and adolescents and boys, that parents often find their child opens up when they're driving in the car. Why? Well, it's because they're not making eye contact. They're focusing ahead, and that eye contact is less threatening,\" he says. \"It's the same thing with cooking. It's less intimidating, less vulnerable, because you're focusing on a task of chopping or stirring or having a common activity together.\"\nHaving recently moved away from my family in London to live alone in Sheffield, I've found that cooking together with friends has also often soothed those moments where I've felt lonely or isolated. \"I think food is a binding opportunity,\" Kocet says. \"It brings friends together. It might not even be about being a good chef. I think it's just a way to foster community.\"\nLeeds-based charity Zest is putting this into practice with its social enterprise Leeds Cookery School. Using profits made from hosting cookery classes for local foodies and hiring out their kitchens for corporate away days and private events, they offer a range of free-to-access community projects centred around education about health eating and the preparation and sharing of food. \"Food crosses all barriers, languages and demographics,\" says Joe Grant, who works as the charity's head of social enterprise. \"I could be sitting next to you and we could be talking in different languages. But if we were to cook a meal together and share it, there would be smiles, there would be laughter, there would be a connection, and there would be a bond that's made.\"\nGrant highlights two of the programmes that the organisation runs: the Men's Pie Club, an initiative which was first set up by Newcastle-based social enterprise Food Nation that aims to combat social isolation among men of all ages, and the Welcome Cafe, Leeds, a community cooking session for refugees and asylum seekers living in the area.\n\"The premise of the Pie Club is that socially isolated men can come to a session once a week, roll up their sleeves, make some pastry and a filling and produce a pie,\" Grant says. \"But the kinaesthetic act is somewhat secondary because they are having conversations. The pies just get made along the way.\" He shares one story about a man who arrived at his first session with low confidence and social anxiety. \"But since coming to the pie club, we saw that person come out of their shell,\" Grant says. \"Before too long, they were showing participants what to do and now that person is leading sessions.\" Many of the men also go on to build friendships outside cooking. \"They have a WhatsApp group. They go home and share their success and failures in pie making. It doesn't have to be about in-depth chats. They're making connections with people.\"\nThis is the ethos behind the Welcome Cafe, too. Each week one person decides what the group will cook and they stroll through Leeds Kirkgate Market to pick up ingredients before heading back to the kitchens in the market to prepare a meal. \"We have people from Somalia, Algeria, Hong Kong,\" Grant says. \"It's just so international and varied. There's 18 to 80-year-olds and so many different personalities. They all chip in and it's this one big community meal.\"\nDespite the obvious benefits of sharing food together, a 2021 survey conducted by Sainsbury's found that only 28% of households eat the same meal at dinnertime, with 55% saying they struggle to find the time to dine together. Meanwhile, a 2016 study found that parents of 1.5 million families in the UK had never cooked with their children. Hastings puts this down to the separation of our minds and our bodies. \"Obviously class and gender play into this, but I think in a capitalist culture we've lost the spiritual structure of making food as an act of love and communication. There's this real disconnect around what the purpose of eating is,\" she says. \"It is difficult when people don't have enough time, but we need to ask ourselves why we don't have enough time.Where is that coming from?\"\n\"I don't think it's anybody's fault: it's the financial pressures, economic pressures and environmental pressures,\" says Grant. \"Life has just got so much faster, almost exponentially, over the past 20 years and convenience has accelerated that. It's created this environment which doesn't enable a family to have the luxury to make time to cook together, but that is so important.\"\nA few weeks ago, after a rough few weeks for my mental health, I popped to a friend's house for dinner. We stood in his kitchen dicing peppers, celery and onions that would make up the bastardised jambalaya I've been cooking for years. As I browned the chicken and he measured out the rice, we talked and soon the pressure that I'd felt building in my life began to ease. And when we sat down to eat, the results of the intimacy I had felt as we cooked tasted good.",

      "content": "Inspired by 'Hot Girls for Bernie', a grassroots campaign is rallying behind the democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani\n\"Hot girls\" may not be a pollster-approved voting bloc in the way that young men or the college-educated are, but since the 2020 election the demographic has held a particular status - at least for the very online.\nIt started in 2020, when the model Emily Ratajkowski officially endorsed Bernie Sanders's pre-pandemic presidential campaign. Inspired by Ratajkowski, self-professed hot girls piled on their endorsements, posting selfies with the hashtag #HotGirlsForBernie. Some saw it as a way to counter the persistent \"Bernie bro\" narrative, a rebuke of the idea that Sanders's fandom consisted solely of obnoxious, socialist-in-name-only men who lived their lives on Twitter.\nFive years later, \"Hot Girls for Bernie\" is a relic, one of the last gasps of hope young progressives felt before the reality of Trump 2.0 took hold. Nevertheless the phrase has returned, this time in support of Zohran Mamdani, the 33-year-old democratic socialist and state assemblyman from Queens who is running for New York City mayor. This week, a social media account called \"Hot Girls 4 Zohran\" dropped on X and Instagram to give away free Mamdani swag.\nThough the account is unaffiliated with the Mamdani's official campaign (and Mamdani's representative declined to comment), it speaks to the grassroots enthusiasm fueling the millennial's run for office.\nMamdani does not have the widespread name recognition of contenders such as the current mayor, Eric Adams, who is running as an independent after a series of scandals, or Andrew Cuomo, who resigned as governor of New York in 2021 after facing multiple sexual harassment accusations, which he denied. But Mamdani's campaign has tapped a hyper-progressive wellspring by putting forth policies that sound ripe for a Fox News scare segment. They include increasing the city's minimum wage from $16.50 to $30, opening city-owned grocery stores, and making childcare and bus fares free.\nMamdani, a failed rapper and son of the indie filmmaker Mira Nair, is most at home on social media, especially TikTok. He exudes a kind of nerdy-cool vibe, which has earned him a GQ profile and a spread in Interview Magazine, where he fielded questions from New York luminaries such as Chloe Sevigny, Cynthia Nixon, Eileen Myles and Julio Torres. Last month, more than 18,000 citywide donors helped his campaign secure $8m, hitting the fundraising limit set by the city.\nHot Girls 4 Zohran is run by two friends, Cait, 24, and Kaif, 28, who live in Brooklyn and did not want their last names published due to privacy concerns. Cait, who is very active on X, says she has been harassed by users who don't agree with her political opinions. But she's fine with her face being out there - she posed for the account next to a box of Hot Girls 4 Zohran T-shirts.\nCait and Kaif say they are supporting Mamdani because he wants to make the city more affordable for the working class and courts individual donors over the super-rich. \"We're both fairly skeptical of institutional politicians, especially given the last election,\" said Cait, who works in marketing. \"We really just want to get his name out there.\"\nAnd hot girls help. Not in an ogling way, but as a tongue-in-cheek way for voters to self-identify and convince others to do so too. \"It's empowering for women, and it brings us together,\" Cait said. \"There's an intersectionality to it.\" Kaif says that they use the \"girl\" descriptor liberally - it's more of a mindset than a gender classification. \"So many men have also reached out to us asking for T-shirts,\" he said.\nAhh look at all those \"\"\"BernieBros\"\"\"... Knocking doors on this cold Chicago evening ;) #HotGirlsForBernie #BernieBros pic.twitter.com/BkRIBkoEKd\nCait was in high school when Hot Girls for Bernie went viral. \"I was still pretty young, but I noticed it even back then,\" she said.\nShe has Danaka Katovich to thank for the inspiration. In 2020, after seeing playful memes about Ratajkowski's support for Sanders, the then student at DePaul University in Chicago made a group chat for \"hot girl\" Bernie supporters. Katovich told Vox that 50 friends joined the group, which dropped a social media campaign featuring equally sexy and silly selfies.\n\"I'm surprised people are still doing this,\" said Katovich, who is now 25 and working for a feminist non-profit aimed at ending US warfare and imperialism. \"Back then, journalists asked me: 'What does Hot Girls for Bernie mean to you?' I was 20 - it didn't mean anything to me, since it started as a joke.\"\nKatovich remembers people criticizing the \"hot girls\" label for being glib or exclusionary, but she insists it was inclusive. \"Anyone could post a picture, non-binary people were included,\" she said. \"Sure, there were some dudes who would comment on a picture and say, 'You're actually more of a seven,' but at the time, it didn't feel like anyone who mattered really cared what you looked like at all.\"\nKari Winter, a professor in the global gender and sexuality studies department at the University at Buffalo, agreed that \"hot girls\" can mean whatever posters want. \"Although I personally would not use the term 'hot' or 'girl' as a trend, I like the way young women, LGBT, non-binary and disabled people use it to claim their own multi-faceted existence in the world,\" she said. \"It reminds me of a time when a lot of us had bumper stickers and T-shirts that said, 'This is what a feminist looks like,' and the point was to be inclusive, because feminists look like everything and anything.\"\nA recent AARP New York and Siena College poll shows that Cuomo holds a strong lead of 34% in the Democratic primary pack, thanks to older voters. Mamdani follows at 16%, and 20% of Democratic voters say they are undecided among the nine total candidates. The June primary is ranked-choice voting, a confusing system that has New Yorkers listing candidates in order of preference. The winner will probably face off against Adams and a Republican in November.\nDespite Cuomo's early lead, Winter says that Mamdani's intense focus on courting working-class voters can serve as a lesson to Democrats. \"Democrats need to understand that the way to energize people is not to keep trying to play to some mythical middle, but to galvanize people who are so sick of corruption and the pandering to wealth,\" she said. \"The only way forward is to galvanize people who care about common people and the common good.\"\nThe Democratic national convention might not recognize a hot girl delegation, but Bernie evangelists say the movement wasn't all frivolous. Hadiya Afzal, a former DePaul University student who was active in the Sanders group chat, says that many of her friends went on to work in progressive politics and still dedicate much of their time to the causes they care about.\n\"I think that's what folks should take away from this kind of campaign: at the end of the day, it's about the policies,\" Afzal said. \"There would have been no Hot Girls for Bernie without an actual policy platform. That's the backbone of what made it meaningful.\"\nOver at Hot Girls 4 Zohran, Cait and Kaif want people do more with the T-shirts than pose in them for social media. \"If you wear the shirt out and about, then it spreads the word, and we really want to mobilize voters of all ages,\" Kaif said. Ultimately, he and Cait hope the moniker will aid the candidate in his goal of building \"the single largest volunteer operation\" of any New York mayoral race ever. With a force of 10,000 door knockers, Mamdani is well on his way.\nOne of those volunteers is Joshua Leirer, a 37-year-old who lives in Ridgewood, Queens. When Leirer canvassed in one of Brooklyn's parks in March, there were so many volunteers that they had to spread into the \"outskirts\". And, crucially, \"the volunteers are hot.\"\n\"The people I talked to were really cool and friendly,\" Leirer said. \"A lot of glasses, a lot of beanies. I would call it a Brooklyn hot.\"",
      "ml_hf_summary": "Zohran Mamdani, a democratic socialist running for New York City mayor, is benefiting from a resurgence of the \"Hot Girls for Bernie\" campaign.  This grassroots movement, inspired by Emily Ratajkowski's endorsement of Bernie Sanders in 2020, uses social media to promote Mamdani and his progressive policies. The campaign features a new account, \"Hot Girls 4 Zohran,\" which distributes free T-shirts and encourages voter mobilization. While Cuomo currently holds a strong lead in the Democratic primary, Mamdani's focus on working-class voters is seen as a potential lesson for Democrats.  The campaign has attracted thousands of volunteers who are actively canvassing neighborhoods across the city. \n"

This is the reality I have lived,\" Abbas said in a statement. \"This is just a glimpse of the dark days that have turned my life into a nightmare.\"\nLast year, the 16-year-old and an accompanying guardian, her adult sister Ashjan who is not injured, evacuated to Egypt, where they spent several months aboard a medical ship. The journey to fit Abbas with a prosthetic arm began with a 24-hour-flight from Cairo to New York, where volunteers met them in the airport during a several-hour layover. \"The only time there was uncertainty was in the visa process,\" said Raghed Ahmed, vice-president of the Philadelphia chapter of the Palestine Children's Relief Fund (PCRF), a non-profit that has provided medical care to Middle Eastern kids since the 1990s. The group also facilitated the sisters' travel. \"We weren't sure if it would take two weeks or six months, but her visa was approved in a couple of weeks,\" Ahmed said.\nSo when Abbas entered the arrivals section at the Philadelphia international airport last December, the mood was ebullient. Some 100 community members cheered and waved Palestinian flags, while others held handmade signs that read \"Welcome to Philadelphia\" in English and Arabic. \"Free Palestine!\" they shouted in unison. Farha Ghannam, an anthropology professor at Swarthmore College and Abbas's host mother, embraced the 16-year-old and handed her a bouquet of flowers as they met for the first time.\n\"When they saw that there was a really big presence from the community at the airport, they really appreciated that. And [Abbas] said it made them forget the tiredness of travel,\" said Johara Shamaa, a volunteer coordinator for PCRF's Philadelphia chapter. Abbas, who declined to be interviewed due to stress, is the only Palestinian child being hosted and medically treated in Philadelphia at the sponsorship of PCRF. Aside from Philadelphia, PCRF has brought more than 20 children to Chicago, Illinois; Washington DC; Portland, Oregon; Houston, Texas; Greenville, South Carolina; St Louis, Missouri; Lexington, Kentucky; Boston, Massachusetts; and Sacramento and Los Angeles, California, to seek medical treatment since October 2023.\nEverywhere the children are sent, a community of people rally behind them to improve their lives. All the while, they perform a delicate dance of navigating an ever-changing evacuation system in the absence of a permanent ceasefire. In Philadelphia, 50 volunteers pitch in by driving Abbas to doctors' appointments, tutoring her in English, and hosting dinners at their homes during the sisters' six-month stay. The cost of Abbas's prosthetic limb and the medical treatment to repair her residual appendage, which was improperly amputated due to the lack of medical resources in Gaza, are being covered by the hospital Shriners Children's Philadelphia.\nThough Abbas's is a story of triumph, thousands of children from Gaza have inadequate or no access to medical treatment. And with Abbas and her sister's visa renewal coming up in May, their futures are uncertain.\n\"You have to constantly be amendable, because every single day something is always changing,\" said Tareq Hailat, head of PCRF's treatment abroad program, which works with government entities and hospitals to facilitate free medical care. \"There's always some kind of difficulty occurring: abandonment of ceasefires, the targeting of humanitarian workers, a new border or corridor coming up, which puts a hold on operations.\"\nWhile the volunteers are helping shape Abbas's life, her host family said that the girls' presence has also helped them feel empowered as they watch from afar Israel's war on Gaza, where more than 62,000 Palestinians have been killed since 7 October 2023.\nWhen PCRF approached them in the late fall of 2024, Ghannam, a Palestinian American, and her husband, Hans Lofgren, a Swedish American who is fluent in Arabic, were eager to host Abbas and her sister at their home in Swarthmore, a quiet suburb 20 miles (32km) south-west of Philadelphia. Being host parents gave them a concrete way to help Palestinians after seeing \"unimaginable suffering\" while watching the news, Lofgren said: \"When you get that kind of a request, you cannot in good conscience say no. It's absolutely a necessity to say yes. You do not know exactly what this would involve, and what would happen, it's a bit of an unknown. But to jump into this was absolutely necessary.\"\nThe complicated process of sending a child to the US from Gaza involves clearances from several governments and the financial backing of non-governmental organizations and hospital systems. It begins when a hospital in the Middle East contacts PCRF because they are unable to address a child's medical needs. PCRF then lines up a hospital abroad that will treat the child for free, and seeks approval to pull the child out of Gaza from the Israeli ministry of defense's coordinator of government activities in the territories, and the Egyptian government. They coordinate with the United Nation's World Health Organization to transport the child through Gaza's Rafah border crossing to a buffer zone in al-Arish, Egypt, and then their visas are secured at embassies in Egypt.\nPCRF then creates a shortlist of families from a large database of volunteers whose culture and language typically align with those of the child, said Hailat from PCRF. Then a member of Hailat's team and the local chapter interview the families and visit their homes before making the final selection. PCRF pays for the children's travel and any clothes or supplies they will need during their six-month stay abroad.\nOutside the US, they've sent more than 250 children to Egypt, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Spain, Italy, Belgium, Germany, Norway, Lebanon and Jordan, and they hope to expand their efforts to the United Kingdom, Australia and Canada. But Hailat said that the amount of children they've helped is only a drop in the bucket.\nWhen Gaza's Rafah border crossing to Egypt closed in May 2024 and children were instead transported through the Israeli-controlled Kerem Shalom crossing, the number of evacuated children dropped from more than 280 children a month to 20. Since the Rafah border crossing was reopened in February, Hailat said, at least 600 people a month have been evacuated from Gaza. But he fears that the amount of evacuees may severely dwindle again following Israel's new security corridor that blocks Rafah from the rest of Gaza.\n\"The biggest problem is that we as an organization are caught in the middle,\" Hailat said. \"We don't want to be a part of the proposed displacement of these children, but we don't want them to die. The only solution is a complete ceasefire that allows us to bring medical treatment inside Gaza.\"\nDespite the frustration in the international process that hinders more children from evacuating, he said his faith resides in the compassionate communities throughout the US that have opened their arms to the children in need of medical treatment. \"One of the most beautiful things about these communities is that they are not just Arabs, they are not just Muslims, they are not just Palestinians. They are Americans. They are of all races, of all religions, of all sexes,\" Hailat said. \"No matter where you stand on the political aisle, once they see these children in real life, people realize that this is a humanitarian issue.\"\nAs a Palestinian American, Ghannam said, she was initially concerned that she might be overwhelmed by the sisters' trauma. But over the past few months, she and Lofgren say, the sisters have brought a brightness to their home. \"I think I'm able to support them, but I think they are also able to support me,\" Ghannam said. \"Just seeing sometimes their spirits and their resilience has actually been very, very important to me. They also have been helping me deal with what's happening.\"\nThe couple only had about a week to prepare for the sisters' arrival after completing a vetting process with PCRF. As a semi-retired economist, Lofgren was in charge of moving the furniture into the 60-somethings' spare storage room and securing two mattresses for the sisters to sleep on. Neighbors and friends gifted the sisters gloves and gift cards to a beauty supply chain. Philadelphia's PCRF chapter created a group chat on WhatsApp to collect winter clothes, hygiene items, books and phone chargers, and community members stepped up to host dinners for the sisters at their homes.\nVolunteers also drive Abbas to her appointments at Shriners hospital, where she's undergoing occupational therapy and being fitted for her prosthesis. Her medical team is determining whether they need to make adjustments to the arm replacement. \"It's a lot more complicated because of the dire need of medical supplies in Gaza, especially with the ongoing genocide and the lack of aid and completely destroyed healthcare systems. The amputation wasn't done as it should have been,\" said Shamaa, of PCRF. As part of her sessions, Abbas is training her left arm to write and do other tasks since she is right-handed. When the prosthetic arm is attached, further occupational therapy sessions will teach Abbas how to use it.\nPCRF will likely try to renew Abbas's visa in May for another six months since she is still undergoing medical care, said Hailat. She and her sister will return to Egypt and live independently through help from PCRF and donations from the community when her treatment ends.\nEarlier this year, volunteer tutors who are bilingual in Arab and English began teaching Abbas English as a second language. They are also tutoring her in math and science using a Palestinian curriculum for the 10th grade, the last grade she completed prior to evacuating Gaza.\nSupporting Abbas requires a delicate balance of helping her feel welcome while giving her the space to process the trauma of evacuating from a war zone and leaving behind most of her family in Gaza, said Ghannam. The couple's home has seen a complicated range of emotions with the backdrop of Israel's war on Gaza. When the ceasefire was announced in mid-January, the sisters were thrilled and exclaimed how enthusiastic they were to eventually return home and for Gaza to be rebuilt. \"I am very cautious and pessimistic, and they managed to engulf me with their optimism,\" Ghannam said. A few hours later, Abbas became solemn when she learned that more than 80 people had been killed in airstrikes directly following the ceasefire announcement.\nStill, Ghannam said, she is impressed by Abbas's strength and wonder as she adjusts to life in the US. During the evenings, the family often watch Arabic shows on Netflix together, or take turns choosing their favorite Arabic songs on YouTube. When Abbas saw snow falling outside the window for the first time during the winter, a big smile stretched across her face as she remarked on its beauty. She went outside to touch it and posed for photos with her sister.\n\"When I see them laugh,\" Ghannam said, \"and when I see them excited about life, that really gives me a good feeling.\"",

      "content": "Mary Annette Pember's expansive and shocking book Medicine River looks at the many ways that the US has tried to dehumanise and eradicate Native families\nMary Annette Pember will publish her first book, Medicine River, on Tuesday. She signed to write it in 2022 but feels she really started work more than 50 years ago, \"before I could even write, when I was under the table as a kid, making these symbols that were sort of my own\".\nA citizen of the Red Cliff Band of Wisconsin Ojibwe, Pember is a national correspondent for ICT News, formerly Indian Country Today. In Medicine River, she tells two stories: of the Indian boarding schools, which operated in the US between the 1860s and the 1960s, and of her mother, her time in such a school and the toll it took.\n\"My mother kind of put me on this quest from my earliest memory,\" Pember said. \"I've always known I would somehow tell her story.\"\nMore than 400 Indian boarding schools operated on US soil. Vehicles for policies of assimilation, perhaps better described as cultural annihilation, the schools were brutal by design. Children were not allowed to speak their own language or practice religions and traditions. Discipline was harsh, comforts scarce. As described by Richard Henry Pratt, an army officer and champion of the project, the aim was to \"kill the Indian in him, and save the man\".\nIn the 1930s, Pember's mother, Bernice Rabideaux, was sent with her siblings to St Mary's Catholic Indian boarding school, on the Ojibwe reservation in Odanah, Wisconsin. Bernice was marked for life. On the page, Pember describes how as a young child she responded to her mother's dark moods by hiding under the kitchen table, making her symbols on its underside. But she also writes about how her mother's \"terrible stories\" about the \"Sisters School\", about psychological and physical abuse, helped form a bond that never broke.\nPember kept writing. A troubled child, she \"sharpened a lead pencil into a dagger-like point and wrote microscopic messages and insults to my family on the wall next to the stairs\" of the family home in Chicago. Later, she became a reporter.\n\"Writing is so visceral for me,\" she said. \"I still like writing with a really sharp pencil, I like the sound of it in my notebooks, and I keep them with me all the time. It always hits me when I'm really tired, and the last thing I want to do is write things down, and that's when I have to do it ... It's just such a part of me, I don't question it.\n\"There was a lot of drama in my house. All these things were going on. Of course, they weren't explained to me. They would sort of lower their voices if they knew I was around. And I just hated being an outsider. I wanted to know what was going on.\"\nMedicine River is an attempt to explain. To most, its story will be unfamiliar. If recent years have seen a shift in US awareness of the boarding schools and their legacy, that is in large part due to events in Canada, where discoveries of unmarked graves at sites of such institutions prompted a national reckoning of sorts.\n\"We were the model from which Canada drew,\" Pember said. \"We predated them by quite some time, and we had far more schools. It had an impact on a far greater number of children. But for some reason we just remain stubbornly ignorant of it here in the United States. They were horrible places in which children were brutalized. And of course it wasn't just the schools. The schools were part of a greater federal assimilationist agenda.\n\"If they had just done the schools to us, it would not have been so bad. But I always think of it as this triple whammy that happened to Native people in the 19th century. It was removal [forced relocation west], then allotment [dividing lands collectively held], then taking the kids away. It was a concerted attack on our culture, our language and our holdings. That was what it was really about. They wanted our land.\n\"The public was averse to outright extermination, so it was framed as a humanitarian policy. I think it is really important to view boarding schools in that context.\"\nPember's investigations led her to dark places. Noting that in other spheres the Catholic church has been forced to reckon with sexual abuse by priests, she said a moment of truth regarding Native boarding schools may yet come - while pointing to milestones already passed including reporting by Dana Hedgpeth and others for the Washington Post, a class action lawsuit in western states, and similar events in Alaska.\n\"Native people were not really viewed as actually human,\" Pember said. \"One of the surprising things I learned in researching the book, was the power of the eugenics movement. I mean, this was not peripheral hogwash. They were teaching this at Harvard. The leaders of the era ... supported this whole notion of eugenics. They were using phrases like 'the final solution'. They stopped short of advocating euthanasia but there were 30 states that allowed involuntary sterilization of people who were considered feeble-minded or in some way racially inferior ... I had not realized how foundational that was, to the way the relationship between the federal government and Native people evolved.\"\nFor Pember, publication day will not be without a certain irony. As Medicine River was written, the federal government finally engaged, to some extent, with the Indian boarding schools and their lasting harms. Last year brought an investigative report, identifying at least 973 student deaths (the Post found more than 3,100), and a presidential apology, delivered by Joe Biden alongside Deb Haaland, the first indigenous secretary of the interior. But as Medicine River comes out, Donald Trump is back, assaulting federal agencies with staffing and budget cuts, seeking to obliterate recognition of America's racist past.\nSign up to First Thing\nOur US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what's happening and why it matters\nafter newsletter promotion\n\"Things are so wild and uncertain,\" Pember said. \"We're all just being pulled back and forth, every single day.\n\"We're still trying to figure out the impact of these things [Trump has] done, because Indian country runs on all of these disparate grants from agencies ... the US Department of Agriculture gives so many grants to Indian country, for example, and then there's various sub-agencies and organizations within that. Unlike mainstream America, we have no tax base, and so we don't really have good, sustainable infrastructure. So we're trying to piece it together.\n\"I[n] the Bad River tribe, where my mom is from, the librarian is gone now. She lost her funding, under some real obscure agency. And that was so sad. They just recently got it, and they were really feeling they were sitting pretty, and now that's gone.\"\nHope remains. The Truth and Healing Commission on Indian Boarding School Policies in the United States Act, a bipartisan measure introduced in 2021, is not dead yet. Lisa Murkowski, an Alaska Republican senator more independent-minded than most, has taken it up. Pember noted that if such a commission is formed, it will not have subpoena power, perhaps necessary for co-operation from the Catholic church.\nPember is determined to keep the Indian boarding schools in the public eye.\n\"The goal is to record as much as possible the stories that people have,\" she said. \"To say, 'Yes, this happened to you. Let's document this.'\"\nDescribing research at Marquette University in Milwaukee, in the archives of the Bureau of Catholic Indian Missions, she said: \"The big thing is to make these records available to people. I can tell you how powerful it is just see your relative's name printed. To see my mom's name and my uncles and aunts and my grandmother and grandfather, to see their names on these rosters ... was just something really powerful. It said: 'This happened, and there's no workaround. There's no way people can apologize it away. This did happen.' That's uniquely powerful.\"\nMedicine River is out in the US on 22 April",
      "ml_hf_summary": "Mary Annette Pember's book \"Medicine River\" explores the history of Indian boarding schools in the United States, which operated from the 1860s to the 1960s. The book details her mother's experience at a Catholic school and the lasting impact of this assimilationist policy on Native American communities. Pember highlights the brutal conditions of these institutions, including forced language suppression and physical abuse, with the aim of erasing Indigenous cultures.  The book also examines the broader context of federal policies aimed at removing Native Americans from their lands and assimilating them into mainstream society. Despite recent efforts by the Biden administration to acknowledge the harm caused by boarding schools, Pember's work highlights ongoing challenges faced by Native communities due to political instability and limited resources. The book is set for release on April 22nd in the US.  \n"

      "content": "Ever since the artist's repellent crimes were brought to light, the world has grappled with how to treat his work. Now a new exhibition at Ditchling, where he lived, is giving survivors a say\nA young girl kneels on her bedroom floor, hands pressed together, as another figure towers over her, one arm raised. This watercolour, made by Eric Gill, is titled Annunciation - but for the abuse survivors currently working on a show of his work that will open in the town where he lived, this scene is far from holy. For them, it is loaded with disturbing overtones.\n\"What I see isn't the Virgin Mary and the Angel Gabriel. It's a scared little girl in a room where she ought to feel safe, with a terrifying figure looming over her, blocking the exit,\" says Vivien Almond, one of the survivors involved in the project. \"There's no way out - even the window behind her is tiny.\" The image, says Almond, is \"all about power - the power that figure has over that young girl invading her space, threatening her. And that's what Eric Gill was all about.\"\nAlmond knows what she's talking about: as a child, she was sexually abused by her own father over many years, just as Gill's two elder daughters Betty and Petra were - a fact that didn't come to light until a biography by Fiona MacCarthy was published in 1989, the author having found evidence of the crimes in Gill's own previously unseen diaries.\nSince then the world has grappled with how to treat the artist's work. Some galleries have quietly removed it from view. Last week, one of his most famous pieces, a sculpture of Prospero and Ariel from Shakespeare's The Tempest, was returned to public view at BBC Broadcasting House in London, albeit behind a protective screen, following an incident in which it was damaged. A QR code nearby now links to details of Gill's crimes.\nThe BBC said it had taken \"expert advice\", although it isn't clear if that was from survivors. This new show is believed to be the first time survivors of abuse have been directly involved in deciding whether and what to show of Gill's work and how to interpret it. It is being put together at Ditchling Museum of Art + Craft, the institution most strongly associated with his story. The museum is in the Sussex village that was home for six years to Gill and the artistic community he founded, which continued to be based there after he and his family moved to Wales in the 1920s.\nSince Gill's crimes became known, the museum, says its director Steph Fuller, has never sought to hide from the reprehensible elements of his story. A statement on its website condemns his abuse, but adds that his \"importance to art and design history in the UK and across the world is impossible to ignore\".\nYet Fuller thinks more needs to be said. \"I've felt for a while,\" she says, \"that the voices missing in our interpretation are the voices of the daughters who were subjected to the abuse.\" Those daughters are now dead, but one day two years ago, Fuller found herself talking to Ann Sumner, chair of the Methodist Modern Art Collection (MMAC) in London. Sumner was wondering what to do with a Gill painting owned by the MMAC. From that conversation grew the idea of a new exhibition, which will lead in time to a re-imagining of the Ditchling collection overall, curated with four abuse survivors, members of the Methodist Survivors Advisory Group.\nOne thing the survivors were clear about, says Fuller, was the importance of showing Gill's work and not sweeping it under the carpet. \"They said hiding things and not talking about them is the culture in which abuse flourishes. There are lots of very difficult and emotive issues to discuss here. But if the survivors can do it, then the rest of us certainly can.\"\nAlmond adds: \"If you don't show his work, you're not telling the story of this man. My view is it needs to be seen, but included alongside it needs to be the story of what this man did, how he abused his daughters. It's been said what he did didn't affect these women much. But that's rubbish. If you suffer abuse, it stays with you, it's a pain you never get rid of, and it changes everything else that happens to you.\"\nThe new display will be part of an exhibition at Ditchling entitled It Takes a Village, to open in early July. It will include both Annunciation, the work that so struck Almond, and other pieces including Gill drawings of Betty and Petra, among them a nude of Betty when she was 16. \"That was drawn at the point when the abuse was happening,\" says Fuller.\nFiona, another survivor involved in the Ditchling project, says she's been surprised by how little museums and art galleries have consulted survivors when making decisions around Gill's work. \"Art has a tendency to be self-congratulatory and pretentious. Art historians think they know things, but actually all they know about is art. They don't know what it's like to survive abuse.\"\nOne issue for her is monetary value. \"When someone is a name, their work is worth more. It's to do with someone's reputation, but it shouldn't be only their artistic reputation - because with Gill you've got someone who was much revered, but we now know he was a very unpleasant character: sleazy, a paedophile. So his value should reflect that reputation as well.\"\nFiona testified against her abuser, a man who lodged in her family home when she was a child, decades after his crimes took place, and he was convicted and imprisoned. \"I wanted to hold him to account, and I want to hold Gill to account. He was a smug and arrogant man and in writing about his abuse in his diaries, I think perhaps he wanted it all to come out eventually - he wanted the world to see how clever he'd been, hiding it all from everyone, making people think he was so saintly.\"\nNow in her 70s, Fiona says the attitude to abuse has changed for survivors over the years. \"It used to be hushed up, and people would say it doesn't do any real harm. But now it's being more talked about that view has changed - so getting more people to speak about it is the way forward.\"\nChildhood books made by the Gill daughters and the 1922 sculpture Divine Lovers (Icon) - showing Christ embracing a figure representing the church - will also be included in the display, which will be in a separate room at the museum. \"We're very mindful of visitors who might have been victims of abuse,\" says Fuller. \"There will be a notice explaining the content before people go into the room.\"\nSurvivors' sensitivities have tended to be more around works that home in on intimate situations in the home, rather than with pieces that are sexually explicit, says Fuller. \"We've been talking a lot about abuse holistically, how it happens and the family dynamics around it. Also, because the survivors are from a Christian group, and Gill was a Catholic, they've been interested in how he depicted spiritual and divine subjects in a sexualised way.\"\n It Takes a Village is at Ditchling Museum of Art + Craft, East Sussex, in July.\n In the UK, Rape Crisis offers support for rape and sexual abuse on 0808 802 9999 in England and Wales, 0808 801 0302 in Scotland, or 0800 0246 991 in Northern Ireland. In the US, Rainn offers support on 800-656-4673. In Australia, support is available at 1800Respect (1800 737 732). Other international helplines can be found at ibiblio.org/rcip/internl.html",
      "ml_hf_summary": "A new exhibition at Ditchling Museum of Art + Craft in England will feature Eric Gill's artwork, but with a focus on survivor perspectives and the impact of his abuse. The exhibition, \"It Takes a Village,\" is curated by survivors who were abused by Gill, including Fiona MacCarthy, whose biography revealed his crimes.  The museum acknowledges Gill's artistic legacy while also highlighting the victims' experiences. Survivors will be involved in curating the exhibit, which includes works like \"Annunciation\" and pieces depicting Gill's daughters, alongside sculptures of religious figures. The exhibition aims to provide a more complete picture of Gill's life and work, including his abuse of his daughters.  The museum is also sensitive to visitors who may have experienced abuse and will provide information about the content before entering the room featuring works that depict intimate situations. \n"

      "content": "The star's new single, Azizam, is a rare pop-cultural moment in which Iran is celebrated for the beauty of its culture\nAs a second-generation Persian immigrant, my connection with my roots has always been relatively surface-level. Admiring the intricate artworks adorning the walls of our homes, hand-loomed rugs crafted by my own grandmother, barberry-laden rice and saffron-infused stews, the music of Googoosh, Bijan Mortazavi and Susan Roshan blasting from dawn to dusk.\nMy parents spoke Farsi to one another and to me when I was a child and as such it was my mother tongue. But I was born in Australia, so it was only going to be a matter of time before I became more proficient in English. Now I stumble my way through conversations in broken Farsi, longing for the day when Iran will be safe enough to finally visit and I can hopefully scrub up my language skills.\nMy parents have never returned to Iran. Not since they left at the beginning of the Islamic Revolution in 1979 due to their belief in the Baha'i faith - a religion promoting the unity of mankind whose adherents have been persecuted in Iran since its inception in the mid 19th century. The closest my mother has ever been to her homeland was last year, when we stopped over in Qatar on our way to France.\nIran has had a bad rap over the years; many in the west associate it with terrorism, religious extremism and crimes against humanity. And for good reason. It's constantly under scrutiny for its oppression of women and other minority groups, and its identity is framed by the media's negative portrayal of the country, its people and regime.\nAnd then, a white man sings.\nEd Sheeran has released a new single titled Azizam, which translates to \"my dear\" or \"my love\" in Farsi - and the diaspora is going wild. The song was written and produced alongside Iranian-born Swedish songwriter Ilya Salmanzadeh. While the melody is all western pop, the Middle Eastern influences are clear, with instruments including the daf and santoor making a welcome appearance.\nSign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning\nMy own children, who are Persian-Canadian and born in Australia, have always grappled with their cultural identity. When they heard Sheeran's new song, they were euphoric. Here was a piece of music that was crossing cultural boundaries, allowing them to piece together who they were - albeit superficially. A white person, like them, singing in Farsi, also like them!\nRecently, Persian comedian Maz Jobrani posted a short explainer on his Instagram about why Persians are so excited about the new song, saying: \"Ever since we came to the west, we've been getting negative press. From the hostage crisis, to the movie Not Without My Daughter ... so anytime anyone in the west does anything remotely good about us, we get excited!\" For so long, Iran has been regarded as just a country in peril. With Sheeran's new song, the western world can now catch a glimpse of the beauty, excitement and life that has been harboured within the country - if only it had the freedom to share it more liberally.\nFor my entire life, my parents made sure I knew that Iran was a country with potential. Over thousands of years, since ancient Persian civilisation, our culture has influenced fashion, architecture and language. The contributions it has made to art, music, faith and science are some of the most profound the world has ever known. We want the beauty of our culture to define us. The fact that Iran continues to commit the most cruel and intense human rights crimes is a cause for lament both in the country and beyond.\nAzizam was inspired by Sheeran's wife, but it's much more than a love song. It's a showcase of the beauty inherent in Iran, and a reconceptualisation of its identity. To those who emigrated or fled, it is an ode to their own homeland; it evokes a yearning to reunite with their beloved. To those in the broader diaspora, it's a connection with their heritage. When Sheeran releases the entire song in Farsi, I can just imagine the weddings, celebrations and mehmoonis (Persian gatherings) blasting the song from dawn to dusk; the chant becoming a rally cry reminiscent of the glory days - albeit in broken Farsi.",
      "ml_hf_summary": "Ed Sheeran's new single \"Azizam\" is generating significant excitement within the Iranian diaspora. The song, written with an Iranian-born songwriter and featuring Middle Eastern musical influences, translates to \"my dear\" or \"my love\" in Farsi.  The song has resonated deeply with Persian communities worldwide, offering a glimpse into the beauty and cultural richness of Iran despite its ongoing struggles with human rights issues. Sheeran's song is seen as a positive representation of Iranian culture and a symbol of hope for those who have left their homeland due to persecution or political turmoil. The song's popularity has sparked discussions about reconceptualizing Iran's identity and celebrating its rich history and contributions to the world. \n"

      "content": "While generation Z are making gains at the gym, are they losing out on connection?\nGym membership in the UK is more popular than ever - and generation Z are a key demographic boosting the numbers. Gen Z are also drinking less than previous generations. So why are gen Z choosing working out over hanging out at the pub?\n\"I see on social media, people saying, if you do this, and you do this, and you do this, then you'll feel better, and then you'll look better,\" Isabel Brooks, a freelance reporter and \"zillennial\", tells Helen Pidd.\n\"It's framed as this mental health advice, but it feels like it all boils down to being a kind of the best version of yourself, and that feels inherently capitalist, inherently individualistic.\"\nBut don't they want to see friends at a pub or a club?\n\"It's expensive,\" Isabel says. \"I mean, my gym subscription is PS28, and I can drop that in a flash on a birthday pub event at a London pub, especially where the pints are like almost PS7.\"\nHelen also visits charity worker Niyi Akinseye at a gym in central London, where he works out for four hours a day. He's made friends at the gym, but wishes that their generation were more connected.\n\"I often reflect that I see people in the gym more than I see my mum or any family member, but you don't say hello to them. You just walk past them awkwardly. And I think that's what I've really encouraged myself to break down, to do, to actually get to know the people you see every day.\n\"History is one of my passions outside of fitness. One of my favourite periods of time is, for example, the French Revolution. And a lot of those ideas were formed by young people going in pubs and discussing ideas. And I think there's definitely something missed by people of our generation not meeting more and actually discussing the real issues that are going on in society right now.\"\nSupport the Guardian today: theguardian.com/todayinfocuspod",
      "ml_hf_summary": "Gym membership is experiencing a surge in popularity among UK Gen Z, contributing to increased participation rates.  This trend coincides with a decline in alcohol consumption among this generation.  Gen Z's preference for fitness over social gatherings at pubs or clubs is attributed to the perceived connection between physical well-being and achieving an idealized self-image.  While some Gen Z individuals find camaraderie at gyms, they also express a desire for deeper connections with others, highlighting a potential disconnect in social interaction.  Niyi Akinseye, a charity worker who prioritizes fitness, observes that despite forming friendships at the gym, there's a lack of genuine interactions between members, emphasizing the need for more meaningful social engagement. \n"

the immediate parent company of Sky News - and the BBC.\nOutside football, he also worked with Premier Rugby, the Six Nations, the NFL on its UK broadcasting deals and the International Olympic Committee in his capacity as chief executive of, and majority shareholder in, Reel Enterprises. \n Money blog: 'I gambled away PS1m, two marriages and tried to take my life but still see ads -

that of the somewhat opportunist targeting of different areas with very different messages.\n\"There is a certain consistency in where we won that helps explain that higher vote retention,\" said Lib Dem president Lord Pack.\n\"Look at leaflets in different constituencies [last year] and they were much more consistent than previous elections... the messages are fundamentally the same in a way that was not always the case in the past.\"\nA bottom-up campaign machine\nNew MPs have also been tasked with demonstrating delivery and focusing doggedly on the issues that matter to their constituents.\nOne Home Counties MP says he wants to be able to send out leaflets by 2027, saying \"everyone in this constituency knows someone who has been helped by their local Lib Dem\".\nIn the run-up to last year's vote, strategists gave the example of the Lib Dem candidate who was invited to a local ribbon-cutting ceremony in place of the sitting Tory MP as proof of how the party can ingratiate itself into communities.\nWith that in mind, the aim for these local elections is to pick up councillors in the places the party now has new MPs, allowing them to dig in further and keep building a bottom-up campaign machine.\nFollow our channel and never miss an update.\n'Anyone but Labour or Conservative'\nBut what of the next general election?\nSenior Lib Dems are confident of holding their current 72 seats.\nThey also point to the fact 20 of their 27 second-place finishes currently have a Conservative MP.\nThose will be the main focus, along with the 43 seats in which they finished third.\nThere's also an acronym brewing to describe the approach -

It's often easy if you read for content -- large language models, or LLMs, are famous for advising you to stick toppings to your pizza with glue, advocating eating rocks and insisting that there are only two Rs in the word \"strawberry\". But is there also something in the style?\nFor the last few months, a theory has been circulating on developer forums that one tell-tale sign is a surfeit of em dashes -- the longest and proudest dash, the length of a lower-case m, rather than the modest en dash, the length of an n, or the puny hyphen. ChatGPT is apparently so addicted to em dashes that some users claim it's impossible to prevent it from -- sprinkling -- them -- through -- all of its output, as if Emily Dickinson herself is breathlessly circulating your quarterly report.\nThe simple way to avoid this, of course, is to write your own emails. But what if you do, and your prose is so banal that someone mistakes it for AI anyway? Mortifying. No doubt many editors, judges and academics have already had the experience of reading a manuscript, court submission or essay and thinking: is this AI, or is the person who wrote it just a bit dense?\nFormer New York governor Andrew Cuomo, now running for mayor, released a housing plan last week that was littered with gibberish. It included such passages as: \"Nevertheless, several candidates for mayor this year have either called directly for a rent increase or for other measures that would tilt the scale toward lower rent increases. This is a politically convenient posture, but to be in. Victory if landlords -- small landlords in particular -- are simply unable to maintain their buildings.\" Two em dashes in there. Most suspicious. Though, even without those, an attentive reader might have noticed a couple of issues.\nA campaign spokesman argued that the plan wasn't generated by an LLM, saying: \"If it was written by ChatGPT, we wouldn't have had the errors.\" How much more embarrassing is it, though, to have typed this guff as a human being? One criticism of AI is that if you can't be bothered to write your own housing plans, no one else should bother to read them. But what if you did write them, and the problem is you're incompetent? That's a real vote-winner.\nSome will argue that writing isn't just the generation of plausible text: it is a process of thinking and analysing. The act of creation is how we challenge and refine our ideas. If you have to work harder to express precisely what you mean, that's wonderful. The labour of writing expands our brains, understanding, imagination and empathy. \nBut this point in history is a terrible time to expand our brains. AI is going to take most of our jobs, and in a few years we'll be serfing it up at the Soylent Green factory. Do you really want to be able to think critically about what you're doing during your 16-hour shift at the mulcher? Upsetting yourself with intrusive thoughts such as \"why have we allowed the world's worst people to destroy everything worth living for?\" and \"did Karl Marx have a point?\" and \"gosh, I hope this stuff really is plankton.\" No, you do not. \nMuch better to reduce your intellectual capacity to that of an obedient drone. A number of studies have already shown that using AI regularly impairs your cognitive function. So by all means keep generating those emails, em dashes and all, and turn your brain into soup. \nThere may be those among us who are not content to accept this future; who still hope and believe that human craft and creativity, even human life, have meaning. Suckers! What has humanity ever done for shareholder value? Still, if you don't want your writing to be confused with AI, it's not really a question of what punctuation you use. Just try to write something worth reading. ",

      "content": "George Steer in New York\nPublishedApril 18 2025\nYour guide to what the 2024 US election means for Washington and the world\nWall Street banks have slashed their targets for the main US share gauge over the past fortnight, as fears grow over the potential economic fallout from President Donald Trump's trade war.\nAt least 10 banks, including JPMorgan, Bank of America and Evercore ISI, have cut their estimates for the S&P 500 index in the weeks since Trump's decision to impose a baseline duty of 10 per cent on most US imports and higher \"reciprocal tariffs\" sent shockwaves through financial markets.\nThe S&P 500 has fallen more than 7 per cent in highly volatile trading since the initial levies were announced on April 2, and 14 per cent since touching a record high on February 19. Trump has since paused the reciprocal tariffs and created a carve-out for smartphones and some other electronics. \nBut economists say the uncertainty caused by rapid U-turns in trade policy could still slow economic growth, or even trigger a recession -- something that would hit the earnings of listed US companies. \n\"The goldilocks sentiment in place entering this year has given way to abject uncertainty,\" said Citigroup analyst Scott Chronert in a note.\nSome content could not load. Check your internet connection or browser settings.\nWall Street's average end of year S&P 500 target now stands at 6,012 -- compared with 6,539 at the end of last year. The S&P 500 finished this week at 5,283. \nThe new forecasts mean that, despite growing worries about slowing economic growth, strategists nevertheless expect the index to rise 14 per cent over the coming months. It would mark a gain of just 2 per cent for 2025, a major slowdown from the back-to-back rallies of more than 20 per cent in 2023 and 2024. \nThe banks' newly cautious tone marks a humbling reversal since the start of the year, when many market participants had expected lower taxes and lighter regulation under a Republican administration to boost corporate profits. \nCitigroup on Friday said it expects the S&P 500 to end the year at 5,800, down from a previous call of 6,500. The bank also lowered its 2025 earnings per share estimate to $255 from $270, just below the average forecast of $262, Bloomberg data shows.\nChronert said the recent sharp fall for US equities may become \"the first bear market specifically triggered by US presidential actions\". \nJPMorgan lowered its \"base case\" target on April 7 to 5,200 from 6,500, assuming \"partial\" relief on tariffs. \"Even though we do not believe US exceptionalism is over,\" the bank wrote at the time, \"this [liberation day] shock came at a time when valuation was rich, positioning was crowded and leadership was particularly narrow.\"\nRecommended\nPeter Berezin at BCA Research, who has the lowest 2025 price target for the S&P 500 among analysts surveyed by Bloomberg, said in mid-February that he expects the index to close out this year at about 4,450, implying a drop of 15 per cent from current levels. In early March he said a US recession was likely to begin within the next three months.\n\"There's a lot of groupthink on Wall Street,\" said Berezin.",
      "ml_hf_summary": "Following President Trump's trade war-related tariffs, major Wall Street banks have significantly lowered their S&amp;P 500 target estimates.  At least ten banks, including JPMorgan and Bank of America, have reduced their end-of-year targets to 6,012 from 6,539 previously, reflecting concerns about the potential economic impact of the tariffs. The S&amp;P 500 has fallen over 7% since Trump's initial tariff announcement on April 2nd and is currently trading at 5,283.  Economists warn that the uncertainty caused by trade policy changes could slow economic growth or even trigger a recession, impacting company earnings. Despite this, Wall Street strategists still expect a 14% rise in the S&amp;P 500 over the coming months, but at a much slower pace than previous years.  \n"

      "content": "Katie Martin \nPublishedApril 18 2025\nRoula Khalaf, Editor of the FT, selects her favourite stories in this weekly newsletter.\nEither the mighty US mom-and-pop investor base knows something we don't, or it's heading for a bruising.\nRight now, the amateurs are sitting pretty. Domestic retail investors were, by all accounts, conspicuously active buyers of US stocks in the initial firestorm kicked off by Donald Trump's so-called \"reciprocal\" tariffs announcement at the start of this month. \nAs stocks indices plunged, purchases from this group were, as Vanda Research puts it, \"historic\". Fair play to them. It was a brave call, but from the very lowest point on April 7, the US S&P 500 is still up by 9 per cent.\nIn recent years, retail punters have been an important market segment for professional investors to watch. They were swift to buy the (much larger) dip after the Covid shock five years ago, jumping in when many institutional investors were still too nervous, and they were absolutely right. It is worth thinking about what drives them. \nLogic dictates that one reason is a large number of have-a-go investors in the US voted for Trump, and quite possibly believe his argument that massive import taxes are poised to rekindle jobs in the country's manufacturing sector.\nSome content could not load. Check your internet connection or browser settings.\nHowever, muscle memory is a powerful thing. The past 65 years tell us that US stocks reliably go up, in roughly twice as many years as they go down. Positive runs are much more powerful and longer lasting than bad patches. \nEven for more heavy-hitting institutional investors, the rationale for buying now, when US stocks are down by some 10 per cent so far this year, is incredibly strong, if we are playing by the usual market rule of zigging when the world zags. (Note the \"if\".)\nThe mood among fund managers is absolutely dire. Bank of America's regular monthly survey of institutional investors, released this week, is pretty apocalyptic -- the fifth most miserable reading in its quarter-century history. Growth expectations are at 30-year lows, with almost half now expecting a hard landing in the US. A record number of respondents intend to cut exposure to US stocks. \nSome content could not load. Check your internet connection or browser settings.\nWhen institutional investors turn that miserable that fast, your inner contrarian would normally tell you to be brave like US retail investors and jump in.\nSome of the woe-is-me wailing at the sky from professional fund managers may also be a little performative. \"Today we're hearing a lot that we'll never go back,\" said Michael Kelly, head of multi-asset at PineBridge Investments. \"But I know finance people, and they'll do whatever makes sense in future. Wall Street people will go where the cheese is.\" \nA hint of the notion that the pain has gone too far is also evident in US government bond markets, typically the territory of the professionals. Treasuries are, in many maturities, strikingly weak, despite the three to four interest rate cuts investors now anticipate for the rest of this year that would normally waft bond prices higher. \nMike Riddell, a bond fund manager at Fidelity International, said he had been running smaller allocations to Treasuries than normal, but \"we have been scaling into it now\", he said, adding that he's \"getting to the point\" where they are cheap enough to pique his interest.\nSo, pack in your caveats as you see fit. On paper, in theory, on average, based on historical precedent and if the usual rules apply, the present moment is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to snaffle up US assets on the cheap.\nAnd yet the rush to do that is just not there. The consensus among the pros is that the tariffs policy itself is a mess. One moment, commerce secretary Howard Lutnick is on US television telling the world about the administration's grand vision of \"millions\" of Americans fixing tiny screws in to iPhones as part of a new golden age for American craftsmanship, and a week later, his boss decides to exempt smartphones from some of the tariffs altogether. In any case, it takes years to bring sophisticated manufacturing back home, and the next US president could scrap the import taxes entirely. In that environment, few sane US company executives would crank up domestic manufacturing as Trump hopes. \nMeanwhile, the president is busily launching blunt broadsides against Federal Reserve chair Jay Powell and, the icing on the cake -- the US's crucial tech sector took a massive hit this week after chips giant Nvidia said it would take a multibillion-dollar earnings hit from new export restrictions to China. The Philadelphia semiconductor index is down by 22 per cent this year.\nUncertainty in markets is nothing new. It is the whole point. It is why certain assets pay out returns to those brave enough to buy them. But it has a whole new flavour now. An orange flavour.\nRecord-breaking gold prices, a soaring Swiss franc and a massive jump in German government bonds are all a clear sign that professional investors are deeply spooked, and anticipating the next wave of pain. If the retail dip buyers are right again, this will have been a heroic call on their part, but the odds are heavily stacked against them. My hunch is that the beatings will continue until morale improves.\nkatie.martin@ft.com",
      "ml_hf_summary": "US retail investors exhibited significant buying activity in US stocks following Donald Trump's tariff announcement, resulting in a 9% increase in the S&P 500 index despite initial market declines. Institutional investors, however, are experiencing pessimism and have reduced their exposure to US stocks, with Bank of America's survey indicating record-low growth expectations and a high number of fund managers anticipating a recession. Despite this negative sentiment, historical data suggests that US stock markets tend towards positive trends over time.  However, the uncertainty surrounding Trump's tariffs policy and its potential impact on manufacturing remains a significant factor in investor decisions. The combination of these factors has created an environment where professional investors are hesitant to invest heavily, while retail investors remain optimistic about potential long-term gains. \n"

The US central bank chair said as much on Wednesday.\nAs CEOs of public companies, we disagree with your trade policies in the strongest possible terms. We hereby promise to do everything in our power to challenge them. Do not doubt our unity and resolve on this issue.\nAnd by the way, the 250 signatories below control two-thirds of public equity markets by value, $25tn in annual revenues and 35mn employees. Our global tax contribution last year exceeded a trillion dollars.\nDid you see this full-page message from the world's top chief executives in the Financial Times yesterday? No, you did not. There wasn't one. Not in this newspaper and not anywhere else, either.\nThe silence of CEOs in the face of Donald Trump's tariff chaos is one of the biggest failures of leadership in corporate history. Where are they when we need them? In the corner shuffling their shoes.\nSome bosses are said to have voiced concerns behind closed doors. Very brave. Others argue that engagement with administration officials behind the scenes is a better approach.\nHow is that going then? Shareholders have already lost trillions. So you're strategically not speaking out lest the White House retaliates? It's like worrying about a punch to the stomach after your throat's been cut.\nA few CEOs have been robust, we are told. JPMorgan's Jamie Dimon says that \"this uncertainty is challenging\". The head of Delta Air Lines called the situation \"self-inflicted\". Healthcare equity could suffer, warned AstraZeneca's chair.\nOh, stop! What became of the \"mega-corps\" -- and those who ran them -- becoming more powerful than nation states? We now know who wears the trousers.\nThe irony is that most of our supine CEOs have been through some sort of leadership training. Almost 40 per cent of S&P 500 bosses have an MBA. Corner suites teem with coaches exhorting them to \"walk the talk\".\nWorldwide there are currently 160 management programmes specialising in leadership. Last year, 7,000 students began a senior leadership masters in the UK alone. And don't forget the shelves of corporate leadership books published every year. Amazon lists more than 30,000, urging CEOs to Start with Why if they want to go from Good to Great. \nLame to average would be nice. \nSo why have global bosses failed to lead when it is clear that every one of their stakeholders will suffer if anything like the tariffs being discussed come to be?\nWe cannot blame the teachers. Harvard University -- home to arguably the top MBA programme on the planet as well as countless leadership courses -- has declared all-out war with Trump this month. That's gutsy. What excuse does its alumni -- from the heads of McDonald's to Citigroup and Novartis -- have?\nPrivately they say the law is the law. Tariffs are implemented under executive authority -- having been delegated by Congress decades ago to combat unfair practices or issues of national security.\nBut unlike other policies, there are few checks and balances with tariffs. Congress can't undo them and there is no need for the administration to demonstrate benefit, let alone defend an economic cost.\nNot much can be done, in other words. But there is nothing to stop chief executives pressuring Congress to revoke executive authority over tariffs. They already sign off $4.5bn annually on US federal lobbying.\nShort of that they could also urge lawmakers to tighten the criteria for imposing tariffs, as suggested by the Brookings Institution, introduce mandatory reporting or strengthen judicial oversight.\nA dozen CEOs demanding these changes would fail. Hundreds or indeed thousands of bosses acting as one -- representing consumers, employees and suppliers -- would be impossible to ignore.\nChairs and boards have to step up. Decades of peace and economic stability have allowed technocrats, operational chiefs and finance-wallahs to rise to the top of business. Many suffer from imposter syndrome for good reason. They must be replaced with true leaders of vision and steel, less skilled at empathy workshops but ruthless when it comes to fighting for what is right -- for shareholders and, frankly, all of us.\nA supine response to tariffs suggests the current lot of CEOs should be fired -- as someone in the White House might say.\nstuart.kirk@ft.com",

He compared the advances to AI surpassing humans at chess several years ago, but argued this had a more democratising impact \"on the world if everybody can create software\".\nLeading industry figures say LLMs have sped up the software development process by generating entire blocks of code based on a few text instructions. AI systems can also identify errors and attempt to correct them.\nOver the past year, AI models have become far more capable of understanding complex patterns, reasoning over problems presented in programming, and solving them logically.\nIn 2023, AI systems were only able to solve 4.4 per cent of coding problems based on an industry test called SWE-bench. This figure jumped to 69.1 per cent this year.\nMeanwhile, research from Microsoft's coding platform GitHub found 92 per cent of US-based developers use AI coding tools.\n\"AI coding is saving thousands of dollars for an engineer,\" said Misha Laskin, co-founder and chief executive of coding start-up Reflection AI. \"For some of these categories, it is able to do it for you on demand with something you might have paid $10,000 for. We're entering an unprecedentedly large market.\"\nStart-ups such as Reflection have attracted strong investor interest, with it raising $130mn to date with funding from Sequoia and Lightspeed. Anysphere, behind coding automation tool Cursor, raised $105mn at a $2.5bn valuation in January.\n\"We are driving the cost down of what it means to do intelligent work, that means we're going to have to rethink what some of our roles are,\" said Eiso Kant, co-founder of Poolside, a start-up that raised $500mn in October at a $3bn valuation from investors including Bain Capital and Nvidia. \nRecommended\nMeta launched a model called Code Llama last year, which uses text prompts to generate and discuss code. Anthropic has its own coding product, Claude Code, which was launched in February.\nMike Krieger, chief product officer at Anthropic, said the software engineer's role would increasingly involve \"understanding the requirements [of users], working as a team, and figuring out that what you built was actually the right thing to build\".\n\"It is more about advocating for your idea or seeing how those things play out [and becoming] almost like a puppet master or an orchestra conductor of these [AI] agents,\" he added.\n\"I don't think coding will disappear at all,\" said Thomas Wolf, co-founder of Hugging Face, an open source AI platform. \"Coders will just use this tool to go faster.\" \nAdditional reporting from George Hammond in San Francisco",
      "ml_hf_summary": "OpenAI released GPT-4.1, o3, and o4-mini models that demonstrate significant improvements in coding problem solving compared to previous versions. These models are being integrated into Codex CLI, an AI \"agent\" designed to assist users with coding tasks.  Leading companies like Anthropic, Google, Meta, and start-ups are also developing AI systems for coding, with research indicating a 69.1% increase in AI's ability to solve coding problems compared to last year. The use of AI in software development is rapidly increasing, with over 92% of US developers using AI coding tools, leading to cost savings and increased efficiency.  The shift towards AI-assisted coding is expected to reshape the role of software engineers, requiring them to focus on understanding user requirements and collaborating with AI agents. \n"

      "content": "Mark Ellwood\nPublishedApril 18 2025\nYour guide to what the 2024 US election means for Washington and the world\nIt had been shaping up to be a strong year for prime real estate in New York City. The market here typically has an annual rhythm, where transactions only truly begin after private schools return from spring break, which means it's often frenzied between April and mid-June. Yet over the past three months, there has been a surge of winter activity: data from top tier real estate firm Corcoran showed closings in that period rose 14 per cent year on year, the largest annual increase in the past three years. What's more, 215 of them were for properties worth more than $5mn, 16 per cent above the five-year average for the first quarter. Knight Frank's latest Wealth Report, published in early March, suggested a market revival in 2025 following a five-year period where prices fell 3.1 per cent; a true market expansion, perhaps, for the first time since 2019.\nIt's perhaps not surprising, given that -- after its pronounced pandemic malaise -- the city seems to be on a high-spending mission to enjoy itself: face value for top-price tickets to see Denzel Washington's middlingly reviewed turn as Othello opposite Jake Gyllenhaal's Iago hit $921, helping it set a record for highest-grossing week for a non-musical in Broadway history after it opened in late March. Private members' clubs are mushrooming, competing for deep-walleted patrons to pay annual dues and fees -- take San Vicente, which opened in the West Village last month as an east coast outpost of the Hollywood favourite, and which charges up to $15,000 in initiation costs and $4,200 in annual fees. French department store Printemps opened a 55,000 sq ft shop at One Wall Street at much the same time, unperturbed at the supposed challenges in that sector. \n\"I've been in New York City for a long time now. Its energy is back: crowded restaurants, busy streets, plenty of traffic,\" says Rebecca Patterson, former chief investment strategist at Bridgewater Associates who's now senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations.\nYet, as Patterson also recognises, the momentum -- in housing and in city life -- might well stall as a result of the presidential policy on tariffs instituted this month. Average rates for a 30-year fixed mortgage, the US default, reached 7.07 per cent on April 11, 47 basis points up from a week earlier, according to Mortgage News Daily, though some experts predicted they could climb higher. \nShe also cites data showing widespread caution around home-buying across the US as a whole; a University of Michigan consumer sentiment survey published on April 11 showed 83 per cent of respondents saying it was a poor time to buy a house. \"The same survey showed consumer inflation expectations for the year ahead at 6.7 per cent, the highest recorded since 1981\". \nYet data from the Mortgage Bankers Association, published on April 9, showed mortgage applications up 20 per cent from a week earlier; the Refinance Index increased 35 per cent over the same period and was 93 per cent higher than the same week in 2024. Even though Americans might be nervous about real estate, it doesn't seem to be stopping them from making the investment.\nReal estate, of course, is fundamental to the economy of New York City, not least as a source of income for the authorities: since 2010, real estate-related taxes have provided an average of 51 per cent locally gathered taxes there. These revenues totalled $37bn in 2024; more than double the $18bn collected in 2010. The positive mood of the first quarter of 2025 suggested that this year could prove even better. But what was driving that unexpected fillip in the calendar, not to mention the general upward move? \nTop-price tickets to see Denzel Washington's middlingly reviewed turn as Othello opposite Jake Gyllenhaal's Iago hit $921\nOne significant element is the Great Return: to normal, to office and to New York City. Much was made of the flight from its cramped streets as Covid took hold, and as statistics from global location data company Melissa show: in 2020, the peak move month of August saw more than 35,000 moves away from NYC, versus 22,780 arrivals. Anecdotally, the city's population seemed to be deflating, like a punctured tire. Yet Melissa's figures show that the number of moves to the city in August 2024 were higher than in August 2019, before the pandemic: 19,636 versus 17,851. Census data showed that the city's population grew by 87,000 to 8.48mn people in the year to July 2024, a second year of growth following pandemic falls. \nAsk a real estate agent dealing with prime buyers in Manhattan and they'll offer an intriguing explanation as to who those arrivals -- or returnees -- are.\nRob Jackson is an agent with Corcoran. He facilitated 15 clients selling their city homes as a result of the pandemic, moving to the Hudson Valley or Connecticut. In late March this year, when a buyer went into contract on a one-bedroom co-op on the Upper East Side, they were the last of that 15 to buy back into Manhattan. \"When nobody knew when they would be returning to work full-time in person, if ever, they all left the city. But if you're a New Yorker, it's hard to go full-time to country living.\" \nJeremy Stein, of Sotheby's International Realty has seen the same rebound from many longtime clients, including one couple and their young child who moved to the tony commuter haven of New Canaan, Connecticut, and bought a $3mn home. They've just listed that property, with the intention of moving back to Manhattan, now as a family of four. \"We're racing around trying to find an apartment for them,\" he says, diplomatically. \"The lifestyle you have in the suburbs is not the lifestyle she wanted to lead.\"\nThat family is bucking the trend of the last few years: the under 5s population of New York dropped by 18 per cent between 2020 and 2023, while Department of City Planning data showed a decline in average household size of 5.49 per cent from 2020 to 2022.\nSmaller household size could, however, be a sign of the type of new arrivals, especially from a growing relocating tech sector. Smaller homes or pieds-a-terre are in high demand, according to Knight Frank's research head Liam Bailey. He points out that condo sales in the $1mn-$2mn range -- typically a one or two-bedroom home -- were up 42 per cent year on year in February 2025. \"No other segment in terms of price saw such strong growth.\" \nWhen nobody knew when they would be returning to work full-time in person, if ever, they all left the city. But if you're a New Yorker, it's hard to go full-time to country living\nCorcoran agent Jackson adds that smaller properties are also being snapped up by twenty and thirtysomething NYC residents. Some moved back in with their parents during Covid's bleakest period and so made savings on rent, accumulating that 20 per cent downpayment more easily than they might have anticipated.\nStill, not everyone's idea of best is bijoux, as two of Stein's clients highlight; both are west coast-based. One of them, a couple with young children, had planned to buy a NYC apartment before the pandemic; they pivoted and instead invested in a holiday home in Aspen. \"Two years ago, he called me and said, 'I can't get New York out of my system, let's go'. It took a week and we found him an apartment,\" says Stein. \nThe other family, empty nesters, already owned a pied-a-terre here, but decided to upsize after the wildfires in Los Angeles made them keener to spend more time on the east coast. \"They bought a bigger apartment, with three bedrooms, that can house the whole family,\" he says, of their trading up from an 1,800 sq ft home to one that's 50 per cent larger: \"It's a place they can spend more than the weekend in.\"\nWest coasters aside, an August 2024 report from PropertyShark on out-of-state buyers found that at the top end of the sector, Florida residents were the largest group investing in NYC, buying $315mn worth of real estate in the first six months of the year. Wendy Sarasohn from Brown Harris Stevens says that many who moved to Florida, often for tax reasons, have been starkly reminded that \"the New Yorkiness of New York is not anywhere else\". She shrugs: \"There are active bidding wars again.\" She cites a prewar co-op on the market just before Christmas for $10mn. \"The first two days they had 65 showings, and ended up with eight bids over asking, including one that was double.\" \nOne major change was also highlighted in that same report: a slump in international buyers. Among those buying property from out of state, the number of foreign buyers went down in the decade to 2024. In the first half of 2024, foreign buyers made up 0.3 per cent of home purchases, far fewer than the same period in 2014, when they comprised more than 1 per cent. \nWhether that downward trend will continue is likely reliant on whether push or pull factors win out. Push, of course, are tariffs, but for the very wealthy, there's the newly announced Gold Card visa, which allows foreigners to buy a Green Card-style permanent residency for $5mn. President Trump proudly displayed a prototype recently: a golden card, emblazoned with his photo and the words The Trump Card, among other details.\nThe uncertainty in the broader economy has -- at least until recently -- encouraged domestic buyers to park money in real estate, notes Angela Remigio, of Compass, who specialises in prime real estate in Manhattan. Many of her clients are \"pulling money from the market\", she says, noting that all but one of the recent deals she's handled, at up to $10mn, have been cash buyers. \"They've taken the full sum out of a big money market fund to pay for a new apartment.\" Last year all-cash deals in Manhattan regularly comprised around two-thirds of transactions: in April 2024, for example, they were at 64 per cent, compared with the national metro area average of 39 per cent, according to data from Marketproof and ATTOM respectively.\nMany who moved to Florida, often for tax reasons, have been starkly reminded that 'the New Yorkiness of New York is not anywhere else. There are active bidding wars again'\nBut what are they buying? Sarasohn says that prewar co-ops are back in fashion, after a period when they were seen as \"old ladies who got no attention at all\" beside the amenity-crammed new-builds that were flooding the market. Compass agent Collin Bond agrees, but cautions that only move-in-ready inventory is likely to sell quickly right now. Co-ops usually constrain renovations to a set time frame each day, often only over the summer; recent political developments make that an even dicier risk. \"Someone is going to think twice about buying something that needs a significant amount of work if tariffs are imposed and the cost to do construction goes up by 30 per cent,\" he says. \nRemigio also highlights time-sensitive potential among those newer buildings: some of the bigger developers are keen to close the sale of all inventory in existing projects so they can finance and move on to their next. If a top-tier building reaches 80-90 per cent sell-through, the developer can offer sweeteners to the final potential buyers. \"They could sell you the apartment at asking price, but throw in a storage unit, or pay the mansion tax or transfer tax -- some sort of deal in the back end,\" she says.\nSo much for demand, and its role in the resurgence of real estate here, but there are supply side factors in play, too, as Ryan Schleis, senior vice-president of research & analytics at Corcoran Sunshine, explains. \"We've seen a steep drop in inventory since Covid, and that is driven by two main factors,\" he says. \"Mortgage rates being where they are means people are waiting out the market, and there's a lot less new development entering the market than in the past [few years].\" Schleis cites data showing that new for-sale development inventory downtown peaked at the end of 2018, at 3,070 units; in the first quarter of 2025 the number was 900, or a 70 per cent decline. The for-sale pipeline south of 34th Street is 520 units annually (2025-2028), down 50 per cent from 1,020 units annually (2015-2024). \nThere are several reasons for the decline, he says. The 2019 Housing Stability and Tenant Protection Act made it much harder to convert rental buildings into condos, at any price point, while developers are also finding it much harder to underwrite large luxury new-builds like the 145-unit 56 Leonard (aka the Jenga building). \"Thirty to 60 residences in a prime location -- that's what they're seeing is selling well and what they can get financing to build.\"\nRecommended\nStill, agents are now holding their collective breath to see what Trump's tariff policy might mean for real estate here. \"April is the most important month of the year,\" says Stein, \"and uncertainty is the death knell for real estate, the exact opposite [scenario] of what a buyer of a home wants to be in.\" \nThere are already signs that it's cooling the market. Bond had one buyer who wired $300,000, a 10 per cent deposit for his $3mn purchase, before the first tariff press conference. Before Trump paused his policy on April 9, that buyer changed his mind. \"He was at the one-yard line, and decided, 'OK we're not going to sign because there's too much volatility right now,\" says Bond. \"That volatility is gripping people.\"\nFind out about our latest stories first -- follow @ft_houseandhome on Instagram",

Premium subscribers can sign up here to get the newsletter delivered every weekday. Standard subscribers can upgrade to Premium here, or explore all FT newsletters\nGood morning. President Donald Trump lashed out at Fed chair Jay Powell yesterday after Powell emphasised the risks posed by tariffs in a speech on Wednesday. Before Trump, it would have been unusual, and even alarming, for a president to openly rail against the Fed chair. But the market seems to be well prepared for such skirmishes: the S&P 500 was flat yesterday, and yields on the 10-year Treasury only ticked up 5 basis points. \nUnhedged will be off for Easter Monday, but back in your inboxes on Tuesday. Email me: aiden.reiter@ft.com. \nBig Tech has had a rough year: the Magnificent 7 stocks are down 22 per cent, and semiconductor stocks have taken a beating. With the exception of the January wobble caused by Chinese AI upstart DeepSeek, this seems to be more about market volatility than dents in the AI narrative. \nStill, the threat of slowing adoption is worth watching. Sam Tombs at Pantheon Macroeconomics points out that according to the recent regional surveys from the Federal Reserve, services businesses expect to dial back on IT and capital expenditure, having already cut spending in prior months (chart from Tombs; the capex intentions trend is expressed as an average of standard deviations relative to its 2015-2024 mean):\nThe most plausible justification for this is fear of slower economic growth. Most companies have not found a use case for AI yet, and the best models (ChatGPT, Gemini) have free versions. If you are the IT manager at a medium-sized company, with a potential recession looming, do you really want to approve a big AI line item?\nAnother explanation is that this could just be the new technology lifecycle in action. Other historical tech adoptions have also had moments of market underperformance and lower uptake, says Joseph Davis, chief economist at Vanguard and author of an upcoming book about tech cycles: \nIt's not always a straight line -- there are hiccups along the way . . . In every cycle, the tech sector underperforms for a significant period. [The] market underestimates new entrants, while [companies] ask: why are we putting money on this tech stack when we can go on cheaper tech stack in the future? We saw this with electricity [and other technologies].\nThen there's DeepSeek. The Chinese company's low-cost models demonstrated that end users do not necessarily need the best in class, and cheaper offerings may come from smaller players in the not-distant future. That could justify going more slowly on capex and adoption spending now.\nEven with falling expectations, many analysts see this as just momentary turbulence, and expect high adoption going forward. Here's Joseph Briggs at Goldman Sachs:\nThe real need of AI-related capex from an end user perspective is still seven years off. Just 7 per cent of companies currently report that they are using AI for the regular production of goods and services. While we have seen a pullback in capex expectations more broadly, I would think about this as being separate from the A theme, but rather related to a near-term headwind to investment related to trade policy uncertainty.\nGoldman still forecasts $300bn in AI-related investments by the end of 2025. But, as Briggs told me, that number is based on AI-exposed companies' revenue forecast revisions. As the outlook worsens, AI spending will probably drop, too. \nThe AI narrative is not dead. The market and business pullbacks look like an example of the familiar non-linearity of growth in new technologies. But if the US enters a multi-quarter recession -- and AI customers really start to cool their jets -- that could change.\nBrent Neiman is a professor at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business and recently served as the assistant secretary for international finance in the US Treasury department. Earlier this month, he made headlines when the White House's 'reciprocal tariff calculations misleadingly cited research done by Neiman and his colleagues. Unhedged spoke with him about that calculation, the price effects of tariffs and the future of the dollar.\nUnhedged: Could you walk us through the research cited by the White House?\nNeiman: The paper was written to measure the pass-through of the first Trump administration's 2018 tariffs into prices. At the time, there was a lot of discussion of how much foreign countries would pay for the tariffs, rather than the US. Theoretically, there's nothing incoherent about that -- it was possible that foreign exporters would reduce their prices to offset any imposed tariff. But it was also possible that there'd be very little change in pricing, forcing US importers or consumers to cover the tariff.\nWe decided to do an empirical analysis on this question, using data meant to represent the full basket of US imports. We found that US importers paid around 95 per cent of the 2018-19 tariff. For example, if there were a 20 per cent tariff, there would be a one percentage point reduction in the price charged by foreign exporters, and a 19 per cent increase in the prices faced by US importers. \nWe also looked at the price effects of Chinese retaliatory tariffs against the US. Interestingly, there was not the same effect. We found that US exporters dropped prices by more in response to China's tariffs than Chinese exporters did in response to US tariffs. So in some sense, US exporters paid a greater share of Chinese tariffs than the Chinese exporters paid of the US tariff.\nFinally, we traced it through as best we could to retail prices, using information from two large US retailers. Our research showed that pass-through was actually much lower for the retailers. One of the reasons may have been tariff front-running by retailers and suppliers, or because there was a shift in supply away from China's goods towards countries without US tariffs placed upon them.\nUnhedged: We would love to get to the implications of that, but first we want to ask more about how the White House used your research. What did they use? What did they get right, and what did they get wrong?\nNeiman: At a high level, I think the most important thing that they got wrong is to base trade policy around the goal of eliminating bilateral trade deficits. If you look in the numerator of their tariff formula, it's a measure of bilateral trade imbalances. There are many reasons why bilateral trade imbalances could arise -- different levels of development, or comparative advantage, or any number of other factors -- that have nothing to do with \"unfair\" practices.\nOur research seems to have shown up in their calculation of tariff pass-through. The wording that the White House used was they needed the pass-through of tariffs into import prices to make their equation; elsewhere they described it as the \"elasticity of import prices to tariffs\". In their methodology, they cite our paper close to that part of the equation. But then the actual number in their formula is 25 per cent, which is much lower than the 95 per cent pass-through we found.\nUnhedged: What do you imagine the price flow-through will be this time around? \nNeiman: I think there are some changes that will result in a higher pass-through. There is so much uncertainty, as you know, but there will likely be less scope for substitutes. For example, Vietnam was initially hit with a very high tariff rate. While that is lower now, that suggests that it will be less feasible for our sourcing to shift from China to its neighbours.\nIn our original paper, we also speculated that there were broad expectations that the trade war would not last long, giving businesses the ability to build inventories before tariffs took effect. That may have played a role in restraining price increases in 2018. But that seems less likely to hold now.\nAlso, the scale of these tariffs is off the charts, at least with respect to China. That will be salient to consumers and every pricing manager in the country. Research suggests that the salience of a cost shock really matters. So in this case, I think that it might be easier for firms to justify price increases, since everyone knows what's going on. It also might be something that firms have to absorb given the scale. If there's a small tariff, you might expect some margin compression; this is such a big tariff, it's hard to imagine that margin adjustment could cover very much of it.\nFinally, coming out of Covid, we saw that there were all sorts of shortages, often from non-linear bottleneck effects, where key components were missing. This led to cost increases. These tariffs are so broad and they've been deployed with such speed that something like that could occur again.\nUnhedged: We've started seeing some concern in the market that the new tariff regime will result in foreign purchasers turning away from the dollar. You've done a lot of research on the dollar; could you share your thoughts on its future?\nNeiman: I think it's helpful to take an expansive view on the role of the dollar. The dollar is disproportionately used in foreign reserves, import and export invoicing, to denominate external bonds, and in foreign exchange trading, among other uses. There are strong network effects between these uses. So I think it's reasonable to be cautious in expecting anything to change too rapidly in terms of the dollar's role. \nThere is a concern that, with the recent volatility and uncertainty around trade policy, the US more broadly may be viewed as less dependable. I do worry that that could lead foreign investors, and the counterparts in all of these roles of the dollar, to choose other assets over dollar-denominated assets. \nBut we need to be humble. There's basically only one historical data point that we have on a rapid shift away from the world's dominant currency, and that's the transition from the pound to the dollar. We have conjectured that the dollar's prevalence is due to strong rule of law, or deep in liquid markets and sound institutions. But we just don't have many observations to look at.\nUnhedged: One of the benefits of having the Treasury be the reserve asset of the world is it results in lower Treasury yields. How will the trade war affect the debt outlook?\nNeiman: One of the ways the trade war will impact US debt dynamics is even simpler than questions around dollar dominance. Tariffs are likely to have a very negative impact for US growth. At the end of 2024, economically speaking, we were in a really strong position: growth and productivity numbers looked great, unemployment was very low. We have now seen sell-side research economists at Goldman Sachs and other banks say that the recession risks are nearly 50 per cent, or even above that. Slower growth has implications for the size of the US debt relative to GDP.\nUnhedged: What else is on your mind at this moment?\nNeiman: I think one thing that is really important is the foreign policy implications from tariffs. I'm an economist, so I'm generally focused on the economic impact of these policies. But in this case, I think the damage may be even worse in terms of our foreign policy and global standing. I just spent three years in the Biden administration. In my role, there was a real diplomatic component to the job. I spent a lot of time working with foreign countries on all sorts of non-economic issues, like working with poorer countries to fight the financing of drug trafficking, terrorism and financial fraud, or to stem migration flows to the US. I look at the many countries that we're now tariffing, and I worry it will keep them from working with us, or doing so as enthusiastically, on these critical issues.\nI incorrectly described the non-model approach to calculating the term premium yesterday, though the numbers and graphs are still correct. The approach involves the yield on three-year one-month overnight index swaps -- not inflation swaps, as I wrote -- which is more accurately described as a risk-free asset related to expectations for the Fed, not inflation. Subtracting that series from the 10-year to 10-year forward rate gives the measure. My apologies.\nClass credit.\nCan't get enough of Unhedged?

      "summary": "Standstill shows how Sino-American trade war has spilled into the energy sector",
      "content": "Malcolm Moore in London\nPublishedApril 18 2025\nRoula Khalaf, Editor of the FT, selects her favourite stories in this weekly newsletter.\nChina's imports of US liquefied natural gas have completely stopped for more than 10 weeks, according to shipping data showing how the Sino-American trade war has spread to energy co-operation. \nSince a 69,000-tonne LNG tanker from Corpus Christi in Texas arrived in the southern province of Fujian on February 6 there have been no further shipments between the two countries. \nA second tanker was redirected to Bangladesh after it failed to arrive before China imposed a 15 per cent tariff on US LNG on February 10. The tariff has since increased to 49 per cent, making US natural gas uneconomic for Chinese buyers for the foreseeable future. \nThe freeze on US LNG is a repeat of a block on imports that lasted for more than a year during Donald Trump's first term as president. \nBut the impact of the stand-off has potentially far-reaching implications, strengthening China's energy relationship with Russia and raising questions over the huge expansion of multibillion-dollar LNG terminals that is under way in the US and Mexico.\n\"There will be long-term consequences,\" said Anne-Sophie Corbeau, a natural gas specialist at Columbia University's Center on Global Energy Policy. \"I do not think Chinese LNG importers will ever contract any new US LNG.\"\nRecommended\nSince Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, China has imported a relatively low share of its LNG from the US, with Chinese buyers preferring to resell the fuel into Europe for a profit. Last year, only 6 per cent of China's LNG came from the US, down from a peak of 11 per cent in 2021.\nHowever, Chinese companies including PetroChina and Sinopec have signed 13 long-term contracts to buy LNG from US terminals, some of which run to 2049, according to data from Kpler. \nSuch long-term deals were essential for getting huge LNG projects off the ground in the US, though Corbeau said developers have recently tried to renegotiate terms to take into consideration rising inflation and the costs from US tariffs.\nGillian Boccara, an analyst at Kpler, said she saw no reason for trade between the two countries to restart in the short term. \n\"The last time this happened, there was a complete hiatus until the Chinese authorities granted waivers to companies, but that was at a time when gas demand was booming,\" she said. \"Now we are looking at lower economic growth, and we think the Chinese can withstand the loss of these cargoes for quite a long time.\"\nRecommended\nChina's ambassador to Russia said earlier this week that China would probably step up its imports of Russian LNG instead. \"I know for sure that there are a lot of buyers. So many buyers are asking the embassy to help establish contacts with Russian suppliers, I think there will definitely be more [imports],\" said Zhang Hanhui.\nRussia has emerged as the third-largest supplier of LNG to China, behind Australia and Qatar; the two countries have also been negotiating over a new natural gas pipeline, the Power of Siberia 2. \n\"With tariffs rising to the level where they are an effective embargo, we will see a reshuffling of trade flows,\" said Richard Bronze, at Energy Aspects, an energy consultancy. \"We also expect Asia demand to fall by 5mn to 10mn tonnes as a whole. That should bring gas prices down a bit in Europe.\"",
      "ml_hf_summary": "China has halted imports of US liquefied natural gas (LNG) for over ten weeks, marking the continuation of trade tensions between the two countries. This follows China's imposition of tariffs on US LNG, increasing to 49% from 15%, making it economically unfeasible for Chinese buyers.  The halt is similar to a previous block during Donald Trump's presidency and has potential long-term consequences for US LNG exports.  China's reliance on Russian LNG has increased as a result of the trade standoff, with China's ambassador to Russia stating that they expect increased imports from Russia. This shift in trade flows is expected to impact both the US and European gas markets. \n"

And, over the last six years, that number among men has shot from 4% to 21%.\nMore young women also started attending church, increasing from 3% to 12%.\nListen to the latest episode of \"Quick Start\" \n News of more members of Generation Z attending church comes on the heels of a report last summer from CBN News detailing a spiritual awakening unfolding across the U.K.\n\"Between 2020 and 2023, I found myself often saying that I've never seen the church at such a low ebb that it just felt like we were going through the motions post-COVID, that churches were struggling, their numbers were down,\" said Pastor Craig Cooney, who leads Hope Church in Northern Ireland. \"But not only were their numbers down, there was just a lack of zeal, lack of passion, a lack of enthusiasm, a lack of growth. And something shifted around the start of this year, I would say, and it's difficult to describe or define.\"\nLast summer, for example, 70,000 people gathered in London's Trafalgar Square to hear the Gospel.\nTracking with that shift, the Bible Society study showed church attendance is on the rise among a number of demographics, including Generation Z, Millennials, and those above 65 years old.\nChurch attendance overall has risen by some 50% in the U.K. over the last six years.\nOne of the study's co-authors, Dr. Rhiannon McAleer, said the study's findings challenge the belief that the church in the U.K. \"is in terminal decline.\"\n\"While some traditional denominations continue to face challenges, we've seen significant, broad-based growth among most expressions of Church -- particularly in Roman Catholicism and Pentecostalism,\" she said. \"There are now over two million more people attending church than there were six years ago.\"\nAnd the shift seems to be very real.\nJohn Stevens, a pastor in the English town of Market Harborough, wrote in a recent post for The Gospel Coalition that ministry \"has been more encouraging than at any other point in the past 20 years.\"\nInterestingly, Stevens credits at least some of the shift to the mass migration into the U.K. in recent years, noting there is currently a net migration rate of 728,000 people per year. The notable upticks in the number of Catholics and Pentecostals are \"almost certainly a result of migration from Africa and elsewhere, bolstering the number of church attenders,\" he wrote.\n\"The U.K. population has grown by a little less than 2 million people since 2018, which is almost the same as the increase in church attendance,\" he added. \"The overall statistics conceal the challenge of re-evangelizing the White British population and the ethnic minorities that migrated to the U.K. in the post-war period.\"\nEven with that in mind, he expressed reasons for hopefulness. Stevens noted there \"does seem to be a new move of God in the United Kingdom and a greater openness and response among young people, especially men\" as younger generations have become disenchanted with \"mainstream churches that have abandoned the biblical Gospel in favor of a liberalism that reflects the progressive culture.\"\nShare This article \n Tre Goins-Phillips serves as a host and content creator for CBN News.

      "summary": "“Do you want to meet the Michael Jordan of Bible translation?”",
      "content": "Share This article\n\"Do you want to meet the Michael Jordan of Bible translation?\"\nIt was early in the 2010s, and Jordan Monson was a low-level Bible translation intern. He was attending a conference when a friend posed that question to him.\nUnsure who it might be, Monson assented to the offer and was understandably surprised when he turned to see an English woman in her early 70s with a bit of a limp walking toward him.\n\"I noticed around the room as all of these senior leaders ... the whole room just stopped ... and everyone just looked to her and, one by one, these incredibly important people walked up to her,\" Monson recalled, jokingly adding, \"The only way they could show more reverence is if they bowed; it was crazy.\"\nListen to the latest episode of \"Quick Start\" \n Needless to say, the burgeoning scholar was determined to learn more about Dr. Katharine Barnwell. And he quickly discovered she is one of the most influential missionaries people have never heard of.\nIn the West, notoriety is seen as a byproduct of influence -- but that's not always the case. In fact, Barnwell's obscurity spins that aforementioned assumption on its head: her ambiguity in the greater \"evangelical industrial complex,\" as Monson called it, is because she was busy working, mostly in West Africa, to make Scripture accessible to people who had never heard the Gospel.\n\"She sort of slipped away from the limelight, or she was never noticed,\" he said. \"But if you look at the number of people in the world who have become Christians, largely because of her work, there is a very real claim to her having more than 100 times the influence of Billy Graham. [It's] just incredible.\"\nA post shared by Tre Goins-Phillips (@tregp)\nIn the years since that conference where he first encountered Barnwell, Monson has become a true student of her work.\nHe is the author of a forthcoming biography about the notable missionary, \"Katharine Barnwell: How One Woman Revolutionized Modern Missions,\" releasing April 29 and available now for pre-order.\nAs missionary work has shifted away from solely an export of the Western world, reorienting around the global church, Barnwell's quiet influence has left an indelible mark.\n\"All around the missions world, people were looking to lift up the nations, lift up the global church, and say, 'The Westerners have been doing this for 400-some years, with some success and also with some major blindspots along the way.' ... It was time to pass the baton and hand it off to the local church,\" Monson explained. \"Katy Barnwell ... trained the world to translate the Scriptures for themselves.\"\nBarnwell, 87, is the pioneer of the \"mother-tongue\" translation method of the Bible. Having spent a great deal of her career in Nigeria, the faithful linguist centered her work on establishing a system for communities to access the Old and New Testaments in their heart languages.\nHer technique, now known as the Barnwell Translation Method, is used extensively and mostly, as it was designed, by non-professional translators. The goal of the system is threefold: to accurately communicate biblical meaning, to employ natural and clearly understood language, and to remain steadfastly faithful to the intent of the original text.\nWith a team of community translators, Barnwell's method relies on the source text's original languages (mostly Greek and Hebrew), focuses on meaning- and ideas-based translation (as opposed to word-for-word translation), and then, to sure up the precision of the translation, requires drafts to be back-translated into major languages (like English or French). The system also features exhaustive linguistic and exegetical workshops to equip local translators with the tools they need to achieve their goal.\nDespite her unprecedented success and indisputable contribution to Bible translation, Monson described Barnwell, who still works in linguistics, as \"maybe the most humble person I've ever met,\" recalling, for example, how bothered she was to even see her face on the cover of her biography.\nThat exchange, he said, is emblematic of her whole life philosophy.\n\"She just works tirelessly for the good of people around the world and thinks so little about herself that she's almost offended when she's remembered,\" Monson said. \"She kept insisting the whole time, 'Everything I did, I did on teams; I don't know why this whole book is just about me.'\"\nThat attitude -- Barnwell's counterintuitive humility -- has served as a deep encouragement to Monson.\n\"What does it look like to be laser-focused on the Kingdom, laser-focused on the spreading of the Good News of Jesus while having a complete self-forgetfulness about your own person?\" he reflected.\nYou can watch our full conversation with Monson in the \"Faith vs. Culture\" episode below: \n Share This article \n Tre Goins-Phillips serves as a host and content creator for CBN News.

Ryan Girdler was an outstanding player for our club, and that's a lot of points too, it's very cool and he should be proud of it.\"\nPenrith No. 7 Cleary is just 27.\nIf he can keep himself fit, then can he envisage overtaking Cameron Smith (2786 points) and becoming the greatest scorer in the history of Australian rugby league by the time he retires?\n\"That's pretty far away,\" the playmaker cautioned.\n\"Those are little things that you can tick off along the way but the more important journey was getting the win tonight, getting back on track and feeling like ourselves again.\"\nBut things could have well gone the other way after the Roosters struck just four minutes in when Daniel Tupou crossed off a Mark Nawaqanitawase pass.\nThe Roosters were pushing to add a second in quick succession and again Nawaqanitawase was the attacking outlet.\nHis offload was hacked forward towards the in-goal by Tedesco who collided with Edwards as he raced after the ball.\nTedesco fell to the ground and appealed for Edwards to face punishment but the bunker deemed the Panthers fullback's contact was incidental.\nAfter a Naufahu Whyte high shot on the ensuing set, Penrith quickly found themselves up the other end where Cleary and Edwards combined twice to send Paul Alamoti over.\nCleary converted both Alamoti tries to surpass Girdler's points tally to give Penrith a 12-6 halftime lead.\nCleary kicked a penalty goal soon into halftime and then the Panthers really began to turn the screws.\nIsaiah Papali'i, Blaize Talagi, Edwards, who went in off a delightful Scott Sorensen offload, and Casey McLean all crossed to inflict more misery on the Roosters in the final 30 minutes.\nPenrith's sole slip-up came when Edwards spilled a ball coming out of his own end and Rob Toia struck off a well-worked Roosters scrum play.\nThe Roosters slumped to 2-5 and have now been outscored 120-38 in their three home games at Allianz Stadium this season.\nCoach Trent Robinson blasted a Mitch Kenny hip-drop tackle that went unpunished and has sidelined utility forward Nat Butcher with a medial ligament injury.\nHe was also surprised Edwards did not spend time in the bin for his collision with Tedesco.\n\"We got beaten over the course of the whole game but they're big moments,\" Robinson said.\nSign up for our emails\nFind out More\n(c) West Australian Newspapers Limited 2025",
      "ml_hf_summary": "Penrith Panthers defeated Sydney Roosters 40-12 in an NRL match on Saturday night, with Nathan Cleary surpassing Ryan Girdler's club points record.  The Panthers started the game poorly but found their rhythm in the second half, scoring five tries and a penalty goal to secure victory. Cleary kicked six conversions and a penalty goal, totaling 1573 points for his career. The Roosters were initially ahead after a Daniel Tupou try, but Penrith responded with two tries from Paul Alamoti and Isaiah Papali'i before halftime.  The Panthers continued their dominance in the second half, adding further tries from Dylan Edwards, Blaize Talagi, Casey McLean, and Scott Sorensen.  The loss leaves the Roosters at 2-5 while the Panthers improve to 1-5. \n"

      "content": "Think of South-East Asia as we think of Europe -- a contrasty mix of countries, except its right on our doorstep, with plenty of direct flights and one-stop hops.\nAnd our winter is the time to consider dipping into it. Virtually all of South-East Asia is between the tropics, so temperatures are generally pretty warm, though it's cooler in highland areas.\nEven as the world rocks and reels financially, South-East Asia (the countries between China and India) can still offer us great value, close to home.\nFor some readers, it will be a return to old backpacking haunts -- but maybe in more comfort, on small-group tours or river cruises.\nFor others who have travelled widely, particularly in Europe, and transited and stopped-over in South-East Asia, it might even free like a new idea.\nThe membership of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) gives us an idea of which countries we're talking about -- Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, Malaysia, the Philippines, Indonesia, Brunei and Myanmar.\nVariety is on our doorstep, from clean high-rise cities to rural wellness retreats, islands to rice fields. From shiny shopping centres to cheap hawker stalls. From rainforests to curated gardens.\nWe might be on efficient public transport, in tuk tuks and taxis, and just walking side streets and alleyways.\nAnd, of course we'll be eating. The countries of South-East Asia leave a lingering tingle through their cuisine -- pho in Vietnam; pad Thai in Thailand; nasi goreng in Indonesia; chilli crab in Singapore; laksa in Malaysia.\nThe experiences are varied -- and my mind easily jumps through that variety ...\n+ In Singapore, we have a comfortable, engaging, safe and green city which is easy to get around, and has plenty to see and do. In Malaysia, I'd think first of the islands of Langkawi (for a quiet, beach-and-forest getaway) and Penang (for street life, food and history).\nFor textbook tropical islands and great resorts, we should filter through the Thai islands, from Ko Samui (busy because of The White Lotus) to classic Koh Chang and quiet Koh Kood. Phuket is simply fun.\nIn Vietnam, I'm tending away from the busy south and Ho Chi Minh city to the north, with Hanoi as \"first base\", then travelling inland to Sapa, to walk between villages, where we can stay. Sapa sits under the peaks of the Hoang Lien Son Mountain Range. It has big highland views and stacked rice terraces. This is the land of eight ethnic minorities, who together form one of the strongest cultural areas in Vietnam. If you like markets, head for Muong Hum or Bac Ha. In central Vietnam, Da Nang is the base, and a pleasant place to stroll, shop and eat.\nThe heart of Cambodia is surely in the temples of Angkor Wat. Just remember that there are lots of temples (which we have written about many time in these pages) in Angkor Wat Archaeological Park, so allow plenty of time in the town of Siem Reap. Cycle around in the early morning. Soak it in. I stay at Villa Um Theara, a three-star local hotel (with mainly Cambodians) for less than $50 a night.\nLaos still has charm, though it has become a big hub for international backpackers (drinkers) and those seeking adventurous thrills. In Vientiane, I'll still head first to Phra That Luang and Wat Si Muang temples.\nThe region is themed by cultural diversity.\nOne example -- that about 6000 languages are spoken in the world, and 1000 of them are heard in South-East Asia.\nHumans have inhabited the region for about a million years, as archaeological findings reveal.\nTribal groups wandered in from southern China, following river systems.\nThese ancestors adapted to the local environment in many ways. The orang laut sea people lived permanently in small boats. In the deep jungles, there were many tribes, family groups and head-hunters.\nBut while many premodern humans were nomadic, perhaps collecting the fruit of the lontar palm or sago, others settled on the fertile river plains and planted and grew rice. Sedentary coastal communities fished and traded.\nChange came rapidly about 2000 years ago with the expansion of Chinese people south of the Yangtze River. They colonised Vietnam. In the west, Indian influence became more obvious in the Malay-Indonesian archipelago.\nAnd in central South-East Asia, people settled and farmed from northern Vietnam through Cambodia, Thailand, Myanmar, Java and Bali.\n+ Putting gold leaf on the back of a Buddha image. (Doing good deeds without seeking attention.) -- Thai saying\n+ If you dip your arm into the pickle pot let it be up to the elbow -- Malaysian proverb\n+ Drop by drop fills the bamboo container -- Cambodian saying\n+ When you've heard it you must see it; when you've seen it make a judgement with your heart -- Laotian proverb\nSingapore A city full of greenery, with lots of gardens and parks, but also spectacular new buildings, reliably good hotels and older areas to wander, like \"old Singapore\" between Raffles Hotel and Clarke Quay, Little India and Chinatown. But it's not cheap.\nThailand Of course, there's the big city stopover of Bangkok (try its markets in the evening), and I'm happy to couple that with a quick hop north to Chiang Mai or (better still) Chiang Rai, by the Mekong River. That gives a city-country contrast. And then, of course, there are those picture-perfect islands -- an extension of the karst reef system that extended to Halong Bay in northern Vietnam.\nVietnam In the north, Hanoi is busy but easy. The French influence is still just visible (in the bakeries, if nothing else). The food is good. Da Nang and Hoi An, in the centre, are still favourites, for their charm.\nIn the south, Ho Chi Minh City is really busy, and only for two or three days, in my book.\nCambodia From inland jungles to the Mekong River with its big delta, it pretty well all feels rural and close to nature. The big city experience is in Phnom Penh, but I would pretty quickly head to Siem Reap.\nLaos Luang Prabang and Vientiane retain charm, but its become quite busy and some is becoming more developed.\nMalaysia Big cities and jungles, and the islands of the Malacca Strait, and Sabah on Borneo. Quite affordable shopping and decent food.\nPhilippines Fly direct from Perth to Manila, and head to cities, islands and beaches. But don't venture south of Cebu.\nTimor-Leste Fly between Darwin and Dili in about an hour for an off-the-beaten-track experience. History and culture, beaches and reefs and the mountains of the interior.\n+ Singapore Airlines has been named Roy Morgan Research 2024 International Airline of the Year for the fifth time. The announcement was made on April 10 at the annual Customer Satisfaction Awards. SIA was recognised as the Best International Airline for customer satisfaction. Louis Arul, SIA's regional vice-president South West Pacific, said: \"Australia is one of our most significant markets, and for more than 55 years of operations Down Under, our customers' comfort, travel experience and safety have remained our top priorities.\n+ AirAsia plans to introduce more than 30 new routes in 2025, building better connectivity throughout ASEAN countries. The proposed acquisition of AirAsia by AirAsia X Berhad is almost complete, and this consolidation of short and medium-haul airlines into one big aviation group will further improve the airline's position. In 2025, AirAsia will focus on enhancing cost leadership, optimising network and flight frequencies, and improving performance in Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia, the Philippines, and Cambodia.\n+ Vietjet, which flies direct between Perth and Vietnam, is planning to have nearly 300 new aircraft between 2025 and 2027. It has signed a $US300 million financing agreement with AV AirFinance -- an agreement which forms part of a broader series of aircraft financing commitments exceeding $US4 billion.\nWhile travelling footloose and independently is still pretty simple in South-East Asia, others will like the planning and organisation done for them -- and enjoy travelling with new, like-minded friends on tours.\nEither way, always remember that a good guide can bring a place alive.\nIntrepid Travel has very good itineraries in South-East Asia. The itinerary for its 24-day Premium South-East Asia in Depth in Vietnam, Cambodia and Thailand is impressing, and it is from $10,009 per person (without international airfares). I'd also look at the 15-day Premium Vietnam in Depth and Premium Java and Bali -- for something familiar, but with a big twist. intrepidtravel.com/au\nInspiring Vacations also has good South-East Asia itineraries. Travellers who just want to dip into it all might look at its 27-day \"Grand South-East Asia Premium Small Group Tour\", with a Mekong cruise included. It is from $7799 (without international airfares, which can be added for $1299). There's a maximum of 20 guests. inspiringvacations.com\nThere are plenty of coastal, ocean cruises in South-East Asia -- and they offer great value.\nExamples include an 18-night package on Westerdam from Hong Kong to Vietnam, Cambodia, Thailand and Singapore -- all from $3990 per person. mycruises.com.au\nAnd there are good river cruise package -- like Imagine Holidays' 21-night \"Luxury All-Inclusive Mekong River Cruise with Vietnam and Cambodia Discovery\" from $6999 per person. The river cruise is on Mekong Navigator. imagineholidays.com.au\nAPT has seven-night cruises on its luxury river cruise ship Mekong Serenity. aptouring.com\nKuta, Legian and Seminyak are still Bali's Big Three along the west coast. Of those, \"legian\" means \"sweet\" in Balinese, and is my pick of those. (Canggu may be the new Seminyak. It's just a bit to the north, and quieter, with black sand beach.)\nBut, beyond the Big Three ...\nNusa Dua This is upmarket Bali, with the nice Geger Beach. On the Bukit Peninsula's east coast, there are luxury resorts and hotels, spas and golf courses.\nSanur This has a family atmosphere. In the south-east, there is a boardwalk, soft sand, gentle surf and easy access to the beach. There are lots of places to eat.\nJimbaran It has some luxurious resorts though its history as a quiet fishing village isn't too far under its skin. Good for beaches and seafood.\nKintamani For those who like a bit more activity, this is a good spot, in Bali's north-east. It is easy to hire a local guide in one of the small towns around Mount Batur. There are day walks and the temple Pura Ulun Danu Batur.\nWhile so many cities are covering themselves with concrete, Singapore has been transformed into a \"city in a garden\". This dates back to 1963, and the vision of former prime minister Lee Kuan Yew. He wanted shade trees for walkers and public parks for families.\nWe could, perhaps, learn from what he said in 1980: \"Singapore can become a green, shady city filled with fruits and flowers. A city worthy of an industrious people whose quest, progress is matched by their appreciation of beauty, of nature. The harshness of tarmac, concrete can be softened by the natural trees, flowers and birds.\"\nIt is now \"a city in a garden\", with Singapore's Parks and Recreation Department continuing the campaign by \"aggressively planting as well as developing parks\".\nThe highlight are the Gardens by the Bay.\n+ Singaporeans love to eat. Singapore-style chicken rice is a national dish. The chicken is thoroughly cooked in boiling water then kept in cold water to keep it tender. Hainanese style rice is served with red chilli sauce dip. Ideally, the rice is cooked in chicken stock with ginger and pandan leaves. There are strict and policed health standards, and visitors can have confidence in authentic street food.\n+ Stroll around \"old Singapore\" -- Clarke Quay, Orchard Road, Chinatown, Little India and the Arab Quarter.\n+ Sentosa Island has become its own destination, and is particularly suited to families, as it has Resorts World Sentosa and lots of other places to spend time.\nIn hotels across South-East Asia, Easter is being celebrated in quite different ways.\nHong Kong The Hari Hong Kong celebrates Easter from April 18 to 21 with brunches and set dinners in its many restaurants. In its restaurant Zoku, ichya boshi with charcoal threadfin fish and daikon oroshi is coupled with wines and sakes.\nCambodia The Raffles Grand Hotel d'Angkor in Siem Reap has an Easter Sunday Champagne Brunch in Cafe d'Angkor on April 20. The renowned local Janvier Patisserie is producing a trompe l'oeil dessert.\nVietnam The classic, 124-year-old Sofitel Legend Metropole Hanoi has an Easter-themed high tea in the Le Club Bar (always somewhere to head for). An Easter egg scavenger hunt is among the fun at Alma Resort Cam Ranh near Nha Trang -- an area to have on your radar.\nSign up for our emails\nFind out More\n(c) West Australian Newspapers Limited 2025",

      "content": "Fremantle coach Justin Longmuir has questioned his team's toughness for the second time this season after they lost to previously winless Melbourne by 10 points at the MCG.\nThe Dockers entered the game chasing their fourth win in a row and were considered favourites against a Demons like up that was under intense pressure in 17th spot on the ladder.\nBut Melbourne controlled the game as Kysaiah Pickett booted five goals and Max Gawn dominated the ruck, to kick their highest score of the season and win 16.11 (107) to 14.13 (97).\nThe Demons won the contested possessions by 18 and dominated the middle of the ground, winning the centre clearances 20-11. They out tackled Fremantle 59-45 and that included 27 tackles inside 50 to the Dockers' four.\nLongmuir questioned his team's toughness after being thrashed by Geelong in round one and he raised the same issue after the loss to Melbourne.\n\"I'm disappointed with the way we played. I didn't think we were tough enough,\" he said.\n\"I felt like we didn't value the right things. We didn't defend the front half the way we want to defend our front half. They had over 70 points at half-time. That's not the team we want to be.\n\"You lose the contested ball. Some of that's method. Some of that's just grunt. To go down in the tackles as well - we didn't put enough pressure on them after they won it. It was too easy. They were able to find their teammates, get to the outside of us. We didn't handle that well.\"\nLongmuir said the lack of pressure being applied around the ground was dramatically different to last season and is something that desperately needs to be addressed. He declared the team hung the defenders out to dry.\nGawn's performance against Sean Darcy and Oscar McDonald was crucial as he finished with 28 disposals,10 clearances and 31 hit outs. Darcy was playing only his second game of the year after an injury interrupted pre-season and Luke Jackson remains unavailable.\nLongmuir said he would have to re-consider the decision to select only one specialist ruckman.\n\"We got taught a lesson in there,\" he said.\n\"They scored heavily from centre bounce. Ultimately you could say that was the difference in the game. They kicked five goals, We kicked one and the difference was 10 points.\"\nFremantle have injury concerns with Jaeger O'Meara facing scans on his hamstring ahead of Friday night's game against Adelaide. Heath Chapman was a late withdrawal due to illness.\nLongmuir said Chapman would have played on Pickett and said the team struggled to handle the star Demon playing two roles.\n\"He starts in the centre bounce and then flips forward,\" he said.\n\"At times we got hat handover right. At times we saw that through the right way. At times we didn't. A lot of his goals came from him winning contests or getting goal side of his opponent. He's a good player obviously. We need to get better at handling those flips out of the midfield.\"\nSign up for our emails\nFind out More\n(c) West Australian Newspapers Limited 2025",

      "content": "\"Don't let her fall asleep,\" our hiking guide, Raj \"Razz\" Neaupane says.\nDespite the sleeping bag, woollen blanket, two layers of thermals, socks, gloves, beanie and puffer jacket wrapped tight around me, I cannot stop shaking with cold.\nAs I try to still the shivers vibrating through my body, my breathing slows, puffs of air unfurling in white clouds in front of my mouth.\nMy close friend and trekking companion, Sana, walks in. Her face is tense with worry as she hurries over to my bedside to confirm my worst fear: \"Razz has contacted the rescue team in Kathmandu. There's an evac helicopter on standby.\"\nIf my blood oxygen level keeps dropping, I'll be airlifted before the day is out. It doesn't matter that we're only a few hours walk from Everest Base Camp, after seven days of hiking. I have no say.\nWe arrived at Gorak Shep, in the Himalayan region of Khumbu, less than an hour ago, after a brutal seven-hour hike from Dingboche.\nThe small village is the final stop on our journey to the base of Mt Everest, the highest peak in the world and one of the most iconic amongst hikers and nature-lovers. Sitting at an altitude of 5146m, Gorak Shep, which translates as \"Dead Ravens\" (because nothing lives there), lacks the protection of any kind of vegetation, exposing trekkers using the hamlet as their final stop on the way to Everest Base Camp to extreme cold, strong winds, and 50 per cent less oxygen than at sea level.\nIt means the risk of altitude sickness, which can be life-threatening, is even higher here than at any of the other settlements hikers embarking on the 11-day trek to and from EBC visit.\nBefore it can become fatal, altitude sickness, also known as mountain sickness, can cause symptoms like headache, shortness of breath, nausea, dizziness, vomiting, lethargy, loss of appetite, and reduced co-ordination.\nI am currently experiencing five of these.\nThe most effective treatment option is descending to a lower elevation. And that's exactly what Razz is intending for me.\nEver since I started hurling up my lunch of tomato soup and a toasted sandwich outside, he's been on high alert.\nFor the past six days, usually after a steaming hot bowl of dahl, he's used a small pulse oximeter to measure mine and my friend Sana's blood oxygen levels. And every night, we've both returned percentages between 90 and 95.\nBut now the number that flashes across the screen as the device clamped around my pointer finger beeps is enough to trigger another wave of nausea. 72 per cent. My blood oxygen saturation has dropped more than 18 points since my last reading 18 hours ago.\nI've been plagued by unpleasant but manageable symptoms of altitude sickness for the past seven days -- since we started our breathtaking hike (both literally and figuratively) from Llukla -- home to the infamous \"most dangerous airport in the world\", with a 527m runway right off a cliff edge -- to EBC.\nOften referred to as the roof of the world, Mt Everest isn't actually visible from the Nepalese base camp (5364m above sea level) -- despite the peak's imposing height. But if you're lucky, like we have been so far, there are multiple viewpoints along the well-trodden trail from which you can spot the mountain's majestic summit.\nAn hour after my condition sent Razz sprinting for the satellite phone that connects him to his boss back in Kathmandu, and the evacuation teams servicing the Khumbu Pasang Lhamu rural municipality, I've stabilised.\nI'm still feeling sick, but the cold I couldn't seem to shake before has receded, and I'm not overrun with crippling exhaustion. And in yet another stroke of luck -- or stubbornness -- my blood oxygen levels begin to climb.\nAnd the next morning, with the pulse oximeter's blessing, so do we. The final push is fuelled by pure adrenaline. Nothing will motivate you more than the very fresh memory of the pain of dozens of blisters popping against the sweaty soles of your boots, or calves so stiff they're like guitar strings ready to snap.\nAnother driving force is the weather. It's -15C, but with the biting wind, which feels like it's carving your face from stone with every gust, it feels even colder.\nFinally, after kilometres of ice-blue glaciers, giant ridges and loose rocks underfoot, prayer flags rise like a finish line in the distance.\nAs I stand in the shadow of the world's tallest mountain, feelings of exhaustion, pride and disbelief that I actually made it mix with a stream of tears.\nI've dreamed of achieving this goal for years -- not for a summit, but to test my limits and push beyond what is comfortable and easy. The Himalayas stripped away all my ego and expectation, replacing it with humility, acceptance of what is out of my control, and sheer will.\nAnd as we begin our four-day descent, I realise this achievement is just the beginning.

      "content": "A fresh argument has broken out on industrial relations over the holiday weekend, with Peter Dutton labelling a Labor move to legislate protections for penalty rates a stunt and a \"red herring\".\nPrime Minister Anthony Albanese and his cabinet colleague Jason Clare harked back to their university days working hospitality jobs to recognise how much help the extra pay for working night shifts or weekends could be.\nThe Fair Work Commission is considering an application from the Australian Retailers Association, backed by the Australian Industry Group, to amend the relevant award so that supervisors, including those at the big supermarkets, could voluntarily agree to swap penalty rates for a higher salary.\nThere are more than 1.3 million retail workers across the country, including 350,000 on the award the employer groups are seeking to change.\nWorkplace Relations Minister Murray Watt made a submission in his ministerial capacity to the Fair Work Commission on the matter in February, which argued that penalty and overtime rates were an \"essential feature of minimum terms and conditions\" in awards.\nOn Saturday, he described the threat to people's pay as very real.\n\"Weekends and public holidays are special. That's when we gather for birthday parties, it's when we have weddings, it's when we have football grand finals,\" he said.\n\"And the workers who give up those weekends and public holidays deserve recognition for that with extra pay in the form of penalty rates.\"\nLabor now intends to legislate guidance for the commission that penalty rates rightly belong in award agreements.\nBusiness groups joined forces to warn that doing so would set a dangerous precedent of governments interfering in independent processes.\nMr Albanese said the only precedent was that of Labor defending the rights of working people.\n\"That's something we've been doing since 1891, so if there's a precedent there, we've been doing it since 1891,\" he said.\nHe recalled working night shifts at Pancakes on the Rocks in Sydney \"for the penalty rates, that's one of the things that got me through university\".\nMr Clare said the same went for his days working at Sizzler to help him get through university.\n\"It paid for the public transport, it paid for the food, it paid for my life,\" he said.\nMr Dutton said the move was \"yet another stunt\" from Labor, given the independent Fair Work Commission set the conditions.\n\"We don't propose any departure from the current arrangements,\" he said.\n\"We support the policy that the Gillard-Rudd government supported, that the Albanese government supported, that the Morrison and Turnbull and Abbott governments supported.\n\"Let's have a mature debate instead of these red herrings.\"\nBut Mr Albanese blasted the Coalition as \"the party of Work Choices\" that had \"never missed an opportunity to undermine the wages and conditions of working people\".\nThis talk of the importance of weekends and family time took place at the Sydney Royal Easter Show on Saturday, where both leaders visited after a pause in campaigning on Good Friday.\nJoe Spagnolo\nKatina Curtis\nThe show has become a staple of the campaign trail with the shift of elections to the first half of the year.\nMr Dutton arrived well before the gates opened to the public, but ended up staying on as the showgrounds at Sydney Olympic Park filled up, picking up some meat pies and a Bertie Beetle showbag along the way.\n\"I love the Afro, I'm jealous,\" he told an alpaca, patting its bouffant 'do.\nYet another poll released on Saturday showed the Coalition dropping further behind Labor.\nLiberal insiders now think the party will pick up at best 10 seats, putting it well short of a majority.\nBut Mr Dutton dismissed concerns, saying there was a \"big disparity\" between the published polls and \"what we're seeing\" in internal Liberal Party tracking.\n\"I also think there are a lot of Australians, frankly, who just haven't switched their mind yet to the choices and what they're doing on election day,\" he said, declining to make any predictions.\nKatina Curtis\nHe had no such qualms about asking 18-year-old cattle handler Clancy Lambkin how he thought his cows would go in the competition.\n\"We're hoping for blue ribbons, but predictions? We'll go with blue ribbons for now,\" Mr Lambkin replied.\nMr Albanese got down with the kids in a goat pen where the baby animals jumped all over him and his partner Jodie Haydon.\n\"I hope it's as chill for the last couple of weeks as this little one,\" he said, cuddling a sleepy baby goat before saying they still had \"a mountain to climb\" to polling day.\nHe continues to insist no one in Labor is getting ahead of themselves.\n\"Everyone knows what happened in 2019 where the bookies paid out a few days before the election, and that was pretty unwise,\" he said, echoing the concerns of ALP members still burned by that year's shock loss.\nSign up for our emails\nFind out More\n(c) West Australian Newspapers Limited 2025",

It's more all the forwards and I just get lucky out in the end, but it's always nice and I'll claim it,\" Pollard said.\n\"Their bench is one of the best, if not the best, in the comp so to come on and try and just nullify with what they were doing was really important for us,\" Pollard said.\n\"We spoke at halftime as a bench just to make sure that we come on and everyone nails their jobs and I suppose just nail your role too.\"\nSign up for our emails\nFind out More\n(c) West Australian Newspapers Limited 2025",

Pickett electrified the game with four goals in the first half. He finished with five goals and 24 disposals.\nHe was everywhere. Pickett started in the centre square and then drifted forward to create havoc.\nHis first goal came from a classy gather below his knees and then snap. He then nailed Andrew Brayshaw with a tackle and set up a goal for Trent Rivers.\nBut those moments only set the scene for a stunning second quarter.\nPickett charged forward to receive a handball from Harrison Petty to boot his second major from the goal square.

His efforts made Melbourne a totally different team to the one that went into the game with an 0-5 record.\nTheir inability to score disappeared.\nFremantle are known as a strong defensive unit but the Demons kicked too many easy goals. Kade Chandler even dribbled a goal through from outside 50 after the kick dropped short. No Docker defender managed to stop it.\nFremantle had to work hard for their goals. Bolton kicked two in the first half through class, and then used his brilliance to give Jeremy Sharp the chance to boot another from near the boundary line.\nThey got another major from a down field free kick and weren't able to move the ball with freedom.\nMelbourne led the inside 50 count 32-24 at half-time as they led by 21 points. The Demons' desperation was summed up by them having 11 tackles inside 50 to Fremantle's one. Max Gawn was giving them amazing service in the ruck and Fremantle was constantly under pressure.\nPickett threatened to blow the game open again at the start of the third term but he missed his first shot and then a pass to Charlie Spargo didn't result in a score.\nFremantle then took the ball down the other end and kicked a goal through Oscar McDonald and it was only a 16-point game.\nYet Pickett remained the threat the Dockers couldn't stop. Every time he got near the ball, he looked ready to do something special.\nWhen Josh Draper was stuck one-on-one inside 50, Pickett marked, charged to the goalsquare, held up a peace sign to his opponent and drilled his fifth.\nFremantle needed a spark and Bolton was the man. Just like Pickett, his ability to play midfield and forward while turning nothing into something was influential.\nBolton's dancing feet created space, his brilliant mind saw opportunity when it felt like none existed and his skills allowed him to make things happen.\nThe Dockers were close enough if they were good enough when Isaiah Dudley goaled deep in time-on. But Melbourne received a free kick with just seconds remaining in the third term, Harry Petty kicked his fourth and the home team led by 19 points.\nCould Fremantle fight back? It looked ugly when Gawn received an early free kick directly in front of goal. He missed.\nDockers fans would have been fuming when Josh Treacy wasn't paid a mark or free kick about 30m from goal denying them a shot. But Treacy then missed with a set shot moments later.\nThey had another chance when Jye Amiss had the ball in the goalsquare but Trent Rivers made a desperate lunge to force an error.\nBut Bolton did as he'd done all day and created another opportunity for Amiss and he kicked truly. When Amiss kicked another goal from the boundary line, Fremantle trailed by just six points with seven minutes remaining.\nIt was game on. But just as they'd done all day, Melbourne had the answers. Harvey Langford kicked the next goal, the Demons kept the ball forward for an extended period and that ended the Fremantle challenge.\nSign up for our emails\nFind out More\n(c) West Australian Newspapers Limited 2025",
      "ml_hf_summary": "Melbourne defeated Fremantle 16.11 (107) to 14.13 (97) in a thrilling AFL match at the MCG. Kysaiah Pickett, who has expressed interest in playing for the Dockers, dominated the game with five goals and 24 disposals, significantly impacting the outcome of the match.  Melbourne's high-scoring performance was fueled by Pickett's exceptional playmaking abilities, while Fremantle struggled to find their rhythm despite some individual efforts from players like Shai Bolton and Oscar McDonald. The Demons led throughout the game, with Max Gawn providing crucial service in the ruck, and ultimately secured a 19-point victory.  The loss for Fremantle ended their three-game winning streak and significantly impacted their chances of securing Pickett's services at the end of the season. \n"

top desk drawer, a small plastic resealable bag containing a white powdery residue, a rolled-up $20 banknote, Qantas card with white powdery residue on it, rolled-up foreign currency, a rolled-up USD$1 banknote, rolled up $5 banknote, and a hand-rolled cigarette containing suspected cannabis,\" the document states.\n\"In the second drawer, police seized an Apple laptop.\n\"In the fireplace in the main living area, police seized 5 small plastic resealable bags containing a white powdery residue and two rolled up $5 banknotes.\"\nThis week, Mr Zubic told The Advertiser he believed he had been taken advantage of by Speirs as a recovering drug addict.\nThe case sent shockwaves through South Australian politics, with Premier Peter Malinauskas describing it as \"all a bit breathtaking\".\nThe offending took place during the final days of Speirs' period as opposition leader.\nSpeirs initially denied the veracity of the footage, claiming it was a \"deep-fake\", and denied ever having used drugs.\nBut he pleaded guilty last month to the supply charges and fronted Adelaide Magistrates Court on April 11 for sentencing submissions.\nSpeirs sat quietly in the dock throughout proceedings, as Director of Public Prosecutions Martin Hinton KC and defence lawyer William Mickan argued before Magistrate Brian Nitschke over an appropriate punishment.\nMr Mickan said his client had started using cocaine to \"escape\" the stresses of his high-level job as opposition leader to Mr Malinauskas.\nMr Mickan argued Speirs' drug use and supply was \"aberrant\" behaviour not in keeping with his long record of community and public service and had mushroomed as a result of the mental health impacts from his job.\nSpeirs \"experienced acute and immense stress as a result of becoming leader in the wake of the (2022) election loss,\" Mr Mickan said, and he \"felt extreme pressure to keep the (Liberal) party on track\".\n\"His mental health suffered. He didn't have a means to deal with it appropriately,\" he said.\nMr Mickan said Speirs used cocaine on several occasions as a \"maladaptive coping mechanism\".\nMr Hinton asked Mr Nitschke to impose a conviction on Speirs, arguing his former position as a parliamentarian and former minister warranted stern denunciation from the courts.\n\"You cannot put yourself up for public office, accept public office, hold public office and then expect you will not be held to the standards that go with public office,\" he said.\nMr Hinton said although Speirs' offending was on the lower end of drug supply offending, he nonetheless had perpetuated drug trafficking.\nMr Mickan invited Mr Nitschke not to record a conviction against Speirs and consider instead a good behaviour bond.\nThe maximum penalty for the offence is a $50,000 fine or a 10-year jail term. Mr Nitschke will deliver his sentence on April 24.\nMr Speirs, who speaks with a Scottish accent and immigrated to Australia as a teenager, resigned from parliament in the wake of the video.\nOriginally published as Police release fresh details into former SA Liberal leader David James Speirs' drug supply offending\nSign up for our emails\nFind out More\n(c) West Australian Newspapers Limited 2025",

The American Civil Liberties Union, which represented the plaintiffs, had no immediate comment.\nThe case is one of several nationally that were filed related to an executive order Trump signed after returning to office on January 20 directing the government to recognise only two biologically distinct sexes, male and female.\nThe order also directed the State Department to change its policies to only issue passports that \"accurately reflect the holder's sex\".\nThe State Department soon after changed its passport policy to \"request the applicant's biological sex at birth,\" rather than permitting applicants to self-identify their sex, and to only allow them to be listed as male or female.\nKobick, an appointee of Trump's Democratic predecessor Joe Biden, said the policy reflected a reversal of more than 30 years of practice at the State Department of allowing people to update the sex designation on their passports.\nIn 2022, the Biden administration allowed passport applicants to choose \"X\" as a neutral sex marker on their passport applications, as well as being able to self-select \"M\" or \"F\" for male or female.\nSign up for our emails\nFind out More\n(c) West Australian Newspapers Limited 2025",

The judge ruled that the policy discriminated based on sex and violated equal protection principles outlined in the Fifth Amendment.

Let's help make sure you're in good spirits by keeping your Wordle streak trundling along. In case you need some assistance with that, here's our daily Wordle guide with some hints and the answer for Saturday's puzzle (#1,400).\nIt may be that you're a Wordle newcomer and you're not completely sure how to play the game. We're here to help with that too.\nWordle is a deceptively simple daily word game that first emerged in 2021. The gist is that there is one five-letter word to deduce every day by process of elimination. The daily word is the same for everyone.\nWordle blew up in popularity in late 2021 after creator Josh Wardle made it easy for players to share an emoji-based grid with their friends and followers that detailed how they fared each day. The game's success spurred dozens of clones across a swathe of categories and formats.\nThe New York Times purchased Wordle in early 2022 for an undisclosed sum. The publication said that players collectively played Wordle 5.3 billion times in 2024. So, it's little surprise that Wordle is one of the best online games and puzzles you can play daily.\nTo start playing Wordle, you simply need to enter one five-letter word. The game will tell you how close you are to that day's secret word by highlighting letters that are in the correct position in green. Letters that appear in the word but aren't in the right spot will be highlighted in yellow. If you guess any letters that are not in the secret word, the game will gray those out on the virtual keyboard.\nYou'll only have six guesses to find each day's word, though you still can use grayed-out letters to help narrow things down. It's also worth remembering that letters can appear in the secret word more than once.\nWordle is free to play on the NYT's website and apps, as well as on Meta Quest headsets. The game refreshes at midnight local time. If you log into a New York Times account, you can track your stats, including the all-important win streak.\nIf you have a NYT subscription that includes full access to the publication's games, you don't have to stop after a single round of Wordle. You'll have access to an archive of more than 1,300 previous Wordle games. So if you're a relative newcomer, you'll be able to go back and catch up on previous editions.\nIn addition, paid NYT Games members have access to a tool called the Wordle Bot. This can tell you how well you performed at each day's game.\nBefore today's Wordle hints, here are the answers to recent puzzles that you may have missed:\nYesterday's Wordle answer for Friday, April 18 -- DIRGE\nThursday, April 17 -- STOOD\nWednesday, April 16 -- MORAL\nTuesday, April 15 -- ASHEN\nMonday, April 14 -- CREST\nEvery day, we'll try to make Wordle a little easier for you. First, we'll offer a hint that describes the meaning of the word or how it might be used in a phrase or sentence. We'll also tell you if there are any double (or even triple) letters in the word.\nIn case you still haven't quite figured it out by that point, we'll then provide the first letter of the word. Those who are still stumped after that can continue on to find out the answer for today's Wordle.\nThis should go without saying, but make sure to scroll slowly. Spoilers are ahead.\nHere is a hint for today's Wordle answer:\nWhere emails you actually might want to read go.\nThere are no repeated letters in today's Wordle answer.\nThe first letter of today's Wordle answer is I.\nThis is your final warning before we reveal today's Wordle answer. No take-backs.\nDon't blame us if you happen to scroll too far and accidentally spoil the game for yourself.\nWhat is today's Wordle? Today's Wordle answer is...\nINBOX\nNot to worry if you didn't figure out today's Wordle word. If you made it this far down the page, hopefully you at least kept your streak going. And, hey: there's always another game tomorrow.\nAudio\nComputing\nGaming\nPhones\nScience\nHome Entertainment\nStreaming\nVPN\nWearables\nDeals\nAdvertise\nAbout our ads\nCareers\nHelp\nFeedback\nFollow us on\n(c) 2025 Yahoo.

In light of what Republicans have done since they took power a couple months ago, it may be more of a \"pot calling the kettle black\" situation, but that doesn't mean your criticisms aren't fair. And yet, as much as Trump says he dislikes China, his tariff obsession isn't just isolating the United States. It's pushing other countries to work more closely with China and, most importantly for our interests here, buy more of their electric cars.\nYou've probably heard by now that Chinese EVs are better than the ones we have here in the U.S., and you may have seen a few photos, but it's hard to really understand how far China's auto industry has come without getting on a plane and going to see them in person. That's a long, expensive flight, even if you didn't have to worry about whether you'd be disappeared trying to re-enter the country, but don't worry. We've got you. Or at least our friends at InsideEVs do.\nThey recently put together a video from their most recent trips to China to drive some of its EVs, and when you look at the best China has to offer versus what we have here, it's clear we're behind, as is the rest of the Western world.\nRead more: These Are The Worst American Cars Ever Made\nIt isn't just the cars themselves, either. It's the infrastructure, too. Remember back in 2013, when we saw Tesla perform a battery swap on a Model S in 90 seconds? That was pretty neat, but Musk also immediately abandoned the idea. Well, China's Nio actually put the idea into practice, and while it takes a little longer than 90 seconds to grab a new, fully charged battery when the CEO isn't just scamming the government for EV credits, the five-minute wait time is still fast enough that you probably won't even feel the need to get out of the car unless you really need to pee.\nAnd if you don't like the idea of owning a car but not the battery, they're also ahead on charging tech. The Zeekr 007 may not be the prettiest car ever made, but it costs about the same as a Tesla Model 3 and can charge to 80% in 10 minutes. Subsidized or not, as Chinese EVs enter more markets, it's going to be hard to convince regular people to skip the one sold by a Chinese company for a slower-charging, slower car that may even be more expensive. It isn't just Europe, either. Japan and Korea just agreed to work with China more closely, Chinese EV companies are already popular in Mexico, and there's even a chance Canada could soon lift its 100% tariff on Chinese EVs, as well.\nThat isn't exactly great news, but now that we've chosen to isolate ourselves from the rest of the world, all we can really do is watch while Chinese EVs take over, the rest of the world advances, and the country that used to be the world's leader for innovation becomes a technological backwater.\nWant more like this?

Mass production is expected for the second half of the year, and TSMC promises it will represent a major step forward in performance and efficiency -- potentially reshaping the technological landscape.\nMicrochips are the foundation of modern technology, found in nearly all electronic devices, from electric toothbrushes and smartphones to laptops and household appliances. They are made by layering and etching materials like silicon to create microscopic circuits containing billions of transistors.\nThese transistors are effectively tiny switches, managing the flow of electricity and allowing computers to work. In general, the more transistors a chip contains, the faster and more powerful it becomes.\nThe microchip industry consistently endeavors to pack more transistors into a smaller area, leading to faster, more powerful, and energy efficient technological devices.\nCompared to the previous most advanced chip, known as 3nm chips, TSMC's 2nm technology should deliver notable benefits. These include a 10%-15% boost in computing speed at the same power level or a 20-30% reduction in power usage at the same speed.\nAdditionally, transistor density in 2nm chips is increased by about 15%, over and above the 3nm technology. This should enable devices to operate faster, consume less energy, and manage more complex tasks efficiently.\nTaiwan's microchip industry is closely tied into its security. It is sometimes referred to as the \"silicon shield\", because its widespread economic importance incentivises the US and allies to defend Taiwan against the possibility of Chinese invasion.\nRelated: China's new 2D transistor could soon be used to make the world's fastest processors\nTSMC recently struck a US$100 billion deal (PS76 billion) to build five new US factories. However, there is uncertainty over whether the 2nm chips can be manufactured outside Taiwan, as some officials are concerned that could undermine the island's security.\nEstablished in 1987, TSMC, which stands for Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, manufactures chips for other companies. Taiwan accounts for 60% of the global \"foundry\" market (the outsourcing of semiconductor manufacturing) and the vast majority of that comes from TSMC alone.\nTSMC's super-advanced microchips are used by other companies in a wide range of devices. It manufactures Apple's A-series processors used in iPhones, iPads, and Macs, it produces NVidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) used for machine learning and AI applications. It also makes AMD's Ryzen and EPYC processors used by supercomputers worldwide, and it produces Qualcomm's Snapdragon processors, used by Samsung, Xiaomi, OnePlus, and Google phones.\nIn 2020, TSMC started a special microchip miniaturization process, called 5nm FinFET technology, that played a crucial role in smartphone and high-performance computing (HPC) development. HPC is the practice of getting multiple processors to work simultaneously on complex computing problems.\nTwo years later, TSMC launched a 3nm miniaturization process based on even smaller microchips. This further enhanced performance and power efficiency. Apple's A-series processor, for example, is based on this technology.\nSmartphones, laptops and tablets with 2nm chips could benefit from better performance and longer battery life. This will lead to smaller, lighter devices without sacrificing power.\nThe efficiency and speed of 2nm chips has the potential to enhance AI-based applications such as voice assistants, real time language translation, and autonomous computer systems (those designed to work with minimal to no human input). Data centers could experience reduced energy consumption and improved processing capabilities, contributing to environmental sustainability goals.\nSectors like autonomous vehicles and robotics could benefit from the increased processing speed and reliability of the new chips, making these technologies safer and more practical for widespread adoption.\nThis all sounds really promising, but while 2nm chips represent a technological milestone, they also pose challenges. The first one is related to the manufacturing complexity.\nProducing 2nm chips requires cutting-edge techniques like extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography. This complex and expensive process increases production costs and demands extremely high precision.\nRELATED STORIES\n--AI-designed chips are so weird that 'humans cannot really understand them' -- but they perform better than anything we've created\n--Light-powered computer chip can train AI much faster than components powered by electricity\n--Tiny AI chip modeled on the human brain set to boost battery life in smart devices\nAnother big issue is heat. Even with relatively lower consumption, as transistors shrink and densities increase, managing heat dissipation becomes a critical challenge.\nOverheating can impact chip performance and durability. In addition, at such a small scale, traditional materials like silicon may reach their performance limits, requiring the exploration of different materials.\nThat said, the enhanced computational power, energy efficiency, and miniaturization enabled by these chips could be a gateway to a new era of consumer and industrial computing. Smaller chips could lead to breakthroughs in tomorrow's technology, creating devices that are not only powerful but also discreet and more environmentally friendly.\nThis edited article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.
