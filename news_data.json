      "content": "Watch CBS News \n Updated on: April 3, 2025 / 9:46 AM EDT\n / CBS News \n Miller Gardner, the youngest son of former New York Yankees outfielder Brett Gardner, died on March 21 at the age of 14 while on vacation with his family in Costa Rica.\nCarbon monoxide poisoning was the cause of death, authorities in Costa Rica confirmed on April 2. High levels of the toxic gas had been detected in testing of the family's hotel room.\nHere is what we know about Miller Gardner's death.\nMiller Gardner's parents said in a statement that he died in his sleep after he and several other family members fell ill while vacationing. They did not elaborate on who else had gotten sick, what specific illness they were dealing with or what symptoms they had experienced.\nThe Gardners were vacationing at the Arenas Del Mar Beachfront & Rainforest Resort, which is along Costa Rica's Pacific coast, some 50 miles south of San Jose.\n\"We are deeply saddened by this loss, and our hearts go out to the family during this incredibly difficult time,\" the resort said in a statement on Tuesday, March 25. \"The factors that led to this tragic incident are unknown, and we are fully cooperating with authorities as they investigate. We remain committed to supporting our guests and staff, prioritizing their well-being and safety, while respecting the privacy of those affected.\"\nThe resort also told CBS News that hotel staff responded to the incident according to protocol, saying: \"The hotel staff dispatched a medical team immediately, including a licensed doctor, which arrived to handle the emergency situation. Any medical attention to the family was done by medical professionals. Our staff did not administer any medical treatment.\"\nRandall Zuniga, director of the Judicial Investigation Agency, or OIJ, said on March 31 that investigators conducted testing in the hotel room where Gardner was staying and found high levels of carbon monoxide, which he said may have been caused by machinery in the room next door. The contamination they found led investigators to believe Gardner \"may have died from inhaling these highly dangerous gases,\" Zuniga said.\nThe cause of death was confirmed after Gardner was tested for carboxyhemoglobin, a compound generated when carbon monoxide binds to hemoglobin in the blood, according to Zuniga. The test showed a carboxyhemoglobin saturation of 64%. Saturation is considered lethal when it exceeds 50%.\nThe head of Costa Rica's judicial police also said that a \"layer\" was detected during the autopsy on Gardner's organs. That layer forms due to a high presence of carbon monoxide.\nCarbon monoxide is an odorless gas produced by the burning of fossil fuels in equipment such as cars, furnaces, stoves, certain heaters and generators. Symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning may include headache, dizziness, nausea, vomiting and confusion.\nZuniga said the investigation was \"closely coordinated\" with the FBI.\nThe hotel told CBS News in a statement on March 31 that it was \"diligently cooperating with the Costa Rican judicial authorities, who have taken over the investigation.\"\n\"We trust that the forensic process will objectively, clearly, and conclusively clarify the causes of this unfortunate incident,\" the hotel said.\nThe OIJ director had said it was conducting three types of analyses, including a toxicology report, at its forensic science laboratories.\nAsphyxiation was initially thought to be the cause of death, although that theory was ruled out after an autopsy performed by the Forensic Pathology Section. An initial statement had said: \"Preliminary reports indicate the cause of death is asphyxiation following possible food poisoning.\" \nSome news outlets quoted a local official who cited possible \"food intoxication,\" but there is no condition by that name, and it appears in this context to have meant the same thing as food poisoning. \nFollowing the reports of possible food poisoning, Hotel La Mariposa, located less than a mile from where the Gardners were staying, released a statement to address what it called \"misinformation circulating on social media.\"\n\"The Gardner family dined at our restaurant, Le Papillon, on the afternoon of Tuesday, March 18, 2025--three days before Miller's tragic passing. Any claims suggesting a link between our restaurant and this heartbreaking event are entirely false and unfounded,\" the restaurant said. \"Any news, statements, or claims to the contrary do not reflect the reality of the situation. Furthermore, we do not have any additional information, as the Gardner family did not stay at our hotel.\" The hotel also extended its \"heartfelt condolences to the Gardner family.\"\nThe Arenas Del Mar resort, where the Gardners were staying, said in a statement, \"The family did not eat at any of Arenas Del Mar's restaurants for lunch or dinner the previous day. Additionally, on March 14th, we had an inspection by the Health Ministry in which the hotel passed with a 98.5 out of 100.\"\nIn a statement before the cause of death was confirmed, Miller Gardner's parents, Brett and Jessica Gardner, said they had \"so many questions and so few answers.\"\n\"Miller was a beloved son and brother and we cannot yet comprehend our life without his infectious smile,\" they said. \"He loved football, baseball, golf, hunting, fishing, his family and his friends. He lived life to the fullest every single day.\"\n\"We are so thankful to all who have reached out to offer support and encouragement during this difficult time and we are confident our faith, family, and friends will help us navigate this unimaginable loss,\" their statement continued. \"Our prayers go out to Miller's teammates and friends, as well as to all other families who have lost a child far too soon as we share their grief.\"\nAn obituary posted online described Miller Gardner as an Honor Roll student who played football and baseball and loved traveling with his family.\n\"The void Miller's passing leaves in the hearts of his family, friends, teammates, teachers, coaches and others will be felt for years,\" it said. \"Miller's time here with them was brief but his spirit will carry on forever through those who were impacted by the way he lived.\" \nThe New York Yankees, where Brett Gardner played for 14 years, released the following statement after news of Miller Gardner's death became public.\n\"Our hearts are heavy, and the Yankees family is filled with grief after learning of the passing of Miller Gardner. Words feel insignificant and insufficient in trying to describe such an unimaginable loss. It wasn't just Brett who literally grew up in this organization for more than 17 years -- so did his wife, Jessica, and their two boys, Hunter and Miller. \nWe grieve with Brett, Jessica, Hunter, and their community of family and friends in mourning the loss of Miller, who had a spark in his eyes, an outgoing and feisty personality, and a warm and loving nature.\nOur love for the Gardner family is unconditional and absolute, and we will offer our enduring support while understanding their desire for privacy at this time.\nMay Miller rest in peace.\"\nBrett Gardner is a former baseball player who spent his entire professional career with the New York Yankees. Originally from North Carolina, he was initially drafted by the Yankees in 2005 and was first called up in 2008 before becoming a regular starter the following season. During his 14 MLB seasons, the outfielder won one World Series in 2009, earned an All-Star appearance in 2015 and a Gold Glove Award in 2016.\nAs a rookie, Gardner scored the final run in the old Yankee Stadium in 2008, which was replaced the following year.\nHis final season was in 2021. \n The Associated Press \n contributed to this report.\n \n Jordan Freiman is a news editor for CBSNews.com.

      "content": "Judge describes deportation of Maryland resident Kilmar Abrego Garcia as an 'illegal act'.\nA federal judge has ordered the administration of President Donald Trump to return a man to the United States after he was wrongly deported to El Salvador.\nBefore issuing the ruling on Friday, Judge Paula Xinis called Kilmar Abrego Garcia's deportation \"an illegal act\" and condemned Trump administration lawyers for lacking answers to fundamental questions surrounding the incident.\nAbrego Garcia, 29, had been put on a deportation flight to El Salvador in March, despite an immigration judge's 2019 ruling that shielded him from expulsion in light of likely persecution by local gangs in his home country.\n\"His continued presence in El Salvador, for obvious reasons, constitutes irreparable harm,\" the judge said in her order to the Department of Homeland Security and other agencies.\nDespite immigration officials and even the White House acknowledging that Abrego Garcia had been deported in \"error\", Trump officials have been defiant in their response.\nWhite House spokesperson Karline Leavitt earlier this week insisted the Maryland resident was a member of the MS-13 gang, citing unreleased evidence.\n\"The administration maintains the position that this individual, who was deported to El Salvador and will not be returning to our country, was a member of the brutal and vicious MS-13 gang,\" Leavitt said. \n Abrego Garcia's lawyers have said there is no evidence their client was in MS-13, saying the allegation is based on a confidential informant's claim in 2019. The informant claimed Abrego Garcia was a member of the gang's chapter in New York, where he has never lived.\nDuring the hearing on Friday, Justice Department lawyer Erez Reuveni could not tell the judge under what authority Abrego Garcia, who was legally authorised to work in the US, had been taken into custody before his expulsion.\n\"I'm also frustrated that I have no answers for you for a lot of these questions,\" he said.\nMeanwhile, Abrego Garcia's lawyer, Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, took aim at the Trump administration's inaction.\n\"Plenty of tweets. Plenty of White House press conferences. But no actual steps taken with the government of El Salvador to make it right,\" he said.\n\"An apology would be nice, but I'm not expecting that,\" he added.\nAt a rally at a community centre in nearby Hyattsville, Maryland, Abrego Garcia's wife said she had not spoken to her husband since he was flown to El Salvador.\nJennifer Vasquez Sura, who is a US citizen, urged supporters to keep fighting for her husband \"and all the Kilmars out there whose stories are still waiting to be heard\".\n\"To all the wives, mothers, children who also face this cruel separation, I stand with you in this bond of pain,\" she said\nThe debacle comes as the Trump administration has sought to make good on a campaign pledge to surge deportations, with Trump framing undocumented migration in the US as an \"invasion\".\nAuthorities have increased arrests, but expulsions have been more difficult, with most cases slowly making their way through backlogged immigration courts. \n In March, the administration sought to fast-track the process by invoking the 1789 Alien Enemies Act, which allows for the expulsion of foreign nationals during wartime.\nRights groups say the law denies individuals due process, with a court filing indicating some of the 237 men deported under the law, alongside Abrego Garcia, were targeted solely for having tattoos or clothing believed to be associated with Latin American gangs.\nA judge has temporarily barred Trump from using the law for deportations.\nHe has been determining whether the administration violated his March 15 order by refusing to turn around two deportation flights, one of which carried Abrego Garcia, already in the air at the time. \n Follow Al Jazeera English:",

      "content": "Watch CBS News \n Updated on: April 2, 2025 / 8:32 PM EDT\n / CBS News \n Washington -- The U.S. citizen wife of a 29-year-old man who the Trump administration has admitted was mistakenly deported to El Salvador said she fears for his safety in the infamous mega-prison where he's being held, maintaining that her husband is \"an amazing father\" and \"not a criminal.\"\nKilmar Abrego Garcia was deported to El Salvador on March 15 and imprisoned inside that country's maximum-security prison known as CECOT, as part of a series of U.S. deportation flights that have ignited a high-stakes legal battle in American courts. \nThe Trump administration has acknowledged in federal court that his deportation was an \"administrative error,\" since an immigration judge in 2019 had granted him legal protection from being sent to El Salvador. But it has rejected requests to bring back Abrego Garcia, saying the U.S. no longer has custody over him. It is also accusing him of being part of MS-13, a transnational criminal gang. Abrego Garcia's lawyers have said in court documents that their client has no criminal record, a finding the government has not contested.\nDuring an exclusive interview with CBS News, Jennifer, Abrego Garcia's wife, said she confirmed her husband had been deported from the U.S. and imprisoned at the CECOT prison after identifying him in a photo posted by the Salvadoran government.\n\"When I saw it, I immediately broke down 'cause I knew it was him,\" she said. \"I was scared for his life.\"\nJennifer, who requested that her surname be withheld, said she was \"very scared\" about Abrego Garcia's transfer to CECOT because it houses some of El Salvador's most dangerous gang members. After all, she said, the reason a U.S. immigration judge in 2019 granted him a reprieve from deportation was because of concerns that he could be persecuted by gangs in El Salvador.\n\"I've seen news of that prison,\" she said. \"I know they take criminals there. And my husband's not a criminal.\"\nAbrego Garcia came to the U.S. in 2011, when he was 16. According to court documents, he entered the country illegally, without being inspected by immigration officials.\nIn 2019, Abrego Garcia was arrested by Immigration and Customs Enforcement after an encounter with local police outside of a Maryland Home Depot. Abrego Garcia's attorneys said he went there looking for work. He remained in ICE detention for months, while an immigration judge reviewed his case.\nCourt documents show an immigration judge initially denied Abrego Garcia's release on bond, partially due to information submitted by the government that it said tied him to MS-13. The judge's bond denial, which was upheld by an immigration appeals board, mentioned information from an informant who the government deemed to be credible.\nBut Abrego Garcia was ultimately released from ICE custody after another immigration judge granted him \"withholding of removal,\" a legal classification that bars officials from deporting individuals who prove they are more likely than not to face persecution in their home country. In his order, the judge said Abrego Garcia could be targeted by gangs if sent to El Salvador.\nJennifer said her husband attended regular check-ins with ICE after he was released. He became their family's main breadwinner, she added, and helped her raise their 5-year-old disabled son, as well as two children from a previous relationship. He worked five days a week as a sheet metal worker while also attending college classes, she said.\nOn March 12, however, Abrego Garcia was again arrested by ICE. Jennifer said he was driving with their 5-year-old son with disabilities when he was stopped. She said she rushed to the location and was told by ICE officials that her husband's status had \"changed\" and that he would be fingerprinted and detained.\nOver the next few days, Jennifer said her husband was transferred to different immigration detention centers, including ones in Louisiana and Texas. During their last phone call, Jennifer said Abrego Garcia told her that he was going to be deported to El Salvador and imprisoned at CECOT.\nJennifer said she couldn't believe it. She told her husband there was no reason for the U.S. to send him to a foreign prison. He said that if she didn't receive another call from him, it would be because he had been deported.\n\"He never called,\" Jennifer said. \"I waited and waited. He never made that call.\"\nJennifer said she has not heard from her husband since that call and has not found a way to communicate with him. She's now suing the government as part of a lawsuit before the federal district court in Maryland that is demanding that the U.S. government take steps to bring Abrego Garcia back to the country.\nWhile it has conceded it mistakenly deported Abrego Garcia, the Trump administration has defended the merits of his deportation and has told the federal court in Maryland it opposes his return to the U.S.\nThe Justice Department has argued that federal courts lack the authority to facilitate Abrego Garcia's return, since he's now being held by the Salvadoran government and no longer in U.S. custody. Even if they did have the power to order his return, the Justice Department said in a filing, there has been \"no showing that El Salvador is even inclined to consider a request to release a detainee at the United States' request.\"\nTrump administration officials, including White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt, have described Abrego Garcia as an MS-13 \"leader\" who is implicated in human trafficking. Officials have yet to disclose concrete evidence that supports those claims.\nJennifer strongly refuted the White House's accusations, saying she would know if her husband was a gang member. Court documents indicate Abrego Garcia has traffic violations, but no criminal charges or convictions, in the U.S.\n\"He's not a criminal,\" Jennifer said. \"My husband is an amazing person. An amazing father.\"\nCamilo Montoya-Galvez is the immigration reporter at CBS News. Based in Washington, he covers immigration policy and politics. \n (c) 2025 CBS Interactive Inc.

      "content": "Watch CBS News \n Updated on: April 4, 2025 / 1:12 PM EDT\n / CBS News \n An African giant pouched rat is being honored in the record books after detecting more than 100 landmines and other undetonated explosives in Cambodia, Belgian non-profit APOPO announced Friday. \nThe rat, named Ronin, was named APOPO's most successful Mine Detection Rat. He also was acknowledged by the Guinness World Records. \nSince August 2021, Ronin has detected 109 landmines and 15 items of unexploded ordnance, APOPO said. The record-smashing rodent is expected to do another two years or more of detection work, the non-profit said.\n\"Ronin's achievements are a testament to the incredible potential of positive reinforcement training. He's not just an asset; he's a valued partner and colleague,\" said Phanny, Ronin's handler, in a news release from APOPO. \nThe previous record was held by the African giant pouched rat Magawa, who detected 71 landmines and 38 pieces of unexploded ordnance over the course of five years. \nAPOPO has been training mine-detecting rats for over 25 years. Ronin underwent clicker training, where the rat learns to associate the sound of a click with a treat, to motivate him to learn how to smell explosives. He was also trained to work systemically within a grid pattern and to indicate landmines by scratching at the ground. Ronin and rats like him work for about 30 minutes a day, APOPO said. When they reach a certain age, they are moved to a retirement community and remain under APOPO's care. Magawa, the previous record-holder, was retired in 2021 and died in 2022.\nUndetonated landmines and ordnance are a huge problem in Cambodia. Decades of conflict have left up to six million unexploded munitions in the country's soil, according to the Landmine Monitor's 2024 report. Since 1979, those buried bombs have caused about 20,000 deaths and 45,000 injuries, the Landmine Monitor reported. Demining efforts have been underway for decades, including the work done by Ronin and other APOPO rats. In 2023, there were only 32 reported casualties involving landmines in Cambodia, according to the Landmine Monitor. The site does not distinguish between injuries and deaths when referring to casualties. \nThe APOPO's efforts are not limited to Cambodia. The non-profit estimates that about 110 million landmines are buried across 60 countries. In 2023, 1,431 deaths were connected to these landmines. The agency said it continues to work to remove landmines and unexploded ordnance from the world. \n\"When we launched APOPO, the common view was that it would take around 500 years to clear all landmines from the Earth's surface,\" said Christine Cox, the CEO of APOPO. \"25 years later, there is light at the end of the tunnel, and if the international community fully supports the collaboration of all demining operators, we could clear the remaining minefields in our lifetime.\" \nKerry Breen is a news editor at CBSNews.com.

      "content": "Watch CBS News \n Updated on: April 4, 2025 / 12:51 PM EDT\n / CBS/AFP \n Maseru, Lesotho -- President Trump in March described Lesotho as a place \"nobody has ever heard of,\" and then this week he hit the tiny African kingdom with the highest of his \"reciprocal\" trade tariffs for any single nation. \nMr. Trump's so-called \"Liberation Day\" tariffs included a whopping 50% levy on the small, impoverished nation's imports, and the Lesotho government quickly said it would send a delegation to Washington. \n \"We need to urgently travel to the U.S. to engage with its executives and plead our case,\" Trade Minister Mokhethi Shelile told reporters Thursday. \"My biggest concern was the immediate closure of factories and job losses.\"\n Lesotho's annual gross domestic product of $2 billion is highly reliant on exports, mostly of textiles, including jeans.\n \"There are 11 factories in the country, most of which export goods to the U.S. and provide employment to 12,000 workers,\" Shelile said. \"Goods currently in production will be affected by these tariffs and will not be exported to the U.S.\"\nHe said he'd asked factories to continue operating \"while we work on solutions,\" and added that the U.S. action showed his country needed to \"diversify\" its trade relationships, which he said it had already started exploring.\n\"We cannot rely solely on the U.S.,\" he said. \"While this transition will take time, the process is already underway.\"\nTo determine the rates of its new tariffs, the White House used a formula to calculate the sum of all the trade practices it deems unfair from other nations, including currency manipulation, tariffs and other barriers. Economists have questioned the methodology, and many foreign governments have complained the levies are unfair and misrepresent their trade imbalances with the U.S.\nThe White House claims, by way of that formula, that Lesotho imposes 99% tariffs and other barriers on U.S. imports.\nBelow is a look at the small kingdom, sometimes called \"the Switzerland of Africa\" thanks to its mountainous landscape. It took a bigger tariff hit from the White House this week than any other country.\nCompletely surrounded by South Africa, Lesotho is the largest of only three enclaved states in the world, but it is far bigger than San Marino or Vatican City, both of which are within Italy's borders.\n At about 11,720 square miles, it is about the same size as Belgium but has a population of roughly 2.3 million, compared to Belgium's nearly 12 million.\nLesotho is known for the beauty of its mountainous terrain and styles itself the \"Kingdom in the Sky.\"\n More than 80% of the country sits 5,900 feet above sea level and it is home to southern Africa's only ski resort. Its highest peak is Mount Thabana Ntlenyana, with an altitude of 11,424 feet.\n A constitutional monarchy like Britain, it is ruled by 61-year-old King Letsie III, who has no formal power. The government is led by a prime minister selected through national parliamentary elections.\nWith an annual gross domestic product of just over $2 billion, Lesotho is largely dependent on South Africa -- it biggest trading partner -- from which it imports most of its food, selling water in return.\n The economy has been heavily reliant on textile exports bound for the United States through the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) trade deal, which provides duty-free access to the U.S. market for some African products. The Trump administration's imposition of tariffs on African nations has raised questions over how likely the White House is to renew the AGOA pact when it expires in September.\n Its traditional Basotho blankets are a national symbol and renowned for their vibrant patterns and woolen warmth. They are often loaded with meaning, from celebrating life and nationality, to fertility and royalty, peace, love and courage.\nLesotho ranks among the world's poorest countries despite huge mineral reserves. British mine company Gem Diamonds said in 2018 that it had discovered a 910-carat stone in one of its several Lesotho diamond mines.\n The country also pioneered the growing of cannabis for medical use in Africa.\n Unemployment has remained stubbornly high, hitting nearly 25% in 2023, according to the World Bank.\n\"Poverty and inequality remain significant challenges,\" the World Bank says. \"Despite efforts to improve living standards, a significant portion of Lesotho's population lives below the poverty line, with rural areas being particularly affected. Access to basic services such as healthcare, education, and clean water remains limited, contributing to poor health outcomes and educational attainment. High rates of HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis further strain the healthcare system, reducing the workforce and increasing the dependency ratio.\"\nA charity co-founded by Prince Harry in Lesotho to help people living with HIV ran into turbulence this month after a bitter boardroom row led King Charles III's younger son to step down as patron.\n Its Zimbabwe-born chairperson, Sophie Chandauka, publicly accused the prince of \"bullying\" and being involved in a \"cover up,\" accusations the former royal has dismissed as lies.\n Harry founded the charity in 2006 with Prince Seeiso of Lesotho, before it expanded to Botswana.\nThe charity's name, Sentebale, is a tribute to his mother, Princess Diana, who died in a Paris car crash in 1997 when he was just 12.\nAt least one in four adults in Lesotho is infected with HIV, one of the highest rates in the world. \nMore than 230,000 people were receiving anti-retroviral treatment in 2021, according to the World Health Organization.\n In 2020, the country achieved the UN's \"90-90-90\" goal of 90% of people with the virus being diagnosed, on treatment and achieving viral suppression.\n The country also has the second-highest incidence of Tuberculosis in the world, estimated at 724 cases per 100,000 people. \n (c) 2025 CBS Interactive Inc.

The incident occurred seven years after another American was killed by the tribe on the same island.\nMykhailo Viktorovych Polyakov, 24, set foot on the restricted territory of North Sentinel -- part of India's Andaman Islands -- in a bid to meet the Sentinelese people, who are believed to number only around 150.\nAll outsiders, Indians and foreigners alike, are banned from traveling within three miles of the island to protect the Indigenous people from outside diseases and to preserve their way of life.\n\"The American citizen was presented before the local court after his arrest and is now on a three-day remand for further interrogation,\" Andaman and Nicobar Islands police chief HGS Dhaliwal told AFP.\nSatellite photographs show a coral reef-fringed island -- stretching to some six miles at its widest point -- with thick forest and white sand beaches.\nThe Sentinelese last made international headlines in 2018 after they killed John Allen Chau, 27, an American missionary who landed illegally on their beach.\nChau's body was not recovered and there were no investigations over his death because of the Indian law prohibiting anyone from going to the island. Officials at the time said he was apparently shot and killed by arrows.\nIndia sees the wider Andaman and Nicobar Islands as strategically sited on key global shipping lanes. They are closer to Myanmar than mainland India.\nNew Delhi plans to invest at least $9 billion to expand naval and air bases, troop accommodations, the port and the main city in the region.\nDhaliwal said Polyakov kept blowing a whistle off the shore of North Sentinel Island for about an hour to attract the tribe's attention before he went ashore.\n\"He landed briefly for about five minutes, left the offerings on the shore, collected sand samples, and recorded a video before returning to his boat,\" Dhaliwal said. \"A review of his GoPro camera footage showed his entry and landing into the restricted North Sentinel Island.\"\nPolice said Polyakov was arrested late on Monday, about two days after he went ashore, and had visited the region twice in recent months.\nHe first used an inflatable kayak in October 2024 but was stopped by hotel staff, police said on Thursday. Polyakov made another unsuccessful attempt during a visit in January 2025.\nThis time Polyakov used another inflatable boat with a motor to travel the roughly 22 miles of open sea from the main archipelago.\nThe charity Survival International issued a statement, calling Polyakov's actions \"deeply disturbing/\"\n\"It beggars belief that someone could be that reckless and idiotic,\" the group's director, Carolina Pearce, said. \"This person's actions not only endangered his own life, they put the lives of the entire Sentinelese tribe at risk. It's very well known by now that uncontacted peoples have no immunity to common outside diseases like flu or measles, which could completely wipe them out.\"\nThe Sentinelese, whose language and customs remain a mystery to outsiders, shun all contact and have a record of hostility to anyone who tries to get close.\nA photograph issued by the Indian Coast Guard and Survival International two decades ago showed a Sentinelese man aiming a bow and arrow at a passing helicopter.\nIndian authorities have prosecuted any locals who have aided attempts to enter the island and are trying to identify anyone who may have helped Polyakov.\nThe Andamans are also home to the 400-strong Jarawa tribe, who activists say are also threatened by contact from outsiders. Tourists have previously bribed local officials in a bid to spend time with the Jarawa. \n (c) 2025 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

      "content": "Watch CBS News \n Updated on: April 4, 2025 / 8:52 AM EDT\n / AP \n Seoul, South Korea -- South Korea's Constitutional Court removed impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol from office Friday, ending his tumultuous presidency and setting up an election to find a new leader, four months after he threw South Korean politics into turmoil with an ill-fated declaration of martial law. \nThe unanimous verdict capped a dramatic fall for Yoon, a former star prosecutor who went from political novice to president in 2022, just a year after he entered politics. \nIn a nationally televised verdict, the court's acting chief Moon Hyung-bae said the eight-member bench upheld Yoon's impeachment because his martial law decree seriously violated the constitution and other laws. \n\"The defendant not only declared martial law, but also violated the constitution and laws by mobilizing military and police forces to obstruct the exercise of legislative authority,\" Moon said. \"Ultimately, the declaration of martial law in this case violated the substantive requirements for emergency martial law.\" \n\"Given the grave negative impact on constitutional order and the significant ripple effects of the defendant's violations, we find that the benefits of upholding the constitution by removing the defendant from office far outweigh the national losses from the removal of a president,\" the justice concluded. \nAt an anti-Yoon rally near the old royal palace that dominates downtown Seoul, people erupted into tears and danced when the verdict was announced. Two women wept as they hugged and an old man near them leapt to his feet and screamed with joy.\nThe crowd later began marching through Seoul streets. Some people were dressed in cute blue bear costumes, a protest mascot that uses the opposition's colors. \nOutside Yoon's official residence, thousands of supporters cried and screamed when they saw the news of the verdict on a giant TV screen. They waved South Korean and U.S. flags and chanted slogans. \n\"We will absolutely not be shaken!\" a protest leader shouted on stage. \"Anyone who accepts this ruling and prepares for an early presidential election is our enemy.\" \nNo major violence was immediately reported.\nAn election will be held within two months to replace Yoon, but a festering national divide over Yoon's impeachment will likely continue and could complicate South Korea's efforts to deal with President Trump's \"America First\" policies and North Korea's expanding ties with Russia, observers say. \nYoon said in a statement issued via his defense team that he deeply regrets failing to live up to the public's expectations, but stopped short of explicitly accepting the verdict. There have been fears he would incite efforts to resist his removal, since he earlier vowed to fight to the end. \nHe added that he will pray for the country and its people. \"It has been the greatest honor of my life to serve our nation,\" Yoon said. \nYoon's ruling People Power Party said it would accept the decision, but one of Yoon's lawyers, Yoon Kap-keun, called the ruling \"completely incomprehensible\" and a \"pure political decision.\" \nPrime Minister Han Duck-soo, the country's acting leader, vowed in a televised speech to ensure \"there are no gaps in national security and diplomacy\" and maintain public safety and order. Han was appointed prime minister, the country's No.2 official, by Yoon. \n\"Respecting the will of our sovereign people, I will do my utmost to manage the next presidential election in accordance with the constitution and the law, ensuring a smooth transition to the next administration,\" Han said. \nSurveys show Lee Jae-myung, leader of the main liberal opposition Democratic Party, is the early favorite to win the election to choose Yoon's successor. Lee is facing trials for corruption and other charges. \nLee welcomed the ruling and credited the South Korean people for \"protecting our democratic republic.\" \n\"The courage of the people who stood in the face of guns, swords and tanks, along with the bravery of troops who refused to obey unjust orders, has led to this great revolution of light,\" Lee said.\nMartial law lasted only six hours, but left behind a political crisis, rattling financial markets and unsettling the country's diplomatic partners. In January, Yoon was separately arrested and indicted by prosecutors on alleged rebellion in connection with his decree, a charge that carries the death penalty or a life sentence if convicted. \nUnder Yoon's decree, the first of its kind in more than 40 years, hundreds of soldiers were dispatched to the assembly, election offices and other sites. Special operations soldiers smashed windows at the National Assembly and scuffled with citizens gathered to protest, shocking South Koreans and evoking traumatic memories of military rule. \nEnough lawmakers, including some from the ruling party, managed to enter the assembly to vote down his decree unanimously. \nNo major violence occurred during the brief period of martial law, but some senior military and police officers sent to the assembly have testified that Yoon ordered them to drag out lawmakers to block a vote on his decree or to detain his political rivals. Yoon says the troops were deployed to the assembly simply to maintain order. \nYoon, 64, a conservative, was impeached by the liberal opposition-controlled National Assembly on Dec. 14. The assembly accused him of violating the constitution and other laws by suppressing assembly activities, attempting to detain politicians, and undermining peace across the country. \nIn his final testimony at the Constitutional Court hearing, Yoon said his decree was a desperate attempt to draw public support of his fight against the \"wickedness\" of the Democratic Party, which had obstructed his agenda, impeached top officials and slashed the government's budget bill. He earlier called the National Assembly \"a den of criminals\" and \"anti-state forces.\" \nSome experts say Yoon may have imposed military rule to head off a possible independent investigation into scandals involving his wife, Kim Keon Hee. \nWithout presidential immunity, Yoon could face other criminal charges, such as abuse of power. He's the first South Korean president to be arrested or indicted while in office. \nYoon served as prosecutor-general under his predecessor, liberal President Moon Jae-in, before joining the now-ruling party in 2021 following disputes with Moon allies. A public image as strong-minded and uncompromising helped him defeat Lee in the close-fought 2022 presidential election. But after becoming president, Yoon has faced criticism that he refused to replace officials implicated in scandals and vetoed many bills passed by the assembly. \n (c) 2025 The Associated Press.

Haugh led the NSA and Cyber Command with steady, effective leadership,\" Senator Mark Kelly of Arizona wrote on social media Friday.\n\"By dismissing him and failing to hold anyone accountable for the threat to U.S. pilots over Signal, Trump has shown he values loyalty over competence - making us all less safe.\"\nAnother Democratic senator, Mark Warner of Virginia, echoed that sentiment, calling the situation \"so crazy it defies belief\".\n\"Trump refused to fire the people that embarrassed America and risked servicemembers' lives in the Signalgate scandal,\" Warner wrote, \"but fired Gen.

She makes recommendations.\"\nWhen pressed about what that meant, he conceded that Loomer not only recommends individuals to hire - but also to fire. He did, however, dismiss reports that Loomer was involved in a purge of security officials.\nLoomer herself addressed Haugh's removal on Thursday, accusing the four-star general of insufficient loyalty to the Trump administration. She also attempted to paint Haugh as an acolyte of former President Joe Biden, the Democrat who bested Trump in the 2020 election.\n\"NSA Director Tim Haugh and his deputy Wendy Noble have been disloyal to President Trump. That is why they have been fired,\" she wrote.\n\"Their firings are a blessing for the American people. Thank you President Trump for being receptive to the vetting materials provided to you and thank you for firing these Biden holdovers.\"\nLoomer has long been a controversial figure on the US right. She once called herself a \"proud Islamophobe\" and has spread the debunked conspiracy theory that the attacks on September 11, 2001, were an \"inside job\".\nHer proximity to the president has caused ripples of concern within Trump's administration - and has been seized upon as a point of criticism for Democrats.\nThe ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, Jim Himes, demanded an \"immediate explanation\" for Haugh's firing, arguing it makes \"all of us less safe\".\n\"I have known General Haugh to be an honest and forthright leader who followed the law and put national security first,\" Himes wrote. \"I fear those are precisely the qualities that could lead to his firing in this Administration.\" \n Follow Al Jazeera English:",

      "summary": "The controversy broke out when the face of  \"El Mencho\" — who has a $15 million bounty on his head in the U.S. —  was projected behind the band.",
      "content": "Watch CBS News \n Updated on: April 3, 2025 / 7:06 AM EDT\n / CBS/AP \n The U.S. State Department revoked the visas of members of a Mexican band after they projected the face of a drug cartel boss onto a large screen during a performance in the western state of Jalisco over the weekend.\nU.S. Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau, who was U.S. ambassador to Mexico during the first Trump administration, said late Tuesday on social media that the work and tourism visas of members of Los Alegres del Barranco were revoked.\nThe visa revocations follow widespread outrage in Mexico over the concert as prosecutors in two states have launched investigations into the projected images, and a larger national reckoning over how to address the rise of a popular musical genre criticized for romanticizing drug cartels.\n\"I'm a firm believer in freedom of expression, but that doesn't mean that expression should be free of consequences,\" Landau wrote on X. \"The last thing we need is a welcome mat for people who extol criminals and terrorists.\"\nThe controversy broke out over the weekend when the face of Nemesio Ruben \"El Mencho\" Oseguera Cervantes layered over flames was projected behind the band, originally hailing from Sinaloa, during the concert. Finger pointing ensued among the band, concert producers and the venue.\nOseguera is the leader of the Jalisco New Generation Cartel, which has been connected to a ranch authorities say was used to train cartel recruits and possibly dispose of bodies in Jalisco, where searchers found human bone fragments, heaps of clothing and shoes. The U.S. government has offered a $15 million reward for information leading to Oseguera's capture. In November, his son-in-law was arrested in California after U.S. officials say he faked his own death to \"live a life of luxury\" north of the border.\nThe Jalisco cartel is among other criminal groups in Mexico that have been designated as foreign terrorist organizations by the Trump administration.\nWhile the image was met by applause during the concert, Jalisco prosecutors quickly announced they were summoning the band to testify in an investigation into whether they were promoting violence, a crime which could result in a penalty of up to six months in prison. The state of Michoacan also announced an investigation into the Los Alegres del Barranco for projecting the same images during a concert in the city of Uruapan.\nJalisco Gov. Pablo Lemus said that the state would ban musical performances that glorify violence, adding that violators would \"face monetary and criminal sanctions.\"\n\"We know that outrage is not enough,\" Lemus said. \"Of course it's possible to ban (the music).\"\nSince, a number of the band's future shows have been canceled, one town's government saying that the show \"didn't have the municipal permissions needed\" to carry out the performance.\nPavel Moreno, the band's accordion player and back-up singer, didn't respond to questions by fans asking if his visa had been revoked, simply thanking them for support and saying that \"everything is fine.\"\nThe band was scheduled to play in Tulsa, Oklahoma on April 4. While the event hasn't been publicly canceled, ticket sales websites read: \"No tickets available for now on our site\" for that date.\nThe dispute coincides with a larger cultural debate in Mexico as artists like Peso Pluma, Fuerza Regida and Natanael Cano usher in a global renaissance of Mexican regional music, by mixing classic ballads with trap music. In 2023, Peso Pluma beat Taylor Swift out as the most streamed artist on YouTube.\nMany of the artists now topping the charts have come under fierce criticism because their lyrics often paint cartel leaders as Robin Hood-esque figures. Others say that the genre, known as \"narco corridos,\" expresses the harsh realities of many youths across Mexico.\nA number of Mexican states have banned public performances of the music in recent years, the most recent being the state of Nayarit in February. Some of the bans have come as famed artists have received death threats from cartels, forcing a number of them to cancel their performances.\nOthers, including Mexico President Claudia Sheinbaum, have sought a less aggressive approach to addressing the genre. Sheinbaum, who has come out against censoring the music, has suggested instead that the Mexican government push forward initiatives that promote Mexican regional music with more socially acceptable lyrics.\nThe Mexican leader did harden her language on the topic following the Los Alegres del Barranco concert. In her morning news briefing this week, Sheinbaum demanded an investigation into the concert, saying: \"You can't justify violence or criminal groups.\"\nIn December, videos posted on social media from a town in the western state of Michoacan, showed a sign at a Christmas fair thanking the Jalisco cartel's leader for the gifts.\n\"The children of Coalcoman thank Mr. Nemesio Oseguera and his sons, 2, 3, and Delta 1, for their noble gesture. Thank for your gifts,\" the sign read.\nSheinbaum said at the time that local officials were being investigated for any possible links to the sign. \n (c) 2025 CBS Interactive Inc.

      "content": "Markets tumbled in Wall Street's worst crisis since the pandemic as investors fled after China retaliated against tariffs.\nTwo days after sending the economy reeling by announcing widespread tariffs, United States President Donald Trump headed to play golf at Mar-a-Lago, his private club in Palm Beach, Florida, even as the sell-off for financial markets worldwide is slamming into a higher, scarier gear.\nBefore heading to his private golf course, Trump wrote on social media: \"THIS IS A GREAT TIME TO GET RICH.\"\nInvestors are not buying that message.\nThe S&P 500 tumbled 5.7 percent as Wall Street's worst crisis since the COVID pandemic crash deepened after China matched Trump's big rise in tariffs announced earlier this week. The move increases the stakes in a trade war that could end with a recession that hurts everyone. Not even a better-than-expected report on the US job market, which is usually the economic highlight of each month, was enough to stop the slide.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged 2,034 points, or 5 percent, and the Nasdaq composite was 5.6 percent lower, with an hour remaining in trading.\nSo far, there have been few, if any, winners in financial markets from the trade war. European stocks dropped roughly 5 percent. The price of crude oil tumbled to its lowest level since 2021. Other basic building blocks for economic growth, such as copper, also saw prices slide on worries the trade war will weaken the global economy.\nThe central question looking ahead is: Will the trade war cause a global recession? If it does, stock prices will likely need to come down even more than they have already. The S&P 500 is down roughly 17 percent from its record set in February.\nInvestors do not expect volatility to subside quickly.\n\"Until there's actually a change in the policy or evidence of real negotiations going on, the market's going to be under pressure,\" said Kathy Jones, chief fixed income strategist at the Schwab Center for Financial Research in New York.\nAdding to market fears on Friday were comments from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, who said that the tariffs were \"significantly larger than expected\" and are \"highly likely\" to cause more inflation - at least in the short term but possibly in the long term as well. \n However, Trump has described his policies as a painful yet necessary step to encourage companies to relocate their operations to the United States. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told conservative commentator Tucker Carlson in an interview released Friday that \"I think we have to try this, and I have a high confidence ratio it's going to work.\"\nThe president spent Friday morning defending himself on Truth Social, his social media platform, and promising to stay the course.\n\"TO THE MANY INVESTORS COMING INTO THE UNITED STATES AND INVESTING MASSIVE AMOUNTS OF MONEY, MY POLICIES WILL NEVER CHANGE,\" he wrote.\nAlthough experts have harshly criticised the tariffs, Trump has found some support on TikTok. The president shared a video that claimed \"Trump is crashing the stock market\" and \"he's doing it on purpose\" as part of a \"secret game he's playing, and it could make you rich\".\nThe video featured a supposed quote from legendary investor Warren Buffett praising Trump, but Buffett's company issued a statement saying it was fabricated. The video also said that Trump's goal is to push the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates, something that the president explicitly called for later in the morning.\n\"This would be a PERFECT time\" for Powell to cut interest rates, he wrote. \"CUT INTEREST RATES, JEROME, AND STOP PLAYING POLITICS!\" \n With foreign leaders scrambling in response to Trump's announcement this week, the president lashed out and looked to cut deals.\nHe said he spoke with Vietnamese leader To Lam and claimed Vietnam wants to eliminate its tariffs on US goods if it can make a deal with the US.\nHe also criticised China on Truth Social for announcing its own tariffs on US imports.\n\"CHINA PLAYED IT WRONG, THEY PANICKED - THE ONE THING THEY CANNOT AFFORD TO DO!\" he wrote.\nRepublicans suggested that Trump's policies would be the start of a parley with foreign countries.\n\"The president is a dealmaker if nothing else, and he's going to continue to deal country by country with each of them,\" said Senator John Barrasso of Wyoming. He added that Treasury Secretary Bessent had told Senate Republicans this week that the tariffs would be a \"high-level mark with the ultimate goal of getting them reduced\", unless other countries retaliate.\nMeanwhile, Trump also celebrated a new report showing the US added 228,000 jobs in March, beating expectations.

The new tariff matches the rate of the U.S. tariff announced by President Trump this week, which he called a \"reciprocal\" measure, claiming China had tariffs and other measures in place on U.S. goods already that amounted to a 67% trade barrier. \nFor Mr. Trump's so-called \"Liberation Day\" tariffs, the White House used a formula to calculate the sum of all the trade practices it deems unfair from other nations, including currency manipulation, tariffs and other barriers, in reaching its decision on how heavily to tariff almost every other country in the world. Economists have questioned the methodology, and many foreign governments have complained the levies are unfair and misrepresent their trade imbalances with the U.S.\nThe Commerce Ministry in Beijing also said in a notice that it will impose more export controls on rare earths, which are materials used in high-tech products such as computer chips and electric vehicle batteries. \nIncluded in the list of minerals subject to controls was samarium and its compounds, which are used in aerospace manufacturing and the defense sector. Another element called gadolinium is used in MRI scans.\nChina's customs administration said it had suspended imports of chicken from two U.S. suppliers, Mountaire Farms of Delaware and Coastal Processing. It said Chinese customs had repeatedly detected furazolidone, a drug banned in China, in shipments from those companies.\nAdditionally, the Chinese government said it has added 27 firms to lists of companies subject to trade sanctions or export controls. Among them, 16 are subject to a ban on the export of \"dual-use\" goods. High Point Aerotechnologies, a defense tech company, and Universal Logistics Holding, a publicly traded transportation and logistics company, were among those listed.\nBeijing also announced Friday that it had filed a lawsuit with the World Trade Organization over the Trump administration's tariffs.\nLater Friday, Mr. Trump criticized China's decision to match his tariffs, saying in a social media post: \"CHINA PLAYED IT WRONG, THEY PANICKED -- THE ONE THING THEY CANNOT AFFORD TO DO!\"\nThe Trump administration's unveiling of its massive package of tariffs this week has proven a gut-punch for global stocks, with American markets recording their worst day of losses Thursday since the COVID pandemic struck. That hemorrhaging of stock values continued in Asian and European markets Friday as China announced its retaliation -- becoming the first country to do so since Mr. Trump made his announcement at the White House on Wednesday.\nChina and other nations have voiced hope that new trade agreements with Washington can be struck, and they stress they will pursue negotiations that Mr. Trump has indicated an openness to, but even close allies such as the United Kingdom, which was hit with the minimum 10% base rate tariff on Wednesday, have also made clear that retaliatory measures remain under consideration. \n (c) 2025 CBS Interactive Inc.

      "content": "Watch CBS News \n Updated on: April 3, 2025 / 11:49 AM EDT\n / CBS News \n In a move that could upend American foreign relations across the globe, President Trump announced Wednesday that he is imposing what he calls \"reciprocal tariffs\" on virtually every nation the U.S. engages with in trade. From April 5, all imports to the U.S. will be subject to a baseline tariff of 10%. Then, beginning April 9, about 90 countries that the Trump administration says currently impose unfair barriers on imported U.S. goods will be hit by additional \"reciprocal\" taxes.\nSome of the Asian nations from which the U.S. has long imported vast quantities of consumer goods will be subjected to the highest tariffs, including a 34% blanket levy on imports from China, which quickly vowed to impose unspecified \"countermeasures to safeguard its own rights and interests.\"\nA number of nations, including Britain, Brazil and Egypt, were hit with the lowest, base-rate 10% tariffs.\nEconomists have warned that across-the-board tariffs could impact lower-income Americans' finances the most and increase the likelihood of a recession. \nThe response from other world leaders to Mr. Trump's announcement has almost universally included critique -- or outright condemnation -- of the American leader's overt pressure tactics, but it has also shown a recognition of the importance other countries place on trade relations with the world's largest economy.\nBelow is a look at the criticism -- and the desire to salvage economic relations with Washington -- emanating from capital cities across the globe.\nA White House official told CBS News that the tariffs announced Wednesday by Mr. Trump will be additive, meaning the 34% \"retaliatory tariffs\" will be on top of 20% levies imposed by Washington earlier this year.\n\"China firmly opposes this and will take countermeasures to safeguard its own rights and interests,\" China's Commerce Ministry said in a statement. \"There are no winners in trade wars, and there is no way out for protectionism. China urges the U.S. to immediately lift unilateral tariffs and properly resolve differences with its trading partners through dialogue on an equal footing.\"\n\"Protectionism has no exit ramp,\" Foreign Ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun said Thursday, urging Washington to drop the new taxes on Chinese imports. \"What the U.S. needs to do now is correct its wrong practices and resolve economic and trade differences with other countries -- including China -- through fair, respectful and reciprocal consultations.\" \nBeijing did not indicate what countermeasures it might take but in separate remarks, Ministry of Commerce spokesman He Yadong said \"the trade and economic departments of China and the United States have been maintaining communication,\" and he added that Asia's largest economy remained \"willing to engage with the United States on important issues in bilateral trade.\"\nOverall, the 27-nation European Union bloc is one of the United States' biggest trade partners and, as a collective entity, has come under some of Mr. Trump's most vociferous criticism for what he considers an unfair imbalance in economic relations.\nThe EU will be hit next week with a blanket 20% \"reciprocal tariff\" on its exports to the U.S., Mr. Trump announced Wednesday.\n\"I know that many of you feel let down by our oldest ally,\" European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said in a video statement. While she was unequivocal in predicting that Mr. Trump's tactics would negatively impact the entire world, she signaled that the EU would at least wait to see if a new trade deal can be reached before imposing additional retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods.\n\"President Trump's announcement of universal tariffs on the whole world, including the EU, is a major blow to the world economy,\" she said. \"Uncertainty will spiral and trigger the rise of further protectionism. The consequences will be dire for millions of people around the globe.\"\nVon der Leyen said the EU was \"already finalizing a first package of countermeasures in response to tariffs on steel, and we are now preparing for further countermeasures, to protect our interests and our businesses if negotiations fail.\"\nThe reaction to Mr. Trump's announcement from individual EU member states was, in some cases, more pointed. \nIn Germany, the bloc's biggest single largest economy and a major exporter of vehicles to the U.S., in particular, Economy Minister Robert Habeck predicted a U-turn by the American president -- if the EU is able to maintain a united front and push back against the tariffs with measures of its own.\n\"That is what I see, that Donald Trump buckles under pressure, corrects his announcements under pressure, but the logical consequence is that he must also feel the pressure, and this pressure must now be exerted from Germany, from Europe,\" Habeck said, according to the Reuters news agency.\nGermany's leader, Chancellor Olaf Scholz, called Mr. Trump's tariffs \"fundamentally wrong\" and \"an attack on a trade system that has created prosperity all round the world -- itself an American achievement.\" \n\"The EU has the strongest internal market in the world with 450 million consumers, which gives us the strength to hold talks with the U.S. government to avert a trade war,\" he said. \"We want cooperation, not confrontation, and will defend our interests. Europe will respond united, strong and proportionately to this decision.\"\nGiorgia Meloni, Italy's right-wing prime minister and a Trump ally who visited him at Mar-a-Lago in January, called the 20% tariff on EU imports \"wrong\" and a move \"that does not suit any party.\"\n\"We will do everything we can to work a deal with the United States, aiming to prevent a trade war that would inevitably weaken the West in favor of other global actors,\" Meloni said. \"In any case, as always, we will act in the interests of Italy and its economy, even by comparing ourselves with other European partners.\"\nIreland's Prime Minister Minister Micheal Martin, in a post on social media, called the U.S. tariffs on the EU \"deeply regrettable,\" adding: \"I strongly believe that tariffs benefit no one. My priority, and that of the government, is to protect Irish jobs and the Irish economy.\"\nThe U.K. pulled out of the EU almost a decade ago, and while the advantages and disadvantages of that \"Brexit\" remain hotly debated, it will see the U.K. dodge the higher 20% tariffs imposed on its European neighbors. But even the baseline 10% levy announced by Mr. Trump on Wednesday was met with disappointment in London and with a clear desire to keep the storied \"special relationship\" on track.\nPrime Minister Keir Starmer huddled early Thursday with the top executives from some of Britain's biggest businesses, eager to voice his support for their enterprises and also to draw on their economic acumen as he pushes for a new trade deal with the U.S., with the hope of getting all tariffs lifted.\n\"Clearly, there will be an economic impact from the decisions the U.S. has taken both here and globally,\" Starmer told the business leaders. \"But I want to be crystal clear: We are prepared.\n\"Nobody wins in a trade war. That is not in our national interest, and we have a fair and balanced trade relationship with the U.S.,\" Starmer argued, adding that \"negotiations on an economic prosperity deal -- one that strengthens our existing trading relationship [with the U.S.] -- they continue, and we will fight for the best deal for Britain.\"\n\"Today marks a new stage in our preparations,\" said Starmer. \"We have a range of levers at our disposal, and we will continue our work with businesses across the country to understand their assessment of these options. As I say, our intention remains to secure a deal. But nothing is off the table.\"\n\"We had been requesting that the U.S. government review its unilateral tariff measures at various levels and we are extremely disappointed and regret that such measures have been implemented nonetheless,\" Japan's Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba said Thursday as his nation woke up to the news of a new 24% levy being imposed by the White House -- which was taking a toll on the Nikkei stock market.\n\"We will continue to strongly urge the U.S. to review its measures,\" Ishiba said, according to Reuters.\nJapanese Trade Minister Yoji Muto, asked if Tokyo would retaliate with its own new trade barriers to U.S. imports, said the government would \"need to decide what is best for Japan, and most effective, in a careful but bold and speedy manner.\"\n\"The Brazilian government is evaluating all possible actions to ensure reciprocity in bilateral trade, including resorting to the World Trade Organization, in defense of legitimate national interests,\" the Brazilian government said in a statement Thursday, according to Reuters.\nThe statement came just after Brazil's Congress approved a bill that would give President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva a legal framework to respond to international tariffs, including with countermeasures such as retaliatory tariffs.\nThe government statement said Brazil remained open to negotiations with the U.S., and it rejected the White House's characterization of the 10% levy as \"reciprocal,\" saying that assessment does not \"reflect reality.\"\nLula said previously that Mr. Trump's decision to impose tariffs on America's trading partners risked damaging the U.S. economy, and he said Brazil would lodge a formal complaint with the WTO over a separate levy on Brazilian steel exports.\n\"It will raise the prices of goods and could lead to [U.S.] inflation that he hasn't yet realized,\" Lula said, according to Reuters. \"Protectionism doesn't help any country in the world.\"\nVietnam was among the nations hardest hit by Mr. Trump's tariff salvo on Wednesday, with the U.S. leader announcing 46% tariffs on exports from the Asian manufacturing hub. Its exports to the U.S. have flourished for years under the so-called China+1 strategy, which has seen Chinese manufacturers get around existing U.S. tariffs on their country by moving some production to other, less-heavily tariffed nations in the region.\nVietnamese officials did not immediately signal any plan to impose retaliatory measures.\nAs the nation's benchmark stock index appeared on course for its biggest single-day drop in four years and its currency hit an all-time low, Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh declared a new task force dedicated to addressing the rapidly changing economic situation after holding a cabinet meeting early Thursday.\nThe French news agency AFP spoke Thursday with Penn Sovicheat, a spokesman for Cambodia's commerce ministry, who blasted the Trump administration's imposition of a 49% levy on the country's exports as \"not reasonable.\"\nThe White House says Cambodia is among the nations, like Vietnam and Laos, that have developed their own economies by inviting Chinese investment under the China+1 strategy, enabling Chinese manufacturers to skirt existing U.S. trade barriers. According to Sovicheat, Cambodia exported about $10 billion worth of goods to the U.S. in 2024, largely clothing.\n\"China has turned Cambodia into the most important transshipment hub that Communist China uses to evade our tariffs,\" a White House official told reporters this week.\nSovicheat acknowledged that American imports to Cambodia, which he said amounted to around $264 million worth of goods last year, were taxed at an average of 29.4%, but the White House figures Mr. Trump unveiled Wednesday claim the Asian nation has tariffs and other trade barriers in place on U.S. goods amounting to 97%.\n\"The 49% tariffs is not a good image for Cambodian industry or our investment attraction,\" Sovicheat told AFP, adding that the government was hoping to negotiate a trade agreement with the Trump administration through existing entities such as the ASEAN trade bloc or the World Trade Organization.\nCambodian Commerce Minister Cham Nimul said in remarks aired by state TV that U.S. consumers would feel the impact of Mr. Trump's tariffs on his country before Cambodians, according to the AFP.\n\"The increase in tariffs means that the U.S. people who make the purchase orders of Cambodian products are the first people to be impacted, and next will be Cambodia and business people,\" she was quoted as saying.\nAustralia's Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said Thursday that Mr. Trump's 10% tariffs were \"not unexpected, but let me be clear, they are totally unwarranted.\"\n\"This is not the act of a friend,\" said Albanese, who, in addition to his frustration, appeared perplexed by the fact that the White House tariffs singled out some of his country's tiny, far-flung territories, including a group of islands that are home to lots of penguins, but no people. \nNorfolk Island is an inhabited Australian territory, but only by about 2,000 people, and Albanese called it \"a bit strange\" that it had been singled out by the White House and hit with an even greater tariff of 29%, nearly three times higher than the Australian mainland. \nThe uninhabited Heard Island and McDonald Islands were subject to the same 10% levy as mainland Australia, meanwhile, despite them rarely seeing human footprints due to \"the extreme isolation\" and the \"persistently severe weather and sea conditions\" in the sub-Antarctic area. \n Jordan Freiman, \n Caitlin Yilek and\n\n Alain Sherter\n\n contributed to this report.\n \n Tucker Reals is CBSNews.com's foreign editor, based in the CBS News London bureau.

      "content": "Watch CBS News \n Updated on: April 2, 2025 / 9:51 PM EDT\n / CBS News \n Washington -- President Trump on Wednesday announced the U.S. will impose a minimum baseline of 10% tariffs on goods imported from all foreign countries, as well as higher, \"reciprocal\" tariffs on nations that impose tariffs on U.S. exports, despite warnings from economists over increased prices.\nThe president, who signed an executive order to impose the tariffs, insisted the days of the U.S. being taken advantage of are \"over.\" The reciprocal tariffs, Mr. Trump said, will amount to roughly half the tariff rate those countries impose on U.S. exports, or less. Countries that will see tariffs higher than 10% include the European Union, China and Israel. \nSenior administration officials said the 10% worldwide tariffs take effect April 5 at 12:01 a.m., and the higher reciprocal tariffs go into effect on April 9 at 12:01 a.m.\n\"In short, chronic trade deficits are no longer merely an economic, they're a national emergency that threatens our security and our very way of life,\" the president said in a White House Rose Garden announcement. \"And for these reasons, starting tomorrow, the United States will implement reciprocal tariffs on other nations.\" \n\"For nations that treat us badly, we will calculate the combined rate of all their tariffs, non-monetary barriers and other forms of cheating, and because we are being very kind, we're a kind people, very kind,\" Mr. Trump said. \"You're not so kind when you're ripped off... We will charge them approximately half of what they are and have been charging us.\" \nAs he spoke, the president proudly held up a chart showing the new tariff rates the U.S. will begin to impose on allies, foes and everyone in between, \nCountries that will see \"discounted reciprocal rates,\" according to a sheet handed out by the White House, include China at a rate of 34%, on top of the tariffs the U.S. already imposes on China; 20% on goods from the European Union; 32% on Taiwan; 25% on South Korea and 17% on Israel. \nCanada and Mexico are not subject to these tariffs for now, senior administration officials said, but tariffs the president has already imposed, citing fentanyl and migration issues, persist. \nMr. Trump said \"horrendous\" trade imbalances have hurt the U.S. and put national security at risk, placing blame on previous U.S. presidents and administrations. \n\"It's our declaration of economic independence,\" the president said in the White House Rose Garden. Mr. Trump labeled Wednesday \"Liberation Day.\"\nThe president lamented that the U.S. imports phones and other electronics, as well as pharmaceuticals, saying that if there's a war, the U.S. would struggle. He said his moves Wednesday are also standing up for U.S. farmers and ranchers who have been \"brutalized\" by other countries, specifically blasting Canada. \nMr. Trump said the Americans \"subsidize\" a lot of other countries, calling out the European Union, China, South Korea and Australia for their trade practices. \n\"They've taken so much of our wealth away from us,\" Mr. Trump said of other countries. \nThe president said he expects complaints from \"globalists,\" \"outsourcers,\" \"special interests,\" and \"fake news\" in the days ahead, but insisted those groups have been wrong about trade before. \n\"In the first term, they said tariffs would crash the economy,\" Mr. Trump said. \"Instead, we built the greatest economy in the history of the world.\" \nIn the audience for the president's announcement were rank-and-file steelworkers and auto workers, House Speaker Mike Johnson, as well as most of Mr. Trump's Cabinet, including Vice President JD Vance. \nThe president says his plan will place a minimum baseline of 10% tariffs on all countries, with reciprocal tariffs on many trading partners that have their own tariffs placed on the U.S. The 25% tariffs the president previously announced on foreign cars and foreign auto parts are set to go into effect at midnight. \n A White House official said the reciprocal tariffs are additive, meaning they will be imposed in addition to any previous tariffs already in place, unless a specific good is exempt under Section 232 of the Tariffs Act, which carries a flat 25% rate on certain things like steel and aluminum.\nHere are some of the tariff rates that Mr. Trump announced:\nCountries that will see only the baseline 10% tariff rates include: Guatemala, Honduras, Argentina, El Salvador, Ecuador, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Australia and the United Kingdom. \nShawn Fain, president of United Auto Workers, told CBS News' \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Sunday that tariffs are one tool to get companies to bring jobs back to the U.S.\n\"Tariffs are a tool in the toolbox to get these companies to do the right thing, and- and the intent behind it is to bring jobs back here,\" Fain said. \"And, you know, invest in the American workers. The American working class people have been left behind for decades, and they're sick of it.\"\nTariffs are duties paid on goods imported into the U.S. The most common type of tariffs are ad valorem tariffs (Latin for \"according to the value\"), which represent a fixed percentage tax on the value of a product. The 25% auto tariffs are these types of tariffs. \nThere are also \"specific\" tariffs, which are levied as a fixed charge per unit, and \"tariff-rate quotas,\" which are taxes triggered by reaching a specific import threshold.\nEconomists and taxpayer advocacy groups have their doubts, and are warning tariffs could upset economic growth and will almost surely contribute to higher prices for American consumers. Some automakers have already announced higher car prices, after the president announced tariffs on foreign cars and parts. \nMore than a dozen leaders at think tanks and taxpayer advocacy groups, including at the National Taxpayers Union, the Taxpayers Protection Alliance, the Small Business & Entrepreneurship Council and the Competitive Enterprise Institute, on Tuesday sent a joint letter to congressional leaders and the commerce and treasury secretaries, urging them to consider how tariffs on steel, lumber, energy, pharmaceutical and medical supplies and cars and car parts will increase prices. \n\"We encourage you to consider whether tariffs may, in many cases, undermine President Trump's broader long-term economic goals by increasing the cost of goods subject to tariffs,\" they wrote. \"We are especially concerned about tariffs on inputs needed by U.S. manufacturers that make it harder to compete with finished goods made abroad and tariffs that increase the price of necessities like food and housing.\"\nAlex Jacquez, who worked on the Biden White House National Economic Council, said that although it's hard to know the exact impact of Mr. Trump's tariffs without knowing all the details, CEOs are telling investors and shareholders they will be hiking prices. \n\"What the major retailers and companies who may be affected by tariffs are planning to do and they're planning out in public here is pass these costs along to consumers as much as they possibly can,\" Jacquez, now the chief of policy and advocacy at Groundwork Collaborative, said on a call with reporters Tuesday. \nColin Grabow, associate director at the libertarian Cato Institute's Herbert A. Stiefel Center for Trade Policy Studies, wrote in a USA Today op-ed that \"tariffs are a costly and inefficient tax usually borne by the importing country's customers.\" \n\"Americans may have voted for lower prices in November, but under the guise of tariff reciprocity, the Trump administration is set to deliver something very different,\" Grabow wrote. \nA reporter on Tuesday asked Leavitt if the president is thinking about seniors on fixed income who are stressed about the recent swings in the stock market, swings partly attributed to the president's tariff announcements. Stocks have struggled as Wall Street braces for the next round of tariffs. \n\"Well certainly, they are legitimate concerns and the president takes those concerns very seriously,\" Leavitt said. \"And he's addressing them every single day. And tomorrow's announcement is to protect future generations of the senior citizens you mentioned. It's for their kids and their grandkids, to ensure that there are jobs here in the United States of America for their children to live the American dream, just like they presumably did.\"\nAnd the president told NBC News he \"couldn't care less\" if his tariffs lead to automakers raising their prices. \n\"I couldn't care less if they raise prices, because people are going to start buying American-made cars,\" he told NBC. \n Sara Cook and \n Jennifer Jacobs\n\n contributed to this report.\n \n Kathryn Watson is a politics reporter for CBS News Digital, based in Washington, D.C. \n (c) 2025 CBS Interactive Inc.

      "content": "Watch CBS News \n Updated on: April 2, 2025 / 8:11 AM EDT\n / CBS/AP \n Jerusalem -- Israel's renewed military offensive in the Gaza Strip is \"expanding to crush and clean the area\" of militants and to seize \"large areas that will be added to the security zones of the State of Israel,\" Defense Minister Israel Katz said in a written statement on Wednesday. The Israeli government has long maintained a buffer zone just inside Gaza along its security fence, which has greatly expanded since the war with Hamas was sparked by the groups Oct. 7, 2023 terrorist attack. \nIsrael says the buffer zone is needed for its security, but Palestinians view it as a land grab that further shrinks the narrow coastal territory, home to around 2 million people.\n Katz didn't specify which areas of Gaza would be seized in the expanded operation, which he said includes the \"extensive evacuation\" of the population from fighting areas. His statement came after the Israeli military ordered all civilians to evacuate the southern city of Rafah and nearby areas -- an order that came about two weeks after Israel abandoned a ceasefire that brokered by the U.S., Qatar and Egypt and resumed its bombardment of the Palestinian territory.\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said Israel aims to maintain an open-ended but unspecified security control of the Gaza Strip once it achieves its aim of crushing Hamas.\nKatz called on Gaza residents to \"expel Hamas and return all hostages.\" Hamas, long a U.S.- and Israeli-designated terrorist organization, still holds 59 captives, of whom 24 are believed to still be alive, after most of the rest were released in ceasefire agreements or other deals.\n \"This is the only way to end the war,\" Katz said.\n The Hostage Families Forum, which represents most captives' families and has long pushed for an agreement to end the war and bring their loved ones home, disagreed with that assessment, however. The forum issued a statement saying the families were \"horrified to wake up this morning to the Defense Minister's announcement about expanding military operations in Gaza.\"\nThe group said the Israeli government \"has an obligation to free all 59 hostages from Hamas captivity -- to pursue every possible channel to advance a deal for their release,\" and stressed that every passing day puts their loved ones' lives at greater risk.\n \"Their lives hang in the balance as more and more disturbing details continue to emerge about the horrific conditions they're being held in -- chained, abused, and in desperate need of medical attention,\" said the forum, which called on the Trump administration and other mediators to continue pressuring Hamas to release the hostages.\n\"Our highest priority must be an immediate deal to bring ALL hostages back home -- the living for rehabilitation and those killed for proper burial -- and end this war,\" the group said.\nIsrael continued to target the Gaza Strip 16 days after abandoning the ceasefire, with airstrikes overnight killing 17 people in the southern city of Khan Younis, hospital officials said. Officials at the Nasser Hospital said the bodies of 12 people killed in an overnight airstrike that were brought to the hospital included five women, one of them pregnant, and two children. Officials at the Gaza European Hospital said they received five bodies of people killed in two separate airstrikes.\nThe war was sparked by the Hamas-led terrorist attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, which killed about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and saw 251 others taken as hostages back into Gaza. \nIsrael's retaliatory war in Gaza has killed more than 50,400 Palestinians, including at least 1,066 killed since the ceasefire fell apart on March 18, according to Gaza's Hamas-run Health Ministry, which doesn't differentiate between civilian and combatant casualties.\nIsrael claims to have killed around 20,000 militants in Gaza, but it has not provided evidence.\nAs of March 23, more than 140,000 people had been displaced again since the end of the ceasefire, according to the latest U.N. estimate -- and tens of thousands more are estimated to have fled under evacuation orders over the past week. Every time families have moved during the war, they have had to leave behind belongings and start nearly from scratch, finding food, water and shelter. Now, with no fuel entering due to an Israeli blockade, transportation is even more difficult, so many are fleeing with almost nothing.\n\"With each displacement, we're tortured a thousand times,\" said former university professor Ihab Suliman, who spoke of having to flee eight times during the war with this family.\nFleeing from Rafah on Monday, Hanadi Dahoud said she was struggling to find essentials.\n \"Where do we go?\" she said. \"We just want to live. We are tired. There are long queues waiting for bread and charity kitchens.\"\nUnited Nations spokesman Stephane Dujarric said Tuesday that the U.N.'s myriad humanitarian aid agencies were \"at the tail end of our supplies,\" forcing the World Food Program to close all 25 of its bakeries in Gaza due to a lack of flour and cooking fuel.\n \"WFP doesn't close its bakeries for fun,\" Dujarric said, adding that the food situation remained \"very critical\" since Israel closed all crossings into Gaza a month ago, cutting off virtually all humanitarian deliveries into the enclave.\n COGAT, the Israeli military body in charge of civilian affairs in the Palestinian territories, said Tuesday that nearly 450,000 tons of aid entered Gaza during the ceasefire. COGAT claimed at least some of the aid from the U.N. and its humanitarian partners was being diverted to Hamas.\n Dujarric rejected that saying: \"The U.N. has kept a chain of custody, and a very good chain of custody, on all the aid.\" \n (c) 2025 CBS Interactive Inc.

Hamas still holds 59 hostages, prompting calls from families' groups for their immediate release and a deal for their return.  The offensive has resulted in significant civilian casualties on both sides, with Israel claiming to have killed around 20,000 militants and the Palestinian Health Ministry reporting over 50,400 Palestinian deaths.

I think you guys are really trying, step-by-step, to get to a situation where this war can end,\" Rutte said, before questioning Russia's commitment to the process.\n\"Russians also have to dance the tango, and at this moment they don't seem to do so,\" Rutte said, while the Ukrainians \"are really close to the American position.\"\nRussia has not yet agreed to a full 30-day ceasefire proposed by the U.S. and has said there are still outstanding issues that must be resolved first. \nRubio, who is attending a NATO conference in Brussels, told reporters Friday, \"We will know from their answers very soon whether they are serious about proceeding with real peace or whether it's a delay tactic.

It --you have to compare this to the days of the Cold War, when you look at the overall defense spending now being ramped up in Europe,\" Rutte said.\nPressed by Brennan over statements made by the leaders of Germany, Poland and France about expanding a western European nuclear umbrella -- beyond the assurances of protection provided by the U.S. and United Kingdom -- Rutte said he's confident in the U.S.' nuclear security guarantee.\n\"Marco Rubio this week basically repeated what President Trump has said three times now on television: that the U.S. is completely committed to NATO, is completely committed to Article 5,\" Rutte said. \"That includes the U.S. being the ultimate guarantor, through the nuclear deterrent, for NATO territory, including, and particularly of course, the European part of NATO.\" Article 5 says that an attack on any NATO member country is an attack on all members.\nRutte said the Trump administration has \"consistently\" said it is committed to the alliance.\n\"What I'm urging my European colleagues to do is to put on the television and sometimes listen to the senior American leadership when it comes to NATO,\" Rutte said. \"Instead of worrying constantly about, 'Is the U.S. still committed to NATO?'

      "content": "Watch CBS News \n Updated on: April 4, 2025 / 12:46 PM EDT\n / CBS Minnesota \n Just on the edge of the western Hudson Bay lies the small town of Churchill, Manitoba. \nHere, the sea meets the boreal forest under the rippling northern lights. Farther to the north, the trees stop growing. Snow coats a harsh landscape of Canadian shield, and the ceaseless wind cuts through the willows.\nNo roads lead to Churchill. Just a rail line and an airport runway, carrying the occasional charter plane.\nBut it attracts tourists and scientists alike because for a short time in the fall, the kings of the arctic migrate through town back to their homes on the frozen sea ice. Travelers come here, from all over the world, seeking one thing: to lock eyes with a polar bear.\nPolar bears meander through Churchill every autumn as they wait for ice on the bay to form. Males take to the ice first, roaming and testing out the edges, eager to travel north where they can finally hunt for the ringed seal - their primary food source.\nScientists converge on Churchill because it is the most accessible point to study polar bears. The bears here are the most researched in the world, and the most photographed. \nThese arctic beasts have big personalities: they play and cuddle and nap to pass the time. Males will often spar, trying to get to know each other so that they're prepared for the charged battles in the spring, during mating season.\nCubs stay close to their mothers for two to three years before they're chased off and forced to live on their own. For the following year, they test the waters - sometimes struggling to survive as they learn to hunt and sustain themselves in the tundra.\nIn recent years, however, the warming arctic is melting their habitat on the ice, changing the bears' behavior: scientists from Polar Bears International say the ice is forming two weeks later than it was in the 1980s, and receding two weeks earlier in the spring. \nThis monthlong change in their environment is forcing bears to keep to shore longer, closer to humans and farther from the seal lairs in the north.\nIt's a change -- sparked by the altering climate -- that their parents and grandparents didn't have to face. Yes, the bears have been constantly evolving, ever since they diverged from the grizzly roughly 500,000 years ago, but the pace of change is what is alarming scientists.\nChief climate scientist for Polar Bears International Flavio Lehner says because of the decline in sea ice, the polar bear population in the western Hudson Bay is as low as 618, approximately half of what it used to be in the 1980s.\n\"That's quite profound,\" he says. \"It's hard to find other places, other than maybe that have been deforested in the Amazon, where you see such a stark change in the ecosystem caused by climate change.\"\nLehner doesn't anticipate that the situation will improve, and beyond the population decline, he's seeing a behavioral shift as well. It used to be much more typical to find mothers with triplets, which, in his personal experience, is now rare. \nScientists at Polar Bears International say that these bears can only sustain themselves comfortably on land for 180 days. In other parts of the world, bears have been seen hunting birds and reindeer, but scientists say this high-protein diet can damage their kidneys, and doesn't stop them from losing 2-4 pounds a day when they're off the ice.\n\"The current pace of change is operating too fast,\" explained John Whiteman, chief research scientist with PBI. \"Polar bears won't be able to evolve or acclimate in time to be able to deal with our current rate of sea ice loss.\"\nWhiteman expects that the polar bears will stick around for the next 10 years or so in Churchill, but the timeline starts to get fuzzy 20 to 30 years into the future.\n\"We ultimately know if we lose sea ice, we lose polar bears,\" said Whiteman. \nChurchill has always been a town at the precipice. It's lived many lives -- from home to First Nations to trading post to military town to now, the polar bear capital of the world.\nIt attracts a special type of person. Often one that finds pleasure in the solitude. The people who come for employment are semi-nomadic tourist industry workers, or maybe they're looking for a change. They're guides and nature enthusiasts, seasonal workers attracted to this slow, simpler pace of life.\nOthers -- like the town's mayor of 30 years Mike Spence -- have spent their lives here. Back when he was a kid, conservation officers in town were shooting 20 to 22 bears a year. But over time, the approach has changed.\n\"First of all, we respect wildlife,\" he says. \"The polar bears are quite significant in the Indigenous world - it's at the top of its food chain. There's a lot of respect in that.\"\nThe town is now facing a future where the polar bear tourist season could potentially disappear. In the interim, the community will be forced to coexist more closely with the bears as they wait for the ice to form on the bay. And as infrastructure too struggles to adapt to a warming climate and melting permafrost, Spence is one of the many people looking for solutions. \n\"We've always been challenged,\" Spence says. But the community also \"usually finds a way.\"\nThose solutions include taking command of a port and rail line that collapsed in 2017 due to a combination of flooding and lack of maintenance. Once it starts operating at its full potential, the hope is that it will welcome more consistent jobs and resources for the community. Meanwhile, a new program in town grows microgreens, and new polar bear-resistant trash containers dot the streets, all to forge a sustainable path forward in the north for people, and the wildlife.\n\"What we need to do now is build on our young people growing up here, so that they play a bigger role in building a stronger community, and a bigger community,\" Spence says. \"They see for themselves what they've got is pretty precious.\"\nOn the outskirts of town, Wyatt Daley hooks up his sled dogs, preparing to lead the first of three tours for the day. Fall is peak tourist season, and he'll spend the day out among the trees of the boreal forest, gliding on the snow.\nChurchill relies on the tourism that comes from those wanting to see the polar bears. In order to sustain their businesses, some tourism companies are looking to pivot to protect their futures.\nOne of these ways is by advertising other aspects of this wild north - the aurora that dances overhead 300 nights of the year and the annual beluga whale migration in the summer. \nBut it's not just the economic engine that needs to be fueled: there's a yearning for families and the next generation to choose Churchill, tend to it and savor everything it has to offer.\nWyatt Daley was one of those children who, years ago, begged his parents to move further south. His father Dave, a dog musher and tourism company owner, would shake his head and tell him, \"We have the dogs, this is where we make our living.\" And that was the end of that particular conversation.\nHe watched his friends and their families move away - especially in the middle school years - searching for \"better opportunities.\" After graduation, he traveled throughout the world, working in the tourism industry in Australia and Cologne. But he came home. Back to the dogs, and back to Churchill.\nChurchill, he says, has given him \"everything.\" He feels a connection to the dogs, to the land. His father is his best friend. And that's exactly what he wants for his own son Noah - now 3 years old - who has an affinity for the dogs, too.\n\"I remember being a little kid and standing on the back ski with my dad and doing tours,\" he says. \"That's what I'm looking forward to most right now . . . I think about [Noah] coming out and doing tours with me.\"\nBut this legacy is threatened by the warming arctic, and it's a weight the Daleys feel as they fight to protect their way of life in the north.\n\"It's a scary thought to think the polar bears may not be here one day,\" Dave Daley says. \"The planet earth is a living being, and we're the ones treading on it and changing everything. I think we really need to get a handle on it and start taking this seriously.\"\nErin is back home in the Twin Cities after stops in South Korea and Omaha.

      "content": "Watch CBS News \n Updated on: April 3, 2025 / 10:35 AM EDT\n / CBS News \n Life-sized statues of a man and a woman were discovered in a tomb in Pompeii, researchers said, thousands of years after a deadly volcano wiped out the ancient Roman city. \nResearchers say the nearly life-size figures shed new light on life and religion in Pompeii, which was destroyed when Mt. Vesuvius erupted in 79 A.D. \nThe discovery was made while researchers from the archaeological site and the University of Valencia worked on an excavation focused on the necropolis of Porta Sarno, which was just outside the city, according to a news release. The site served as a burial ground, and was discovered in the 1990s during railway construction. Since 1998, researchers have found evidence of over 50 cremation burials in the necropolis. The current excavation, called \"Investigating the Archaeology of Death in Pompeii,\" has been ongoing since July 2024. \nThe statues were found in the southern half of the tomb, covered in pumice stone, according to a report by the researchers. The pumice stone indicated that this part of the tomb had been buried in earthquakes shortly before the eruption of Mt. Vesuvius. \nThe figures are a funerary relief, the researchers said. The couple may have been married and appear to have been \"well-to-do,\" according to the researchers. \n\"The delicacy and detail of the sculpture is remarkable,\" the researchers wrote. \"We can appreciate the careful carving of the hands, fingers and nails. We can also see the detailed work on the folds of the clothing and the ornaments: rings, bracelets, necklace, etc.\" \nThe woman's figure includes carved accessories that may indicate she was a priestess of Ceres, a Roman harvest and fertility goddess. Researchers said that it is likely only women from prominent families held this position. Priestesses wielded political power and had the highest social standing possible for Roman women. Statues of priestesses holding items associated with their positions are very rare in southern Italy, the researchers said.\nThe man is wearing a toga indicating that he is a Roman citizen. Both are depicted wearing rings that may be wedding bands. \nOther relics, including ointment jars that may have held perfumed oil, a broken mirror and a coin depicting the sea god Neptune were also found in the tomb. These items may have been important in funerary rites, the researchers said. \nThe statues may date back to the late Republican period, which ranged from 133 to 31 B.C., the researchers said. \nThe statues have been transferred to another part of Pompeii for restoration work. They will be featured in an exhibition that focuses on womanhood in ancient Pompeii, which will open on April 16. The restoration will be carried out in front of exhibition visitors, the park said. \nOther major finds have been unearthed in Pompeii in recent months. In February, paintings depicting Dionysus, the Greek god of wine, were discovered. The images were painted on the walls of a large banquet room. In January, archaeologists excavated a large private bathhouse that included multiple rooms and a plunge pool. \nKerry Breen is a news editor at CBSNews.com.

Macias Villamar escaped from a prison in Ecuador last year and is not in U.S. custody. \n\"The defendant was a ruthless leader and prolific drug trafficker for a violent transnational criminal organization,\" he said.\nWith an extensive criminal record including charges of murder and organized crime, Macias Villamar has cultivated a cult status among fellow gang members and the public in his home country. While behind bars in 2023, he released a video addressed to \"the Ecuadorian people\" while flanked by armed men. He also threw parties in prison, where he had access to everything from liquor to roosters for cockfighting matches. \nThe seven-count indictment unsealed in Brooklyn charges Macias Villamar and an unidentified co-defendant with international cocaine distribution, conspiracy and weapons counts, including smuggling firearms from the United States.\nLos Choneros employed people to buy firearms, components and ammunition in the United States and smuggle them into Ecuador, according to the indictment. Cocaine would flow into the United States with the help of Mexican cartels. Together, the groups controlled key cocaine trafficking routes through Ecuador, violently targeting law enforcement, politicians, lawyers and civilians who stood in the way.\n\"Los Choneros operated a vast network responsible for the shipment and distribution of multi-ton quantities of cocaine from South America through Central America and Mexico to the United States and elsewhere,\" the indictment says. \"The vast majority of drugs trafficked by Los Choneros were imported into the United States, where the drugs were consumed.\"\nIn January 2024, Macias Villamar was discovered missing from his prison cell in Quito, Ecuador, where he was serving a 34-year sentence for drug trafficking. A 60-day state of emergency was declared after his escape, the BBC reported.\nLast year, the U.S. Treasury imposed sanctions on the gang Los Choneros as well as Macias Villamar. \nEarlier this month, the Ecuadorian government announced that the reward for the capture of Macias Villamar would be increased to $1 million.\nLos Choneros is one of 20 criminal gangs declared \"terrorist groups\" by Ecuadoran President Daniel Noboa, who has led a war on drug gangs blamed for a surge in violent crime in the once-peaceful South American country. \nNoboa declared a state of emergency and deployed troops in the streets and violence-riddled prisons, resulting in a slight dip in homicide rates in 2024 from the previous year. The president took action last year after gunmen stormed and opened fire in a TV studio and bandits threatened random executions of civilians and security forces. A prosecutor investigating the assault was later shot dead.\nEarlier this year, a leader of one of Ecuador's biggest crime syndicates, Los Lobos, was arrested at his home in the coastal city of Portoviejo. The U.S. last year declared Los Lobos to be the largest drug trafficking organization in Ecuador. \n (c) 2025 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

The fourth missing soldier's body was recovered Tuesday, a day after the three other soldiers were found, the Army's Europe and Africa Command said in a statement.\nAll of the soldiers were assigned to the 1st Armored Brigade Combat Team, 3rd Infantry Division and were permanently stationed at Fort Stewart in Georgia.\nThe four soldiers were identified by the military as Sgt.

We are wrapping our arms around the families and loved ones of our Soldiers during incredibly difficult time.\" \nThe soldiers went missing last Tuesday, March 25, while conducting a mission to repair and tow an immobilized tactical vehicle. Their submerged armored recovery vehicle was located by the Army and Lithuanian authorities the following day. \nThe incident is being investigated by the Army and Lithuanian authorities.\nThe command said the vehicle was removed from a peat bog early Monday morning. In an update from over the weekend, the command said the vehicle was under at least 15 feet of water, clay-like mud and silt.\nThe discovery came after recovery dogs from Lithuania and the nearby country of Estonia joined the search effort, the command said earlier Tuesday. The dogs were placed in a U.S. Navy inflatable boat with the hope of picking up any trace scents from below the surface of the bog.\nHundreds of service members from the Army, Navy and the militaries of Lithuania and Poland helped in the effort to bring the 63-ton M88A2 Hercules armored recovery vehicle to the surface, the command said. Lithuanian civilian agencies also contributed to the effort, with the command calling the unstable ground conditions around the submerged vehicle an \"engineering challenge.\"\n\"I can't say enough about the support our Lithuanian Allies have provided us,\" Gen. Christopher Donahue, commander of U.S. Army Europe and Africa, said in Tuesday's statement. \"We have leaned on them, and they, alongside our Polish and Estonian Allies -- and our own Sailors, Airmen and experts from the Corps of Engineers -- have enabled us to find and bring home our Soldiers. This is a tragic event, but it reinforces what it means to have Allies and friends.\"\nExcavators, pumps and several hundred tons of gravel and earth were moved to the search area near Pabrade, close to the Lithuania-Belarus border, to pull up the vehicle.\nNorrie said that the soldiers who died in the incident were family.\n\"This loss is simply devastating,\" said Norrie Tuesday in a statement. \"...No words can capture the depth of sorrow or gratitude we feel for their service.\"\nThe soldiers identified were among 3,500 who deployed in January to various locations across Poland and the Baltic states for a nine-month rotation as part of Operation Atlantic Resolve in support of NATO. \nDuenez was an M1 Abrams tank system maintainer with over seven years in the Army. He arrived at Fort Stewart in February 2022. Duenez had previously been deployed to Poland in 2021 and Germany in 2022.\nCapt. Madyson K. Wellens, Diesel Forward Support Troop commander, said in a statement that Duenez greeted \"every challenge with a smile and a readiness to support anyone who required assistance.\"\nFranco, 25, was an M1 Abrams tank system maintainer who served in the Army for over six years. He arrived at Fort Stewart in 2019. He had been deployed to Korea in 2020 and Germany in 2022.\n\"Edvin was a friend whose influence touched so many,\" said Wellens.\nTaitano, 21, was a M1 Abrams tank system maintainer on his first deployment. He served in the Army for nearly two years. He arrived at Fort Stewart in October 2023, following his entry training. \nTaitano \"constantly brought the team together with his charisma and laughter,\" said Cpt. Matthew Lund, Darkhorse Troop commander, in a statement. \nThe final soldier to be identified, Troy S.

      "content": "Crowds of liberal protesters have amassed in cities across the US to denounce Donald Trump's presidency, in the largest nationwide show of opposition since Trump took office in January. \nThe \"Hands Off\" protest planners aimed to hold rallies in 1,200 locations, including in all 50 US states. Throngs of people turned out in Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, New York and Washington DC, among other cities, on Saturday. \nProtesters cited grievances with Trump's agenda ranging from social to economic issues. \nComing days after Trump's announcement that the US would impose import tariffs on most countries around the world, gatherings were also held outside the US, including in London, Paris and Berlin.\nIn Boston, some protesters said they were motivated by immigration raids on US university students that have led to arrests and deportation proceedings. \nLaw student Katie Smith told BBC News that she was motivated by Turkish international student Rumeysa Ozturk, whose arrest near Boston-area Tufts University by masked US agents was caught on camera last month.\n\"You can stand up today or you can be taken later,\" she said, adding: \"I'm not usually a protest girlie.\"\nIn London, protesters held signs reading, \"WTAF America?\", \"Stop hurting people\" and \"He's an idiot\".\nThey chanted \"hands off Canada\", \"hands off Greenland\" and \"hands off Ukraine\", referencing Trump's changes to US foreign policy. Trump has repeatedly expressed interest in annexing Canada and Greenland. He also got into a public dispute with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and has struggled to negotiate a peace deal between Ukraine and Russia.\nIn Washington DC, thousands of protesters gathered to watch speeches by Democratic lawmakers. Many remarks focused on the role played in Trump's administration by wealthy donors - most notably Elon Musk, who has served as an advisor to the president and spearheaded an effort to dramatically cut spending and the federal workforce.\nFlorida Congressman Maxwell Frost denounced the \"billionaire takeover of our government\".\n\"When you steal from the people, expect the people to rise up. At the ballot box and in the streets,\" he shouted.\nOne protester in Washington named Theresa told the BBC that she was there because \"we're losing our democratic rights\".\n\"I'm very concerned about the cuts they're making to the federal government,\" she said, adding that she is also concerned about retirement and education benefits. \nAsked if she thought Trump was receiving the protesters' message, she said: \"Well, let's see. [Trump has] been golfing just about every day.\"\nTrump held no public events on Saturday, and spent the day golfing at a resort he owns in Florida. He was scheduled to play golf again on Sunday.\nOne of Trump's top immigration advisors, Tom Homan, told Fox News on Saturday that protesters held a rally outside of his New York home, but that he was in Washington at the time. \n\"They can protest a vacant house all they want,\" Homan said, adding that their presence \"tied up\" law enforcement and prevented officials from seeing to more important tasks.\n\"Protests and rallies, they don't mean anything,\" Homan continued.\n\"So go ahead and exercise your first amendment [free speech] rights. It's not going to change the facts of the case.\"\nIt comes on the largest day of protests against Trump's administration since he returned to office.\nHigh winds and heavy rain were expected to continue into Sunday, delaying clean-up efforts. \nPeter and Barbie Reynolds have been detained for nine weeks in Afghanistan, where they have lived for 18 years.\n24-year-old Dylan Grant died after sustaining injuries after being bucked off a bull in the arena.\nAs economic uncertainty swirls and the markets take a hit, many in this deeply Republican area back the president's plan.\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

Several other executives saw their compensation reduced, including Rob Kapito, the firm's president, whose package shrank by 34% to $18.95 million.\n\n\n UBS' purchase of Credit Suisse's US subsidiaries can move forward, the Federal Reserve said Friday.\n\n\n The statement comes a month after UBS stepped in to rescue the embattled Swiss lender and prevent turmoil in the financial sector from spreading, after an emergency loan of nearly $54 billion from the Swiss National Bank failed to stop the carnage.\n\n\n The problems for Credit Suisse began when the Saudi National Bank, its largest backer, said it wouldn't put up more cash after buying a nearly 10% stake in the bank for $1.5 billion in 2022.\n\n\n Banking customers were already on edge after the collapses of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank -- so Credit Suisse shares tumbled more than 25% and saw billions of dollars of outflows.\n\n\n The global turmoil has led US lawmakers to call for tighter regulations on banks. The Fed board said UBS will provide a quarterly updated plan for combining UBS's and Credit Suisse's US business and operations.\n\n\n \"The implementation plan will address UBS's obligations to comply with more stringent enhanced prudential standards, including liquidity standards,\" the Fed said in a statement.\n\n\n UBS is shelling out 3 billion Swiss francs, or $3.25 billion, for Credit Suisse.\n\n\n Stocks slid Friday after a slate of earnings beats from big banks fueled concerns that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates at its next two meetings.\n\n\n Still, the major indices gained for the week. The Dow rose 400 points, or 1.2%. The S&P 500 gained 0.8% and the Nasdaq Composite advanced 0.3%.\n\n\n JPMorgan Chase on Friday reported first-quarter profit and revenue that crushed expectations, boosted by the Fed's interest rate hiking campaign. Citigroup, Wells Fargo and PNC Financial also reported strong results.\n\n\n CEO Jamie Dimon warned investors in the company's post-earnings conference call that they should prepare for interest rates to be higher for longer than expected.\n\n\n Wall Street seems to have taken note. Analysts increased their bets on a quarter-point rate hike at the Fed's meeting in May and another in June.\n\n\n Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller said Friday that the central bank needs to continue tightening monetary policy, further weighing down markets.\n\n\n Austan Goolsbee, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, said that it's \"definitely\" possible the United States enters a mild recession after the tumult in banking last month.\n\n\n Meanwhile, retail sales data declined more than expected, suggesting that Americans' spending power and the US economy are weakening.\n\n\n Consumer sentiment held fairly steady in April, even as concerns about a recession linger, according to the University of Michigan's latest monthly survey.\n\n\n \"There was too much news to digest this morning, but the key takeaway is that the Fed has room to do more harm,\" Edward Moya, senior market analyst at OANDA, said in a note.\n\n\n The Dow slipped 144 points, or 0.4%.\n\n\n The S&P 500 tumbled 0.2%.\n\n\n The Nasdaq Composite sank 0.4%.\n \n As stocks settle after the trading day, levels might still change slightly. \n Austan Goolsbee, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, said Friday he isn't discounting the recent assessment from central bank economists that the banking crisis will tip the United States into a mild recession later this year.\n\n\n \"There's no way you can look at current conditions around the world and in the US and not think that some mild recession is definitely on the table as a possibility,\" Goolsbee said Friday during an interview on CNBC's \"Squawk Box.\"\n\n\n He added that, when viewed historically, the monetary tightening campaign undertaken by the Fed -- hiking interest rates nine times in just over a year -- is expected to slow GDP growth.\n\n\n \"When you get numbers like retail sales and others that are declining, if you look at construction, I think we've got to think about what's the state of growth in the country,\" he said. \"Fortunately, the labor market continues to be very strong.\"\n\n\n Critics have lambasted the World Bank and, particularly, the International Monetary Fund, for predicting Russia's economy would hold relatively stable this year despite international sanctions.\n\n\n But sanctions are hurting Russia's economy, even if World Bank forecasts don't reflect it, according to the outgoing World Bank President David Malpass. Speaking to Julia Chatterley at the IMF-World Bank spring conference, David Malpass responded to criticism that you couldn't trust GDP and economic data from Russia. He admitted \"the quality of the data differs substantially by country...the reality is there's not very much in terms of double checking of data\".\n\n\n In January, the IMF projected that Russia's economy would expand by 0.3% this year and 2.1% the next. That was much more optimistic than the latest forecasts from the World Bank, which still penciled in a contraction of just 3.3% this year. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development was the most pessimistic, forecasting a 5.6% contraction in Russia's economy in 2023.\n\n\n Malpass said that GDP numbers were not capturing the \"reality\" and \"horror\" of the war, and noted the Russian economy was suffering.\n\n\n \"I think life is hard in Russia...they're excluded from travelling to many parts of the world, their supply chains have to change dramatically... young people moving out because they don't want to be part of this war,\" Malpass said.\n\n\n Consumer sentiment tracked by the University of Michigan held steady in April, according to a preliminary reading released Friday.\n\n\n So far, the university's monthly surveys have shown a limited impact from the banking crisis on consumers' attitudes, but Americans remain concerned about an upcoming recession and some lingering fears about inflation persist.\n\n\n \"Consumers are expecting a downturn, they're not feeling as dismal as they were last summer, but they're waiting for the other shoe to drop,\" said Joanne Hsu, director of the surveys of consumers at the University of Michigan, in an interview with Bloomberg TV on Friday morning.\n\n\n \"We now have about a month of data following the collapse of SVB, and there hasn't really been much of an effect on sentiment at all,\" she said.\n\n\n The latest survey also showed that higher gas prices helped push up year-ahead inflation expectations by a full percentage point, rising from 3.6% in March to 4.6% in April.\n\n\n \"Consumers are still feeling the pain of high prices,\" Hsu told Bloomberg, noting that survey respondents were now mentioning gas prices for the first time since fall.\n\n\n The latest cooldown in consumer and producer price hikes as well as the latest decline in retail sales are indications that the Federal Reserve's efforts are working to bring down high inflation, Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee told CNBC on Friday.\n\n\n \"You don't want to overreact to short-run news, but it feel likes like that's moving in the right direction,\" he said during an appearance on CNBC's \"Squawk Box.\"\n\n\n Goolsbee was quick to note that an area of critical importance to him in advance of the next Fed meeting is activity in banking and credit.\n \n Earlier this week, Goolsbee noted that the Fed needs to be \"on watch\" for tighter credit conditions as a result of the banking turmoil last month. He referenced private sector analyst estimates that the spillover effects of the crisis equate to the Fed enacting rate hikes anywhere from a quarter point to three-quarters of a point. \n \"I'm an old-school data dog,\" Goolsbee said Friday. \"What I would do is spend the next three weeks getting out and figuring out how much credit tightening is coming.\"\n\n\n Chief executives at some of the largest banks in the United States were forced to address the elephant in the room as they reported first-quarter earnings on Friday morning: The regional banking crisis that brought Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank to ruin last month.\n\n\n > Banking industry turmoil has added to risks of recessionary \"storm clouds\" on the horizon, said JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon Friday in a release. He added that \"the banking situation is distinct from 2008 as it has involved far fewer financial players and fewer issues that need to be resolved.\"\n\n\n Still, said Dimon, who leads the country's largest bank, \"financial conditions will likely tighten as lenders become more conservative, and we do not know if this will slow consumer spending.\"\n\n\n >\"We are glad to have been in a strong position to help support the US financial system during the recent events that impacted the banking industry,\" commented Wells Fargo CEO Charlie Scharf in a statement. \"Regional and community banks are an important part of our financial system and are uniquely positioned to serve their customers and communities.\"\n\n\n > \"I believe today's crisis of confidence in the regional banking sector will further accelerate capital markets growth, and BlackRock will be a central player,\" wrote BlackRock CEO Larry Fink on Friday.\n\n\n \"Increased financing through the capital markets will require the scale, multi-asset capabilities and excellence in portfolio construction that BlackRock consistently delivers across market cycles,\" he said in a statement.\n\n\n That means bad news for regional banks could be good news for BlackRock - the lack of trust in regional banks will drive more investment into capital markets and BlackRock is poised to benefit as that happens.\n\n\n \"Throughout our history, moments of market dislocation and disruption have served as inflection points for BlackRock,\" he explained.\n\n\n Regulators also hired BlackRock in early April to help the US government in the sale of the $114 billion in assets it collected from the collapse> Citigroup and PNC did not address the banking crisis in their releases, but will likely answer questions about how they've weathered the turmoil and what they see ahead at their first-quarter presentations, planned for 11 a.m. ET.\n\n\n JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon warned investors Friday not to be caught unawares if interest rates stay higher longer than expected.\n\n\n \"People need to be prepared. They shouldn't pray that they don't go up. They should prepare for them going up. And if it doesn't happen, serendipity,\" Dimon said on the company's post-earnings conference call.\n\n\n High interest rates have helped big banks, including JPMorgan Chase, since they widen the gap between the interest paid to customers and what they earn from investing that money. But climbing rates also helped drive last month's collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, which held 55% of its customers deposits in long-dated bonds whose value diminished as interest rates rose.\n\n\n Dimon stated that he believes the banking crisis will pass -- even though he expects its effects to reverberate through the sector for years to come -- but that the possibility of higher interest rates should remain on companies' radars.\n\n\n \"If and when that happens, it will address problems in the economy. For those who are too exposed to floating rates, or those who are too exposed to [refinancing] risk, those exposures will be in multiple parts of the economy,\" Dimon said.\n\n\n \"Now would be the time to fix it. Do not put yourself in a position where that risk is excessive for your company, your business, your investment pools,\" he said.\n\n\n Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase, the largest US bank, told investors Friday that he isn't too worried about a credit crunch resulting from the recent banking crisis.\n\n\n \"I wouldn't use the word[s] 'credit crunch,'\" he said in response to a question about whether he was worried that lending would tighten in the bank after the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. There will be \"a little bit of tightening,\" said Dimon, but that will mostly be contained within the real estate market.\n\n\n Dimon added that he's more worried about recession than a credit crunch.\n\n\n \"I just look at it as a kind of a thumb on the scale. It just makes the financing conditions a little bit tighter and increases the odds of a recession,\" he said. \"That's what that is. It's not like a credit crunch.\"\n\n\n JPMorgan Chase said Friday its exposure to the office sector is limited, addressing concerns about the commercial real estate industry's stability.\n\n\n \"Given the recent focus on commercial real estate, let me remind you that our office sector exposure is less than 10% of our portfolio and is focused in urban dense markets, and nearly two-thirds of our loans are multifamily, primarily in supply-constrained markets,\" said Jeremy Barnum, chief financial officer, in the company's post-earnings conference call.\n\n\n Investors and regulators are watching the $20 trillion US commercial real estate market for signs that it could be the next shoe to drop after the banking tumult last month. That's partly because the value of buildings is going down, particularly as offices in major cities remain vacant or half-empty as Americans opt to work from home.\n\n\n The commercial real estate industry's woes come after decades of unbridled growth powered by low interest rates and easy credit. That upward trend was interrupted by the Covid pandemic's onset, and then when the Federal Reserve started hiking interest rates aggressively last year to stabilize the economy.\n\n\n \"There are obviously some big things here and there to pay attention to, but in the scheme of things for us, not a big issue,\" Barnum said.\n\n\n Spending at US retailers fell in March as consumers pulled back amid recessionary fears fueled by the banking crisis.\n\n\n Retail sales, which are adjusted for seasonality but not for inflation, fell by 1% in March from the prior month, the Commerce Department reported on Friday. That was steeper than an expected 0.4% decline, according to Refinitiv, and above the revised 0.2% decline in the prior month.\n\n\n The drop was driven by a pullback in spending at department stores and on durable goods such as appliances and furniture. Spending at general merchandise stores fell 3% in March from the prior month and spending at gas stations declined 5.5% during the same period. Excluding gas station sales, retail spending retreated 0.6% in March from February.\n\n\n However, year-on-year retail spending rose 2.9%.\n\n\n Citigroup shares were up about 0.8% in premarket trading after the bank posted strong first-quarter profits, beating analyst expectations for both earnings per share and revenue.\n\n\n The bank brought in $21.4 billion in revenue versus expectations of $19.9 billion. Earnings per share were $2.19, estimates were for $1.67.\n\n\n Citi CEO Jane Fraser and CFO Mark Mason will hold an earnings presentation at 11 a.m. ET.\n\n\n Stocks slid Friday, even as big banks reported beats on their first-quarter earnings in an auspicious start to earnings season.\n\n\n Investors were watching for clues about the financial sector's stability, and whether the tumult in the sector last month could lead to tighter lending standards. A key point of interest was also how much big banks benefitted from increased deposit inflows when nervous customers fled from regional banks after the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank.\n\n\n JPMorgan, the largest bank in the United States and an economic bellwether, posted record revenue. Wells Fargo, Citigroup and PNC Financial Services also reported earnings beats.\n\n\n Shares of JPMorgan Chase gained 4.8%, Wells Fargo rose 0.7%, Citigroup added 1.9% and PNC Financial Services ticked up 0.3%.\n\n\n Meanwhile, retail sales came in weaker than expected as recession fears loom. Retail sales, which are adjusted for seasonality but not for inflation, fell by 1% in March from the month before, according to the Commerce Department. Economists expected a 0.4% decline, according to Refinitiv.\n\n\n The Dow fell 38 points, or about 0.1%.\n\n\n The S&P 500 sank 0.1%.\n\n\n The Nasdaq Composite declined 0.5%.\n\n\n The Federal Reserve could end its historic rate-hiking campaign after just one more quarter-point increase, said Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta President Raphael Bostic in a Thursday interview with Reuters.\n\n\n The Fed has approved nine rate hikes in a row since last March, the effects of which are only now starting to \"bite,\" Bostic said. Monetary policy can take months to trickle through the economy, but a slew of recent data suggests that inflation is finally cooling. The March Consumer Price Index shows price hikes have slowed for nine months in a row, and headline wholesale inflation reflected in the Producer Price Index has sunk to 2.7% after reaching double digit highs last year.\n\n\n Bostic said the recent \"chaos\" in the banking sector, after the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, persuaded him to rethink the pace of rate hikes. However, he told Reuters he believes the turmoil will not have any lasting impact on the the US economy.\n\n\n Analysts expect the Fed to raise rates by a quarter point at its upcoming policy meeting on May 2-3, according to the CME FedWatch Tool.\n\n\n Regional bank PNC Financial reported first-quarter revenue of $5.6 billion and earnings per share of $3.98 vs. expectations of $3.66. Shares rose 5% on the news.\n\n\n Wells Fargo reported first-quarter revenue of $20.7 billion against expectations of $20.1 billion. The San Francisco-based bank saw earnings of $4.9 billion, up from $3.8 billion a year earlier, an increase of about 32%. Shares of Wells Fargo rose 2.2%.\n\n\n JPMorgan Chase on Friday reported first-quarter profit and revenue that roundly beat expectations, boosted by a year of rate hikes from the Federal Reserve.\n\n\n The New York-based bank posted a profit of $12.6 billion or $4.10 per share. That's up from $8.3 billion, or $2.63 per share from the same period a year before. Analysts expected earnings of $3.41 per share, according to Refinitiv.\n\n\n With $3.67 trillion in assets, JPMorgan Chase is the largest bank in the United States and a bellwether for the US economy.\n\n\n \"The US economy continues to be on generally healthy footings -- consumers are still spending and have strong balance sheets, and businesses are in good shape. However, the storm clouds that we have been monitoring for the past year remain on the horizon,\" CEO Jamie Dimon said in a press release.\n\n\n Net interest income rose to $20.8 billion, up 49% from the prior year, driven by the aggressive interest rate campaign the Fed kicked off last year to stabilize prices.\n\n\n Deposits rose to $2.38 trillion during the first quarter from $2.34 trillion in the quarter ended in December. That comes after the banking tumult last month triggered a rush into big banks from nervous customers. Investors also looked to money market funds as a haven.\n\n\n A key point of conversation after last month's turmoil in the banking sector has been whether banks could tighten lending standards, leading customers to spend less as it becomes more difficult to borrow money for large purchases like homes and cars.\n\n\n \"Financial conditions will likely tighten as lenders become more conservative, and we do not know if this will slow consumer spending,\" Dimon said, adding that JPMorgan Chase is \"confident that we can serve the needs of our customers and clients in all environments.\"\n\n\n Shares of JPMorgan Chase climbed 6.1% in pre-market trading. The company's post-earnings conference call is slated for 8:30 a.m. ET.\n \n Stocks: US stock futures fell ahead of several bank earnings this morning. Investors also fretted a retail sales report that is expected to show consumers are pulling back on their spending. Dow futures were down 75 points, or 0.2%. S&P 500 futures fell 0.2%. Nasdaq futures were 0.4% lower. European stocks were higher and Asian stocks closed up. \n Fear & Greed Index: 67 = Greed \n Oil & gas: US oil prices were up 0.3% to $82 a barrel. Average US gas prices rose to $3.66 a gallon. \n Wall Street is searching for answers to two key questions: Is the economy headed for a recession? And, if so, who's poised to weather it?\n\n\n Recession fears have ramped up in recent weeks after the banking tumult last month raised concerns about the financial sector's health.\n\n\n Earnings season for banks starts on Friday with JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, BlackRock, Citigroup and PNC Financial Services slated to report before the bell. Investors will be watching for clues about stability.\n\n\n Stocks have yet to price in the economy's precarious position, with the S&P 500 adding about 7% this year. But markets have already seen volatile trading since then.\n\n\n \"We're going to see a correction happen here, because it just never makes sense when the market's going up and earnings are going down,\" says Eric Sterner, chief investment officer at Apollon Wealth Management.\n\n\n But while earnings are an undeniable factor driving markets, inflation remains a key concern. Wall Street remains overly optimistic that the Fed will cut rates later this year -- even after officials indicated last month that they likely won't -- or that it could even orchestrate a soft landing. That hope, and the market's resilience, could start to crumble in the next few weeks, said Megan Horneman, chief investment officer at Verdence Capital Advisors.\n\n\n \"You very well could see that catalyst over the next couple of weeks with earnings, and then this inflation data and then what the Fed says when they meet,\" said Horneman.\n\n\n Jeremy Grantham made his name predicting the dot-com crash in 2000 and the financial crisis in 2008. Now, the famous investor warns another epic bubble in financial markets is bursting -- and the turmoil that swept through the banking sector last month is just the beginning.\n\n\n \"Other things will break, and who knows what they will be,\" Grantham told CNN in an exclusive interview. \"We're by no means finished with the stress to the financial system.\"\n\n\n Since early 2022, when the S&P 500 hit an all-time high, US stocks have dropped about 15% as central banks have jacked up borrowing costs. But Grantham sees much steeper declines on the horizon.\n\n\n The \"best we can hope for,\" he said, is a fall of about 27% from current levels, while the worst-case scenario would see a plunge of more than 50%. The low point might not arrive until \"deep into next year,\" he added.\n\n\n Grantham sees uncomfortable parallels between markets today and 2000, when an explosion in the price of tech stocks was followed by a dizzying crash. There are also echoes of 2008, when a painful comedown in the US housing market almost broke the banking system.\n\n\n What's even more worrying is that this time, bubbles in the stock market and the real estate market are poised to burst simultaneously, Grantham said.\n\n\n The broader US banking system remains sound and stable, but the two regional banks that failed were \"poorly managed\" and \"took unacceptable risks,\" White House economic adviser Lael Brainard told CNN's Poppy Harlow in an interview Wednesday at Semafor's World Economy Summit in Washington, DC.\n\n\n Last month's collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank roiled markets and spread fear through the economy of a possible wider banking crisis.\n\n\n The US Treasury, Federal Reserve and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation all intervened to ensure bank customers could access all their money and to attempt to stave off future bank runs.\n\n\n \"The banking system, it's very sound, it's stable; the core of the banking system has a great deal of capital that was put in place in the wake of the 2008-2009 global financial crisis,\" said Brainard, director of the White House National Economic Council. \"There were some banks who were not managing their risks effectively. They failed, and the president took strong actions along with the Secretary of the Treasury and the banking regulators,\" she said.\n\n\n \"Those actions reassured Americans their deposits are safe, the banking system is sound; but it was also important to the president that the executives of those failed banks were held accountable and, very important, that taxpayer money not be at risk,\" she continued.\n\n\n Before its collapse last month, Silicon Valley Bank was known to investors of color as a place that fostered a community of minority entrepreneurs and provided them with both social and financial capital.\n\n\n SVB regularly sponsored conferences and networking events for minority entrepreneurs, and it was well known for funding the annual State of Black Venture Report spearheaded by BLK VC, a nonprofit organization that connects and empowers Black investors.\n\n\n \"When other banks were saying no, SVB would say yes,\" said Joynicole Martinez, a 25-year entrepreneur and chief advancement and innovation officer for Rising Tide Capital, a nonprofit organization founded in 2004 to connect entrepreneurs with investors and mentors.\n\n\n Minority business owners have long faced challenges accessing capital due to discriminatory lending practices, experts say. Data from the Small Business Credit Survey, a collaboration of all 12 Federal Reserve banks, shows disparities on denial rates for bank and nonbank loans.\n\n\n In 2021, about 16% of Black-led companies acquired the total amount of business financing they sought from banks, compared to 35% of White-owned companies, the survey shows.\n\n\n \"We know there's historic, systemic, and just blatant racism that's inherent in lending and banking. We have to start there and not tip-toe around it,\" Martinez told CNN.\n\n\n The Financial Services Forum, an organization representing the eight largest financial institutions in the United States has said banks have committed millions of dollars since 2020 to address economic and racial inequality.\n \n Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

      "content": "Editor's Note: Featuring the good, the bad and the ugly, 'Look of the Week' is a regular series dedicated to unpacking the most talked about outfit of the last seven days. \n Bringing the second day of this year's Coachella to a close, K-Pop girl group Blackpink made history Saturday night when they became the first Asian act to ever headline the festival. To a crowd of, reportedly, over 125,000 people, Jennie, Jisoo, Lisa and Rose used the ground-breaking moment to pay homage to Korean heritage by arriving onstage in hanboks: a traditional type of dress.\n\n\n While the garments were shrugged off a few seconds into their opening track, \"Pink Venom,\" revealing each member's custom black and pink Dolce and Gabbana outfit, fans across the world had already received the message. Screenshots of the moment quickly spread among Blackpink superfans, otherwise known as Blinks. \"The way they stepped onto the biggest western stage in hanboks ... literally proved their place at the top of the industry,\" tweeted one Blink. \"Blackpink really are in a league of their own.\"\n\n\n Another called the group \"Korea's cultural delegation\" on Instagram, in reference to not only the hanboks but other visual cues incorporated into their show, such as one of the stage backdrops featuring an angular tiled roof reminiscent of traditional Korean architecture.\n \n Related article\nLook of the Week: Are we about to see more men in tights? \n In recent years, Blackpink have enjoyed a meteoric rise to global fame. According to Guinness World Records, they are currently the most streamed female group on Spotify, and have the most-viewed music YouTube channel. Last year, they were the first female K-Pop group to reach number 1 in the UK and US album charts, and in 2020 their track \"How You Like That\" became the most viewed video on YouTube in 24 hours. (The group also wore modernized hanboks, designed by Kim Danha, in one of the music video's scenes.) Their landmark set over the weekend was in fact a follow-up to another milestone: In 2019, they became the first female K-Pop group to ever play at Coachella or any other US festival.\n\n\n From the iconic Jean Paul Gaultier cone bra worn by Madonna for her 1990 Blond Ambition tour to Geri \"Ginger Spice\" Halliwell's Union Jack mini dress, the right stage costume can live on forever in public memory. Particularly when worn at a career-defining moment. During another watershed Coachella performance -- Beyonce's 2018 headline set -- the singer's custom Balmain collegiate-style yellow hoodie was a joyful nod to Black culture, specifically historically Black colleagues and universities.\n\n\n The group's four black hanboks were custom created by South Korean pattern design brand OUWR and traditional Korean dressmakers Kumdanje. Inspired by the Cheol-lik silhouette, each garment was hand-embroidered with metallic traditional Korean motifs, including dan-cheong patterns and peonies (a symbol of royalty in Korea). \"It was our pleasure and such an honor to be able to show the beautiful values of Korea and Hanbok together,\" the designers wrote in a combined Instagram post. \"Blackpink showed the beauty of Korea and dazzled the world.\"\n\n\n In Korea, hanboks are still worn for special occasions and often seen on TV dramas. Many designers in the country have also created contemporary takes that are incorporated into everyday wear. At Seoul Fashion Week, JULYCOLUMN's Fall-Winter 2023 collection drew on the hanbok's voluminous silhouette to create shirts and structured jackets. Last September, Korean label BlueTamburin brought the garment to a Western audience by exclusively using traditional hanbok fabric to create its Spring-Summer 2023 collection at Milan Fashion Week.\n \n Related article\nLook of the Week: 'Barbie' stars Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling hit the road in bubblegum pink \n Whether you're a devoted Blink or not, the looks marked a moment of Asian visibility, recognition of traditional craftsmanship and a powerful example of feeling seen through fashion -- representing Korean culture and symbolically embracing both its past and future.\n\n\n At the end of their performance, and having addressed the audience between numbers in English throughout their two-hour-long performance, Blackpink finished their set in Korean: \"Until now, it has been Jennie, Jisoo, Lisa, and Rose Blackpink. Thank you.\"\n \n Top image: Blackpink performing at the first weekend of Coachella 2023, shortly after removing their hanboks. \n (c) 2025 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

      "content": "Editor's Note: The views expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writers. CNN is showcasing the work of The Conversation, a collaboration between journalists and academics to provide news analysis and commentary. The content is produced solely by The Conversation. \n Hugh Hefner launched Playboy Magazine 70 years ago this year. The first issue included a nude photograph of Marilyn Monroe, which he had purchased and published without her knowledge or consent.\n\n\n Hefner went on to build the Playboy brand off the backs of the countless women featured in its pages, whose beauty and performance of heightened feminine sexuality have entertained its readers for generations.\n\n\n Approaching its 70th anniversary in December, Playboy has radically shifted. With the magazine no longer in publication, the Playboy Mansion sold to a developer and London's last remaining Playboy Club closing in 2021, what is the future for Playboy? The brand is changing to keep up with the post-#MeToo world.\n\n\n Hefner passed away one month before allegations against film producer Harvey Weinstein surfaced in 2017 giving momentum to the #MeToo movement (which saw survivors of sexual assault and harassment speak out against their abusers).\n \n READ MORE: Sex, love and companionship ... with AI? Why human-machine relationships could go mainstream \n In recent years, many have re-evaluated Hefner's legacy and relationships with women. The 2022 docuseries \"The Secrets of Playboy\" (which aired on Channel 4 in the UK) detailed sexual misconduct accusations against Hefner from several ex-girlfriends, including model Sondra Theodore and TV personality Holly Madison.\n\n\n Hefner and Playboy's relationship with women has been complicated. Playboy was an early supporter of abortion rights, helped fund the first rape kit and was at times an early proponent of inclusivity (for example featuring transgender model, Caroline \"Tula\" Cossey, in its June 1981 issue). But most women featured in Playboy have fit within a narrow beauty standard -- thin, white, able-bodied and blonde.\n\n\n Meanwhile Hefner's personal relationship with his much younger girlfriends reportedly followed patterns of control and emotional abuse. Ex-girlfriend Holly Madison described Hefner as treating her \"like a glorified pet\" in her 2015 memoir, \"Down the Rabbit Hole.\"\n\n\n Hefner's passing meant he evaded reckoning with the #MeToo movement. Playboy, however, responded, releasing a statement in which it affirmed support for the women featured in \"The Secrets of Playboy\" and called Hefner's actions \"abhorrent.\"\n\n\n The statement declared that the brand was no longer affiliated with the Hefner family and would be focusing on aspects of the company's legacy that align with values of sex positivity and free expression.\n \n READ MORE: The 'milf': a brief cultural history, from Mrs Robinson to Stifler's mom \n Today, Playboy is a very different company from the one Hefner launched nearly 70 years ago. Roughly 80% of Playboy staff identify as women, according the company, and its motto has changed from \"Entertainment for Men\" to \"Pleasure for All.\" Shares in the company are publicly traded and 40% of its board and management are women.\n\n\n The company has also moved towards more creator-led content through its app, Playboy Centerfold. Similar to subscription content service OnlyFans, Playboy Centerfold allows subscribers to view content from and interact with its creators, which it call \"bunnies.\"\n\n\n On the app, creators -- or bunnies -- are able portray their own bodies however they wish, putting the power back in their hands. Perhaps Playboy's future is no longer in serving the male gaze, but instead the very audience Hefner dismissed in his first letter from the editor:\n\n\n \"If you're a man between the ages of 18 and 80 Playboy is meant for you ... If you're somebody's sister, wife or mother-in-law and picked us up by mistake, please pass us along to the man in your life and get back to your Ladies Home Companion.\"\n\n\n The stars of Playboy's mid-2000s reality series, Holly Madison and Bridget Marquardt, are also enjoying a resurgence among fans.\n\n\n \"The Girls Next Door\" launched in 2004. The show focused on the lives of Hefner's three girlfriends, Madison, Marquardt and Kendra Wilkinson. It became E's best performing show and cultivated a new female audience for Playboy.\n\n\n \"The Girls Next Door\" was a story of complicated empowerment despite patriarchal interference. Its three female protagonists went from being known solely as some of Hefner's many blonde girlfriends, to celebrities in their own right.\n\n\n They each ultimately broke up with Hefner, leaving the Mansion and going on to lead successful careers.\n\n\n The show's depiction of Madison, Marquardt and Wilkinson as empowered, fun-loving and complex individuals, who found joy and agency through expressing their sexuality was perhaps what drew so many female fans to the show. However, amid the girls' fight for agency, Hefner retaliated.\n\n\n The series shows that he maintained final say in every Playboy photograph of the girls, as well as imposing strict curfews and spending allowances.\n\n\n In Madison and Wilkinson's memoirs, \"Down the Rabbit Hole,\" and \"Sliding into Home,\" they claim that production consistently undermined them. They refused to pay them for the first season, didn't credit them until season four and aired their uncensored nude bodies in foreign broadcasts and DVD releases without consent.\n \n READ MORE: #MeToo in space: We must address the potential for sexual harassment and assault away from Earth \n Fan interest in \"The Girls Next Door\" remains strong. In August 2022 Madison and Marquardt launched their podcast \"Girls Next Level,\" where they interview previous playmates and interact with fans. They also recap episodes from their own points of view, unpacking their experiences of working on the show.\n\n\n Having reached 10 million downloads as of February 2023, the success of the podcast -- 14 years after the last episode of \"The Girls Next Door\" -- speaks to the cultural legacy of the Playboy brand. It also shows that despite Hefner's original editor's note, Playboy resonates with some women.\n\n\n Playboy is now in a post-Hefner era, where the imagery of women found within old issues of Playboy can serve as inspiration for others to enjoy their own sexuality. Whatever the future has for the company, the concept of Playboy has become public property -- be that in the appearance of Playboy bunny costumes each Halloween, the popularity of cheeky Playboy logo tattoos or branded lingerie and clothing.\n\n\n In a post-#MeToo era, the women of Playboy are speaking up and taking over. With the mansion gates closed, the bunnies are finally reclaiming the brand as their own.\n \n Top Image: Hugh Hefner with Playboy \"bunnies\" in London in 1966. \n Daisy McManaman is a PhD Candidate at the Centre for Women's Studies, University of York.

      "content": " Now that the Fall-Winter 2023 catwalks have been disassembled, it's clear one trend was more pervasive than any collective penchant for ruffles, pleated skirts or tailored coats.\n\n\n Across runways in New York, London, Milan and Paris, there was a notable scarcity of plus-size models. This comes at a time when there are five injectable medications which can be used as appetite suppressants currently available by prescription in the US, stirring much conversation; a sixth medication, Rybelsus, is taken as an oral pill. Two are officially approved in the UK -- the largest influx of weight loss medication seen in the country in almost a decade.\n \n Related article\nDior's landmark Mumbai show signals India's growing luxury status \n In recent months, injectables such as Wegovy and Ozempic -- which share the same active ingredient, semaglutide -- have been widely reported as Hollywood's worst-kept weight loss secret. (Ozempic is intended for use primarily to treat Type 2 diabetes.) Comedian Chelsea Handler claimed her \"anti-aging doctor just hands (Ozempic) out to anybody\" while appearing on a podcast in January. Even Elon Musk tweeted last year about being on Wegovy.\n\n\n For many fashion commentators and diversity advocates, the Fall-Winter 2023 runways were in sharp contrast to the (albeit limited) progress and heady promise of recent seasons. This rollback has been widely criticized in the style media as such. And its potential impact is being assessed more broadly: With the rise of these weight loss panaceas, the pursuit of size zero is now just a prescription away.\n\n\n In 2020, Jill Kortleve and Paloma Elsesser became the first models outside of a sample size to walk for the Italian fashion house Fendi. (Traditionally, a sample size falls between a US 0-4.) British label Erdem entered the plus-size market in 2021, extending its offering to a UK size 22 (or US size 18). And in January 2022, Valentino made headlines after its haute couture show featured a broad spectrum of body types. But this season, there was a visible lack of curve bodies on their runways -- or many others.\n\n\n Fendi and Valentino did not respond when contacted by CNN, while Erdem declined to comment.\n\n\n According to fashion search engine Tagwalk, the number of mid and plus-size models dropped by 24% in comparison to Spring-Summer 2023. Similarly, a size inclusivity report conducted by Vogue Business found that 95.6% of all looks presented for Fall-Winter 2023 were in a size US 0-4. For context, industry market firm Plunkett Research estimated in 2015 that 68% of American women wear a size US 14 or above.\n\n\n \"It was a definitive backslide,\" said IMG model agent Mina White, who represents plus-size and curve supermodels including Elsesser and Ashley Graham. \"It was frustrating to see some of these designers not using curved bodies where they had in the past.\" Fendi and Valentino did not respond when contacted by CNN, while Erdem declined to comment.\n\n\n \"Watching somebody like Ashley Graham attend the front row for so many of these major houses in full looks (provided by the designer), it was frustrating,\" White continued. \"They wanted to utilize her image and her social following to command a certain space in the market, but they didn't want to be reflective on their runways.\"\n\n\n For others, even the term \"backslide\" was too generous. \"Slipping back from... what? A glorious time when the average American woman (size 16) was as present on the runways as she is in everyday life? A time when fashion ads cast as many 'plus-size' and 'mid-size' women as 'straight-size' women?\" fashion journalist Amy Odell wrote in her Substack newsletter of this past season's runways. \"No one needed any data to understand that representing a wide array of body shapes and sizes in runway shows or in fashion imagery is not a priority for the industry.\"\n\n\n That said, a handful of -- mostly smaller -- brands pushed ahead this season. In London, emerging labels Di Petsa, Karoline Vitto and Sinead O'Dwyer showcased lineups of size-diverse models. Inclusivity at Christian Siriano, Coach, Kim Shui, Collina Strada and Bach Mai stood out in New York; while in Paris, Belgian brand Esther Manas -- a consistent flag-bearer for size diversity -- staged one of the city's most refreshing runways with an assortment of fun, sensual, feminine looks that complimented a range of bodies.\n\n\n There was also a smattering of mid- and plus-size castings to be seen elsewhere: Off-White and Michael Kors, for example, featured a few such models. At Harris Reed's debut for Nina Ricci, Precious Lee opened the show -- which also featured three more plus- and mid-size models.\n\n\n Fashion samples and sample size pieces are one-off garments made before an item is mass-produced, typically to be worn during runway shows. Prioritizing the same body type in sample sizes means runway models are more easily interchangeable, saving fashion houses time and money if someone were to drop out or get sick during or after the casting process for a show.\n\n\n It's also partly why, according to White, casting curve models is still an uphill battle. She says she introduces brands to new faces months in advance of runway season, with their specific measurements up-top and easy to read in all correspondence. \"I want to be ahead of that,\" White said. \"So I'm never told 'Oh, we wanted to make it work, but we didn't have her size' or whatever that conversation might look like.\"\n \n Related article\nLook of the Week: What Pope Francis' AI puffer coat says about the future of fashion \n But despite her efforts, she says she's frequently told it's too much of a \"financial lift\" to make larger samples -- even by legacy brands. \"I get very upset when brands say that,\" White said. \"I don't believe that it is, I believe that it's people not being properly educated on how to do this right.\"\n\n\n Beyond the lack of representation, White notes it's painful for plus-size consumers to watch brands leverage resources to create custom, made-to-fit pieces for celebrities -- all the while claiming the pot is empty for more inclusive runway samples.\n\n\n London-based stylist and editor Francesca Burns agrees sample sizes are part of the problem. In 2020, Burns went viral after she posted on Instagram about a fashion job gone wrong. She says she was sent five looks to style from Celine, none of which fit the size UK 8 (US 4) model booked for the shoot-- an 18-year-old on her first job in the business. The experience left her \"horrified,\" Burns told CNN, recalling what she saw as the model's shame and embarrassment. \"Looking into this girl's eyes,\" Burns said, \"she shouldn't have felt like that.\"\n\n\n Burns' post, which called the current system \"unacceptable,\" was picked up widely in the fashion media. (When reached by CNN, Celine declined to comment on the incident.) \"Ultimately, the desire to see change has to be there,\" Burns said. \"And I wonder whether luxury has that desire?\"\n\n\n Progress has been slow, but not entirely inexistent. Across fashion campaigns, magazine covers and editorial shoots, there is a growing enthusiasm for inclusivity. \"I see the options rolling in for the plus-sized talent, and they're great offerings,\" said White. \"Great, strong editorials and covers and campaigns. But I do feel like without the clothes, we are going to go back to see more naked curve stories, or lingerie curve stories or a curve girl in a trench coat. That's what I don't want.\"\n\n\n For British Vogue's April issue, unveiled March 16, Elsesser, Lee and Jill Kortleve were dubbed \"The New Supers.\" Preceding the cover story is a letter written by editor-in-chief, Edward Enninful commending the models for \"leading the way\" and holding \"powerful space\" in the industry.\n\n\n \"Catwalks are once again under scrutiny for a stark lack of body diversity,\" read the magazine's Instagram caption, unveiling the cover. \"But this cover was not conceived as a statement. It is a crowning of an all-powerful trio, the supermodels for a new generation.\"\n\n\n But many online were quick to point out the disconnect: Two of the Saint Laurent Spring-Summer 2023 dresses were modeled by plus-size women, though they are not available to buy in most plus sizes.\n\n\n In his own social media post, Enninful wrote about his disappointment at the Fall-Winter 2023 runways. \"I thought I had gotten into a time machine. Show after show dominated by one body type, so many limited visions of womanhood... one prescribed notion of beauty prevailed again, and it felt like the reality of so many women around the world were being ignored.\"\n\n\n But for White, the power rests within the entire industry -- not just at the feet of brands. \"I really do believe there should be an industry standard between the (Council of Fashion Designers of America), the British Fashion Council and key editors at some of these major mass market magazines,\" she continued. \"If there was a call-to-action from these figureheads saying, moving forward samples need to be readily available for a few different body types, we would see significant and impactful change.\"\n\n\n Burns agrees there must be a trickle-down effect. \"I think a lot of responsibility is put on young designers to solve all these issues around sustainability or issues around body inclusivity,\" she said. \"It's important that the big powerhouses, which have the capacity to action change, really take some responsibility.\"\n\n\n On March 8, Wegovy -- developed primarily as a treatment for those living with obesity and weight-related conditions -- was approved in the UK. It's the second injectable weight management medication to be made available with a prescription via the country's National Health Service (NHS) in about 3 years, after almost a decade of quiet. Before 2020, the last weight loss medication was approved in the UK was in 2010.\n\n\n Similarly, the US has now approved three weight management injections: Wegovy, Saxenda and IMCIVREE. Medications for type-2 diabetes like Mounjaro and Ozempic are not FDA-approved for weight loss, though some doctors are issuing them at their own discretion.\n\n\n While these medicines are a revolutionary tool for those who struggle to lose weight for genetic or medical reasons, they are at risk of being abused.\n\n\n Semaglutide, the active ingredient in Wegovy and Ozempic, was originally developed for treating type-2 diabetes. It quells hunger signals to the brain by mimicking the hormone glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1). \"It can slow how quickly your stomach empties out and may give you a little more feeling of feeling full,\" said Dr. Robert Lash, an endocrinologist and Chief Medical Officer of the Endocrine Society in Washington, D.C. In clinical trials, over a period of 68 weeks, participants who used the medication in conjunction with eating fewer calories and increasing their physical activity on average lost around 15% of their body weight compared to 2.4% of those using a placebo, according to the manufacturer Novo Nordisk.\n\n\n On March 13, the European Medicines Agency issued a statement warning of an Ozempic shortage that could continue through the year, urging doctors to prioritize prescriptions to diabetics. \"Any other use, including for weight management, represents off-label use and currently places the availability of Ozempic for the indicated population at risk,\" read the release.\n\n\n Patients typically need a BMI of 27 or higher (along with another weight-related condition like high blood pressure or diabetes) or have a genetic predisposition towards obesity to be prescribed such appetite suppressant medication by their doctor. But talk of these injectables has been sweeping the West. In January, the New York Times reported on the term \"Ozempic Face,\" coined by a New York-based dermatologist who reported treating several patients with a hollowed-out appearance that can come with rapid weight loss. By the end of February, the medication had made it to the cover of New York Magazine in a feature titled \"Life After Food?\" Adverts for GLP-1 injections are even blanketing New York City subway stations.\n\n\n And across social media, online forums and private group chats, some people looking to lose weight for primarily aesthetic purposes are searching for a way to skirt the requirements.\n\n\n \"I was just looking for a way to lose a few pounds, like 10 to 15 at most,\" said one 30-year-old American woman, who wished to remain anonymous, in a phone interview. She scoured social media and forums for guidance on securing a weight loss drug. \"I'm certainly a normal BMI, I just have a trip to Mexico coming up and I want to look really good,\" she said.\n\n\n Although she says she found a way to access Wegovy, she decided against the medication after considering the cost (which can reach more than $1,000 a month without insurance). \"I've always very much fit the societal standard but lately I was just like f*ck it, I want to be skinny,\" she told CNN.\n\n\n Dr. Lash emphasized the importance of taking weight loss drugs only with medical supervision and a valid prescription. \"If somebody was a normal weight and they took this drug because they thought they could be even thinner than they are now, that could lead to complications,\" he told CNN, warning of nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and even gallbladder problems. \"These drugs are not benign, they do have side effects involving the GI tract. There's no such thing as a free lunch.\"\n\n\n Fashion has long promoted size 0 as the ultimate virtue -- regardless of its viability for many people, or any health risks. And now with the accessibility of accelerated weight loss medication, the stakes are even higher. For Burns and White, the industry is responsible for amplifying a new, more inclusive vision of beauty.\n\n\n \"There's a very archaic way of looking at women over a size 16 and just assuming that they're unhealthy or uneducated or unstylish. Or don't have the resources to buy into luxury,\" said White. \"The reality is the same women these brands are alienating in their fashion space are the same women running out to buy their handbags, shoes, perfumes, cosmetics and skincare.\"\n\n\n Not only do designers need to create clothes with this consumer in mind, according to White, but they need to be seen on the runway, too.\n\n\n \"It shouldn't be a conversation. It should just be normalized that we're not just looking at a single view of beauty,\" echoed Burns.\n\n\n Ester Manas and Balthazar Delepierre, whose bridal-inspired Fall-Winter 2023 collection was one of this season's most size-diverse runways, summarized it best in their accompanying show notes: \"The body is not the subject.

      "ml_hf_summary": "This article discusses the growing issue of inclusivity in fashion, particularly regarding body size and representation on runways. Here's a breakdown of the key points:\n\n**The Problem:**\n\n* **Limited Representation:**  Fashion has historically focused on very narrow beauty standards, often excluding women who are larger than a size 16.\n* **Impact on Consumers:** This exclusionary approach alienates a significant portion of potential customers and limits their access to luxury goods.\n* **Health Concerns:** The article highlights the dangers of using weight-loss medication for aesthetic purposes without medical supervision.\n\n**The Solutions:**\n\n* **Designers' Responsibility:**  Fashion designers need to create clothing that caters to a wider range of body types, not just the \"ideal\" size. \n* **Showcasing Diversity:**  Runway shows should feature models of diverse sizes and ethnicities to reflect the reality of consumers.\n* **Shifting Beauty Standards:** The industry needs to move away from narrow beauty ideals and embrace a more inclusive vision of beauty that celebrates all body types.\n\n**Key Quotes:**\n\n* \"There’s a very archaic way of looking at women over a size 16 and just assuming that they’re unhealthy or uneducated or unstylish. Or don’t have the resources to buy into luxury,\" - White\n* \"The body is not the subject. Because, obviously, at a wedding, everybody is invited. And all to the party. That is where the designer duo Ester and Balthazar take their stand.\" -  Ester Manas and Balthazar Delepierre\n\n**Overall:** The article emphasizes that fashion needs to evolve beyond its narrow focus on size and embrace inclusivity in both design and representation. This will not only benefit consumers but also contribute to a more diverse and representative industry overall. \n"

      "content": " Some people travel the world in search of adventure, while others seek out natural wonders, cultural landmarks or culinary experiences. But French photographer Francois Prost was looking for something altogether different during his recent road trip across America: strip clubs.\n\n\n From Miami to Los Angeles, Prost's latest book \"Gentlemen's Club\" charts his route across the US via nearly 150 strip clubs with names like Pleasures, Temptations and Cookies N' Cream. There isn't a single nude woman to be seen, however, as Prost's camera was exclusively trained on the buildings themselves -- and specifically their often-colorful facades.\n\n\n Over the course of five weeks in 2019 he traversed over 6,000 miles, with the resulting photos capturing everything from the pastel hues of Florida's Club Pink Pussycat to venues hiding in plain sight in the country's more religious states.\n\n\n \"I'd divide these venues into two types: One is very integrated into the public landscape, and one is a bit more hidden and dodgy,\" Prost said, speaking to CNN on a video call and email.\n\n\n The first type, he added, could be found in \"very American\" settings, such as \"around amusement parks and fast food and malls.\" The latter venues, however, would sometimes look indistinguishable from any store in a strip mall. Prost said he found many such establishments along the Bible Belt, a socially conservative region in the country's south. He was especially keen to explore the area due to the apparent contrast between the prevalence of strip clubs and what he describes in his book as \"conservatism and extreme puritanism.\"\n\n\n Prost insisted that he had little interest in the interiors or services of the strip clubs, which he always visited during the day. Instead, he hoped to learn more about American culture by creating objective, documentary-style photographs of establishments sitting at the intersection of sex, gender and commerce. Documenting changing attitudes toward sex through the lens of architecture, he added that the series was primarily of a landscape photography project.\n \n Related article\nArtful photos inside Houston's ONYX strip club tell a story of beauty and confidence \n \"The prism of this theme of strip club facades became a way of studying and trying to understand the country,\" he wrote in \"Gentlemen's Club,\" photographs from which will feature in an exhibition in Tokyo in March.\n\n\n \"('Gentlemen's Club' is) an objective panorama of dominant opinions and gender and the sexualization of the feminine image.\"\n\n\n The genesis of Prost's project dates back to his 2018 series, \"After Party,\" which focused on the flamboyant facades of French nightclubs. He said that people frequently commented that the buildings' exteriors looked as though they had been ripped straight out of American cities, sparking the idea that he should visit the US and extend the project.\n\n\n As he meticulously planned his trip, he was struck not only by the sheer volume of strip clubs in America but that -- unlike In Europe -- they often demanded to be seen. Hot pink walls, gigantic nude silhouettes and even candy-cane-striped storefronts made no secret of the kind of entertainment provided inside.\n \n Related article\nFrom Brutalist Boston to Modernist Palm Springs, America's most eye-catching city halls \n \"A good example would be Las Vegas, where strip clubs are everywhere and their signs blink as much as a fast food (restaurant) or casino sign,\" Prost said.\n\n\n Miami's clubs were often painted in vivid, Wes Anderson-esque hues. Other photos show brightly covered venues contrasting with their sparse desert surroundings.\n\n\n If the establishments were open during the day, Prost would enter and ask for permission to take photos in order \"to not look suspicious... and explain what my intentions were,\" he said. The interiors rarely lived up to the tantalizing promises plastered across the signs outside, but the photographer met a host of characters during his five-week trip, from indifferent bouncers to managers who were thrilled about the project.\n\n\n \"Most of the time, people were OK -- 99% of them would say yes to a facade picture,\" he said, adding they typically wouldn't mind his presence, as long as he didn't take photos of patrons or dancers.\n\n\n \"Some would think that it was a bit strange, some would be really excited about it and give me their business card to send me the picture when it was done,\" he said.\n\n\n Prost said his biggest surprise, however, was how \"normalized\" strip clubs appeared to be in everyday life. As he reflects in his book, \"The relationship that Americans seem to have with strip clubs is quite different to what you see in Europe. Going to a strip club seems to be a lot more normalized ... You go as a couple, or amongst friends at night to have fun.\"\n \n Related article\nGiant doughnuts and a shoe you can walk into: California's strangest buildings \n He was struck, for instance, by the fact that so many Las Vegas strip clubs doubled as restaurants -- with many boasting happy hour deals, buffets and special discounts for truck drivers or construction workers.\n\n\n \"I noticed a few strip clubs that would advertise being a strip club and steakhouse, so you could eat a big piece of meat (while) watching strippers. That is also something that seems very American to me,\" he said, adding: \"I heard from some people I met in Portland there are even strip clubs (that offer) vegan food.\"\n\n\n The facades are littered with jokes like \"My sex life is like the Sahara, 2 palms, no dates\" and pun-based names like Booby Trap and Bottoms Up. Prost's documentarian approach heightens the signs' surreal comedy. But it also doubles as a neutral lens through which viewers can make up their own minds about the objectification of women.\n\n\n By honing in on the faceless dancing bodies of female silhouettes and the quintessential \"girls girls girls\" signs, \"Gentleman's Club\" explores the commodification of women who are, in reality, completely absent in Prost's works (an observation reflected in the book's title, which is a phrase that crops up numerous times on signs throughout his photographs). The strip clubs he visited market women as things to be consumed, from the many food-themed names to an advertisement reading, \"1,000's of beautiful girls & three ugly ones.\"\n\n\n For his next project, Prost plans to visit Japan to document the nation's love hotels, which occupy a similar role as strip clubs in some parts of the US: open secrets in a conservative society. But the photographer believes the American establishments he visited say something unique about the country -- something that is less about sexuality and more about the American dream.\n \n Related article\nMuseum of Sex to open new outpost in Miami \n What his project has shown him is, he said, this: \"As long as you're successful in terms of business, (it doesn't matter) if your activity deals with sex.\"\n \n \"Gentlemen's Club\" will be exhibited at Agnes b.

      "content": "Editor's Note: The views expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writer. CNN is showcasing the work of The Conversation, a collaboration between journalists and academics to provide news analysis and commentary. The content is produced solely by The Conversation. \n We all know the routine by heart: \"Please ensure your seats are in the upright position, tray tables stowed, window shades are up, laptops are stored in the overhead bins and electronic devices are set to flight mode.\"\n\n\n Now, the first four are reasonable, right? Window shades need to be up so we can see if there's an emergency, such as fire. Tray tables need to be stowed and seats upright so we can get out of the row quickly. Laptops can become projectiles in an emergency, as the seat back pockets are not strong enough to contain them.\n\n\n And mobile phones need to be set to flight mode so they can't cause an emergency for the airplane, right? Well, it depends whom you ask.\n\n\n Aviation navigation and communication relies on radio services, which has been coordinated to minimize interference since the 1920s.\n\n\n The digital technology currently in use is much more advanced than some of the older analog technologies we used even 60 years ago. Research has shown personal electronic devices can emit a signal within the same frequency band as the aircraft's communications and navigation systems, creating what is known as electromagnetic interference.\n \n Related article\nHalf of the world's 10 busiest airports for 2022 are in one country \n But in 1992, the US Federal Aviation Authority and Boeing, in an independent study, investigated the use of electronic devices on aircraft interference and found no issues with computers or other personal electronic devices during non-critical phases of flight. (Takeoffs and landings are considered the critical phases.)\n\n\n The US Federal Communications Commission also began to create reserved frequency bandwidths for different uses - such as mobile phones and aircraft navigation and communications - so they do not interfere with one another. Governments around the globe developed the same strategies and policies to prevent interference problems with aviation. In the EU, electronic devices have been allowed to stay on since 2014.\n \n Related article\nWhat's the safest seat on a plane? We asked an aviation expert \n Why then, with these global standards in place, has the aviation industry continued to ban the use of mobile phones? One of the problems lies with something you may not expect - ground interference.\n\n\n Wireless networks are connected by a series of towers; the networks could become overloaded if passengers flying over these ground networks are all using their phones. The number of passengers that flew in 2021 was over 2.2 billion, and that's half of what the 2019 passenger numbers were. The wireless companies might have a point here.\n\n\n Of course, when it comes to mobile networks, the biggest change in recent years is the move to a new standard. Current 5G wireless networks - desirable for their higher speed data transfer - have caused concern for many within the aviation industry.\n\n\n Radio frequency bandwidth is limited, yet we are still trying to add more new devices to it. The aviation industry points out that the 5G wireless network bandwidth spectrum is remarkably close to the reserved aviation bandwidth spectrum, which may cause interference with navigation systems near airports that assist with landing the aircraft.\n\n\n Airport operators in Australia and the US have voiced aviation safety concerns linked to 5G rollout, however it appears to have rolled out without such problems in the European Union. Either way, it is prudent to limit mobile phone use on planes while issues around 5G are sorted out.\n\n\n Most airlines now provide customers with Wi-Fi services that are either pay-as-you-go or free. With new Wi-Fi technologies, passengers could theoretically use their mobile phones to make video calls with friends or clients in-flight.\n\n\n On a recent flight, I spoke with a cabin attendant and asked her opinion on phone use during flights. It would be an inconvenience for cabin crew to wait for passengers to finish their call to ask them if they would like any drinks or something to eat, she stated. On an airliner with 200+ passengers, in-flight service would take longer to complete if everyone was making phone calls.\n\n\n For me, the problem with in-flight use of phones is more about the social experience of having 200+ people on a plane, and all potentially talking at once. In a time when disruptive passenger behaviour, including \"air rage\", is increasingly frequent, phone use in flight might be another trigger that changes the whole flight experience.\n\n\n Disruptive behaviours take on various forms, from noncompliance to safety requirements such as not wearing seat belts, verbal altercations with fellow passengers and cabin crew, to physical altercations with passengers and cabin crews - typically identified as air rage.\n\n\n In conclusion - in-flight use of phones does not currently impair the aircraft's ability to operate. But cabin crews may prefer not to be delayed in providing in-flight service to all of the passengers - it's a lot of people to serve.\n\n\n However, 5G technology is encroaching on the radio bandwidth of aircraft navigation systems; we'll need more research to answer the 5G question regarding interference with aircraft navigation during landings. Remember that when we are discussing the two most critical phases of flight, takeoffs are optional - but landings are mandatory.\n \n Doug Drury is Professor, Head of Aviation, at Central Queensland University. \n Republished under a Creative Commons license from The Conversation.\n(c) 2025 Cable News Network.

      "content": " Paul Templer was living his best life.\n\n\n He was 28 and conducting tours in his native Zimbabwe, with a focus on photographic safaris.\n\n\n He had been away for a few years, including a stint in the British army. But he had returned to Africa's bush country \"and fell back in love with it. The wildlife, the flora, the fauna, the great outdoors, the space - just everything about it. I was at home.\"\n\n\n Templer said Zimbabwe's guide certification program was rigorous, and there was a lot of pride among the guides who passed. He reveled in showing tourists the area's majestic wildlife - including the water-loving, very territorial hippos.\n\n\n \"It was idyllic,\" he told CNN Travel. \"Life was really, really good - until one day I had a really bad day at the office.\"\n\n\n March 9, 1996. A Saturday. Templer learned a good friend who was to lead a canoe safari down the Zambezi River had malaria. He agreed to take his pal's place. \"I loved that stretch of the river. It was an area I know like the back of my hand.\"\n\n\n The expedition consisted of six safari clients (four Air France crewmembers and a couple from Germany), three apprentice guides plus Templer. They had three canoes - clients in the first two seats and a guide in the back. Then one apprentice guide was in a one-person safety kayak.\n\n\n And down the famed Zambezi they went. \"Things were going the way they were supposed to go. Everyone was having a pretty good time.\"\n\n\n Eventually, they came across a pod of about a dozen hippos. That's not unexpected on the Zambezi, Africa's fourth-longest river. They weren't alarmed at first as they were at a safe distance. But \"we were getting closer, and I was trying to take evasive action. ... The idea was let's just paddle safely around the hippos.\"\n\n\n Templer's canoe led the way, with the other two canoes and kayak to follow. He pulled into a little channel waiting on the others. But the third canoe had fallen back from the group and was off the planned course. Templer's not sure how that happened.\n\n\n Suddenly, there's this big thud. And I see the canoe, like the back of it, catapulted up into the air.\n\n\n Paul Templer\n\n\n \"Suddenly, there's this big thud. And I see the canoe, like the back of it, catapulted up into the air. And Evans, the guide in the back of the canoe, catapulted out of the canoe.\" The clients managed to remain in the canoe somehow.\n\n\n \"Evans is in the water, and the current is washing Evans toward a mama hippo and her calf 150 meters [490 feet] away. ... So I know I've got to get him out quickly. I don't have time to drop my clients off.\" He yells to Ben, one of the other guides, to retrieve the clients who were in the canoe that had been attacked.\n\n\n Ben got the clients to safety on a rock in the middle of the river that hippos couldn't climb.\n\n\n Meanwhile, Templer turned his canoe around to get Evans. The plan was to pull alongside of him and pull him into Templer's canoe.\n\n\n \"I was paddling towards him ... getting closer, and I saw this bow wave coming towards me. If you've ever seen any of those old movies with a torpedo coming toward a ship, it was kind of like that. I knew it was either a hippo or a really large crocodile coming at me,\" he said.\n\n\n \"But I also knew that if I slapped the blade of my paddle on water ... that's really loud. And the percussion underwater seems to turn the animals away,\" he said. \"So I slapped the water, and as it was supposed to do, the torpedo wave stops.\"\n\n\n He was getting closer to Evans, but they were also getting closer to the female and calf.\n\n\n \"I'm leaning over - it's kind of a made-for-Hollywood movie - Evans is reaching up. ... Our fingers almost touched. And then the water between us just erupted. Happened so fast I didn't see a thing.\"\n\n\n What happened next was nightmarish and surreal.\n\n\n \"My world went dark and strangely quiet.\" Templer said it took a few seconds to figure out what was going on.\n\n\n \"From the waist down, I could feel the water. I could feel I was wet in the river. From my waist up, it was different. I was warm, and it wasn't wet like the river, but it wasn't dry either. And it was just incredible pressure on my lower back. I tried to move around; I couldn't.\n\n\n \"I realized I was up to my waist down a hippo's throat.\"\n\n\n There's a good reason a fully grown hippopotamus can fit a large portion of a fully grown adult in its mouth. Hippos can grow up to 16.5 feet long (5 meters), 5.2 feet tall (1.6 meters) and weigh up to 4.5 tons (4 metric tonnes), according to National Geographic.\n\n\n They sport enormous mouths and can open their strong jaws to 150 degrees.\n\n\n Their teeth might be the most frightening thing of all. Their molars are used for eating plants, but their sharp canines, which might reach 20 inches (51 centimeters), are for defense and fighting. Their bite is almost three times stronger than that of a lion. One bite from a hippo can possibly cut a human body in half.\n\n\n They're found naturally in various parts sub-Saharan Africa, particularly in East and Southern Africa, living in or near rivers and other water sources. (And they are an invasive species in Colombia thanks to escapees from drug lord Pablo Escobar's menagerie).\n\n\n Hippos are very territorial and might aggressively attack any animal encroaching on their territory, including hyenas, lions and crocodiles.\n\n\n They also kill people. That we know for sure. Many internet sources say around 500 a year, but an exact figure is still uncertain because some attacks and deaths come in very remote regions and don't get reported.\n\n\n \"The question I get asked the most when people find out I study hippos is: 'Is it true hippos kill more people than any animal?' Rebecca Lewison, conservation ecologist and associate professor at San Diego State University, told CNN Travel in an email interview.\n \n Related article\nHow to survive a cobra bite -- or better yet, avoid one entirely \n \"I'm not entirely sure where that started but ... there is no authority or reliable data. People are surprised that hippos kill people. They look slow, and they are mostly in water. There are some nonfatal interactions, but people (or hippos) tend to fare badly from interactions.\"\n\n\n Dr. Philip Muruthi, chief scientist and vice president of species conservation and science of the African Wildlife Foundation, said the AWF doesn't have a credible source on the number of attacks or fatalities either.\n\n\n While more stats need to be collected, one study found that the probability of being killed by a hippopotamus attack is in the range of 29% to 87% - higher than that of a grizzly bear attack at 4.8%, shark attack at 22.7% and crocodile attack at 25%.\n\n\n Those were rather bad odds of survival working against Templer.\n\n\n \"I'm guessing I was wedged so far down its throat it must have been uncomfortable because he spat me out. So I burst to the surface, sucked a lungful of fresh air and I came face to face with Evans, the guide who I was trying to rescue. And I said, 'We got to get out of here!' \"\n\n\n So once again, I'm up to my waist down the hippo's throat. But this time, my legs are trapped but my hands are free.\n\n\n Paul Templer\n\n\n But Evans was in serious trouble. Templer started swimming back for him \"and I was just moving in for your classic lifesaver's hold when - WHAM! - I got hit from below. So once again, I'm up to my waist down the hippo's throat. But this time my legs are trapped but my hands are free.\"\n\n\n He tried to go for his gun, but he was being thrashed around so much he couldn't grab it. The hippo - which turned out to be an older, aggressive male - spat Templer out a second time.\n\n\n \"This time when I come to the surface I look around, there's no sign of Evans.\" Templer assumed Evans had been rescued, and he tried to escape himself.\n\n\n \"I'm making pretty good progress and I'm swimming along there and I come up for the stroke and swimming freestyle and I look under my arm - and until my dying day I'll remember this - there's this hippo charging in towards me with his mouth wide open bearing in before he scores a direct hit.\"\n\n\n This time, Templer was sideways in the hippo's mouth, legs dangling out one side of the mouth, shoulders and head on the other side of its mouth.\n\n\n \"And then he just goes berserk. ... When hippos are fighting, the way they fight is they try to tear apart and just destroy whatever it is they're attacking,\" Templer said.\n\n\n \"For me, fortunately everything was happening in slow motion. So when he'd go under water, I'd hold my breath. When we were on the surface, I would take a deep breath and I would try to hold onto tusks that were boring through me\" to stop from being ripped apart.\n\n\n Templer said one of the clients watching the horror later described it like a \"vicious dog trying to rip apart a rag doll.\"\n\n\n He figures the whole attack took about three and a half minutes.\n\n\n Meanwhile, apprentice guide Mack in the safety kayak - \"showing incredible bravery, risking his life to save mine - pulls his boat in inches from my face.\" Templer managed to grab a handle on the kayak, and \"Mack dragged me to the relative safety of this rock.\"\n\n\n The expedition was still in one hell of a mess, though.\n\n\n People living near hippo territory are more likely victims of attacks than tourists, said Lewison.\n\n\n \"Most of the attacks happen in the water, but because hippos raid crops on farms, there are also attacks on people trying to protect their crops. There are some tourists, but largely the attacks are happening to local residents,\" Lewison said.\n\n\n Human encroachment from Africa's booming population makes matters worse, increasing the chances of deadly interactions, she said.\n \n Related article\nYou encounter a bear in the wild. Do you know what to do next? \n Despite the encounters gone bad, sub-Saharan Africa depends on hippos.\n\n\n \"Hippos are important ecosystem engineers of the ecology of freshwater areas they inhabit. This is through nutrient recycling from dung (they consume large amounts of vegetation),\" Muruthi said.\n\n\n \"Hippos attack not to eat people, but to get them the hell away from them,\" Lewison said. \"I don't think hippos are particularly aggressive, but I think when under pressure, they attack.\"\n\n\n Back on the rock in the Zambezi, Templer asked Mack where Evans was. Mack said, \"He's gone, man, he's just gone.\"\n\n\n Templer knew he needed to come up with a plan to get them off the rock and to the riverbank, but \"first I needed to settle myself down.\"\n\n\n He assessed the situation: One man missing. The first aid kit, radio and gun all gone. Six scared clients, two canoes and one paddle left. And his own body was shattered.\n\n\n \"My left foot was especially bad; it looked as if someone had tried to beat a hole through it with a hammer.\" He couldn't move his arms. One arm from elbow down was \"crushed to a pulp.\"\n\n\n Blood was bubbling out of his mouth. They realized his lung was punctured. Mack rolled Templer over and could see a gaping hole in his back and plugged it with Saran Wrap from a plate of snacks.\n\n\n Templer made the call: No matter the risk, they had to get off that rock.\n\n\n He was loaded into a canoe. Ben paddled. The hippo kept bumping the canoe. He went from being terrified to calm on that ride back.\n\n\n He described \"a profound spiritual experience in which I had this incredible sense of peace and realization this was my moment of choice. Like do I go, or do I stay? Do I close my eyes and drift off, or do I fight my way through this and stick around?\"\n\n\n It was so intense I thought I was going to die, and when I didn't, I kind of wished I would.\n\n\n Paul Templer on the pain after the attack\n\n\n \"I chose to stick around, and as soon as I made that choice, it was more pain than I could ever imagine I could endure. It was so intense I thought I was going to die, and when I didn't, I kind of wished I would.\"\n\n\n Ben and Templer made it out of the river, but without finding Evans. His body was found three days later. They concluded he had drowned because he didn't have any signs of animal attack on him.\n\n\n \"Evans did nothing wrong. The fact that he died was purely a tragedy.\"\n\n\n Meanwhile, some people on shore had realized something was wrong in the river. A well-trained Zimbabwe rescue team was able to safely ferry everyone else off the rock.\n\n\n \"And that was my bad day at the office.\"\n\n\n Templer was out of the river but not out of the woods.\n\n\n It took eight hours to drive him to the nearest hospital. In a month's time, he had several major surgeries. He thought he would lose one leg and both arms. His surgeon didn't think he'd live.\n\n\n But not only did the surgeon save Templer's life, he saved his legs and one arm. The other arm, however, was beyond salvation.\n \n Related article\nIf you're attacked by an alligator, here's how to fight for your life \n He realized that in the ICU when he woke up and was feeling for his left hand. It was gone. \"I just remember feeling devastated. I spent my whole life being active and it was almost more than I could bare.\"\n\n\n But then he was flooded with relief to realize his right arm and legs had been saved. For the next month, he was \"emotionally all over the map.\"\n\n\n He got physical and occupational therapy in Zimbabwe and then more in the United Kingdom. He got a prosthesis \"and then just started trying to get back to life.\"\n\n\n Templer, Muruthi and Lewison all say safe outings start with education - and avoiding trouble in the first place.\n\n\n \"Hippos have no interest in dealing with people. Stay away from them, and they will leave you alone. They are not hunting humans,\" Lewison said.\n\n\n \"Do not get close to them,\" Muruthi said. \"They don't want any intrusion. ... They're not predators; it's by accident if they're injuring people.\"\n\n\n Want close-up views and photos of the creatures? Instead of venturing too close, invest in good binoculars and telephoto camera lenses.\n\n\n Follow the rules. If you are a tourist, and it says 'Stay in your vehicle,' then stay in your vehicle.\n\n\n Philip Muruthi on avoiding hippo attacks\n\n\n Do not walk along well-worn hippo paths, stay close to your group and don't approach them from behind, Muruthi said.\n\n\n \"Follow the rules. If you are a tourist, and it says 'Stay in your vehicle,' then stay in your vehicle. And even when you're in your vehicle, don't drive it right to the animal.\"\n\n\n Muruthi also advised that your party make some noise in areas known for hippos. \"It's good for them to know you're around.\"\n\n\n \"Hippos usually come out of water late in the evening and at night to forage, so avoid trekking along the river at that time,\" Muruthi said. Also stay on high alert during the dry season when food is scarce.\n\n\n Get to know the signs of disturbed hippos, Muruthi advised, in case you wander too closely. An agitated one will open its mouth wide and yawn as aggressive display. Also watch for a head thrown back, shaking of the head, grunting and snorting.\n\n\n \"These are signs you should have left already!\" Muruthi said.\n\n\n If you've attracted unwanted attention, Muruthi said to always remember you cannot outrun a hippo. They may look sluggish, but they can run 30 mph (almost 43 kph). Instead, you should try to climb a tree or find an obstacle to put between you and the hippo such as a rock or anthill.\n\n\n Muruthi, Lewison and Templer all said never stay between a hippo and the water. If it's charging you, run parallel to the water source. As with so many other protective female animals, never get between a mama hippo and her young, Templer said.\n \n Related article\nHe was alone, deep in the moutains. And a rattlesnake just bit him. \n What if you're in a small watercraft?\n\n\n \"Typically, if a hippo is going to be attacking, you'll see it coming way before. There will be that bow wave. ... If you slap the water, the percussion 99.9 times out of 100 will turn the hippo,\" Templer said. \"If you're in a canoe and a hippo knocks you in the water, get away from the canoe. The hippo is going for this big shape, getting it off its territory.\"\n\n\n It's also safer to view hippos on the water in a larger vessel, which the animal would have a harder time capsizing, Muruthi said.\n\n\n Unlike attacks by some other wild animals, humans are almost defenseless once an attack by a large hippo begins.\n\n\n \"Once attacked, there is nothing you can do,\" Muruthi said. \"Fight for dear life and watch for any chance to escape.\" He said you could try to poke at the eyes or any spot that might inflict unexpected pain. But given the size just of a hippo head, even that's a tall order.\n\n\n Hippos typically hole punch you, so there isn't much you can do if they get hold of you.\n\n\n Rebecca Lewison\n\n\n \"Hippos typically hole punch you, so there isn't much you can do if they get hold of you,\" Lewison said.\n\n\n Based on his attack, Templer said try not to panic \"when dragged underwater. Remember to suck in air if on the surface.\"\n\n\n Another hippo attack survivor in this National Geographic video also was able to conserve her breath. She also grabbed the hippo's snout, and one expert in the video theorizes that might have startled the hippo into letting her go.\n\n\n Two years after that attack, Templer said that he and a team made the longest recorded descent of the Zambezi River to date. It took three months and covered 1,600 miles (2,575 kilometers).\n\n\n How did Templer find the resilience to reclaim his life?\n\n\n After a particularly rough day trying to maneuver in a wheelchair, he said that his surgeon told him: \"You're the sum of your choices. You're exactly who, what and where you choose to be in life.\"\n\n\n Templer said he focused on what's possible vs. what he's lost. \"If you look for what's possible, it generally is.\"\n\n\n Templer later moved to United States; got married to the sister of a journalist on the record-setting Zambezi trip; wrote the book \"What's Left of Me\"; and is a speaker.\n\n\n Should people be afraid to even go on safari - especially in hippo areas - after learning of a harrowing story like Templer's?\n\n\n Muruthi said go, but go smartly. Be sure to get advice from professional tour guides - and then follow their guidance, Muruthi said. \"In Kenya, for example, contact the Kenya Professional Safari Guides Association,\" he said.\n\n\n Templer said his attack was an \"anomaly,\" and he doesn't want anyone to be dissuaded by what happened on his 1996 river run.\n\n\n \"My biggest counsel would be: Absolutely go and do it. But hook yourself up with someone who knows what they're doing out there. But by all means, go out ... and experience it.\"\n \n (c) 2025 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

      "content": "Editor's Note: Sign up for Unlocking the World, CNN Travel's weekly newsletter. Get the latest news in aviation, food and drink, where to stay and other travel developments. \n He'd spent years backpacking around the world, and Japanese traveler Daisuke Kajiyama was finally ready to return home to pursue his long-held dream of opening up a guesthouse.\n\n\n In 2011, Kajiyama arrived back in Japan with his Israeli partner Hila, who he met in Nepal, and the pair set about finding the perfect location for their future venture.\n\n\n However, there were a couple of major stumbling blocks in their way. To start with, Kajiyama had very little money to speak of after years of globetrotting around destinations like Korea, Taiwan, India, Nepal, Guatemala, Cuba and Canada.\n\n\n He also happened to have his heart set on a traditional Japanese house, typically known as kominka, which are usually passed down over generations.\n\n\n \"I wanted to have a traditional house in the countryside,\" Kajiyama tells CNN Travel, explaining that he was determined to find two houses located next to each other, so that he and Hila could live in one, while the other would be a guesthouse that they'd run together. \"I had a vision.\"\n \n Related article\nThis US couple bought and renovated a 14th-century Italian home \n When he was unable to find anything that met his requirements, Kajiyama decided to shift his search to include the growing number of abandoned homes in the country.\n\n\n As younger people ditch rural areas in pursuit of jobs in the city, Japan's countryside is becoming filled with \"ghost\" houses, or \"akiya.\"\n\n\n According to the Japan Policy Forum, there were 61 million houses and 52 million households in Japan in 2013, and with the country's population expected to decline from 127 million to about 88 million by 2065, this number is likely to increase.\n\n\n Kajiyama was driving around Tamatori, a small village located in the Shizuoka prefecture, between Kyoto and Tokyo, surrounded by green tea plantations and rice fields, when he came across an elderly woman farming, and decided to approach her.\n\n\n \"I said 'Do you know if there are any empty houses around here?' And she just pointed,\" he recalls.\n\n\n He looked over at the area that she was signaling to and spotted two neglected houses side by side - a former green tea factory and an old farmer's home - located close to a river.\n\n\n Both properties had been uninhabited for at least seven years and needed a huge amount of work. Kajiyama asked the woman to contact the owner to find out if they'd be interested in selling.\n\n\n \"The owner said that no one could live there, as it was abandoned,\" he says. \"But he didn't say 'no.' Everybody was always saying 'no.' But he didn't. So I felt there was a small chance.\"\n \n Related article\nExpats buy Japanese country house for a song and get way more than they bargained for \n Kajiyama returned to visit the houses around five times, before going to visit the owner himself to negotiate an agreement that would see him use the old green tree factory as a home, and convert the farmer's house into the guesthouse he'd always envisioned.\n\n\n While he was keen to purchase both of the homes, he explains that the traditions around home ownership in Japan mean that he is unable to do so until it's passed down to the son of the current owner.\n\n\n \"They said 'if you take all the responsibility yourself, you can take it.' So we made an agreement on paper,\" he says.\n\n\n Both he and Hila were aware that they had a lot of work ahead of them, but the couple, who married in 2013, were thrilled to be one step closer to having their own guesthouse in an ideal spot.\n\n\n \"It's a very nice location,\" says Kajiyama. \"It's close to the city, but it's really countryside. Also people still live here and go to work [in the city].\n\n\n \"The house is also in front of the river, so when you go to sleep you can hear the sound of the water.\"\n\n\n According to Kajiyama, the process of clearing the house, which is around 90 years old, before beginning the renovation works was one of the hardest parts of the process, simply because there was so much stuff to sort through. However, he was able to repurpose some of the items.\n\n\n During the first year, he spent a lot of time connecting with locals, gaining knowledge about the home, and helping the local farmers with farming for the first year or so.\n\n\n Although he wasn't hugely experienced with renovation work, he had spent some time farming and completing building while he was backpacking, and had also taken odd jobs fixing peoples homes.\n\n\n He completed much of the work on the guesthouse himself, replacing the floors and adding in a toilet, which he says was a wedding present from his parents, at a cost of around $10,000.\n\n\n \"I'm not really a professional,\" he says.\" I like to do carpentry and I enjoy creating things, but I have no experience in my background.\n\n\n \"From my several years of backpacking, I saw so many interesting buildings, so many houses of interesting shapes and I've been collecting those in my brain.\"\n\n\n Kajiyama was determined to keep the house as authentic as possible by using traditional materials.\n\n\n He saved money by collecting traditional wood from building companies who were in the process of breaking down traditional houses.\n\n\n \"They need to spend the money to throw it away,\" he explains. \"But for me, some of the stuff is like treasure. So I would go and take the material that I wanted.\n\n\n \"The house is a very, very old style,\" he says. \"So it wouldn't look nice if I brought in more modern materials. It's totally authentic.\"\n\n\n He explains that very little work had previously been done to the house, which is quite unusual for a home built so many years ago.\n\n\n \"It's totally authentic,\" he says. \"Usually, with traditional houses, some renovations are made to the walls, because the insulation is not so strong. So you lose the style.\"\n\n\n He says he received some financial support from the government, which meant he was able to bring in a carpenter and also benefited from Japan's working holiday program, which allows travelers to work in exchange for food and board, when he needed extra help.\n\n\n After doing some research into Japanese guesthouse permits, he discovered that one of the simplest ways to acquire one would be to register the property as an agriculture guesthouse.\n\n\n As the area is filled with bamboo forests, this seemed like a no-brainer, and Kajiyama decided to learn everything he could about bamboo farming so that he could combine the two businesses.\n\n\n \"This is how I started farming,\" he says.\n\n\n In 2014, two years after they began working on the house, the couple were finally able to welcome their first guests.\n\n\n \"It was a beautiful feeling,\" says Kajiyama. \"Of course, this was my dream. But people really appreciate that it was abandoned and I brought it back to life.\"\n\n\n He says that hosting guests from all over the world has helped him to stay connected to his former life as a backpacker.\n\n\n \"I stay in one place, but people come to me and I feel like I'm traveling,\" he says. \"Today, it's Australia, tomorrow it's the UK and next week South Africa and India.\n\n\n \"People come from different places and they invite me to join them for dinner, so sometimes I join someone's family life.\"\n\n\n Sadly, Hila passed away from cancer in 2022. Kajiyama stresses that his beloved wife played a huge part in helping him achieve his dream of having a guesthouse and says he couldn't have done it without her.\n\n\n \"We were really together,\" he adds. \"She created this place with me. Without her it would not have been like this.\"\n\n\n While the three-bedroom guesthouse, which measures around 80 square meters, has been open for around eight years, Kajiyama is still working on it, and says he has no idea when he'll be finished.\n\n\n \"It's never ending,\" he admits. \"I'm halfway, I feel. It is beautiful already. But it started off abandoned, so it needs more details. And I'm getting better at creating, so I need time to do it.\"\n\n\n He explains that he's unable to complete work on the home while guests are there. And while the property is closed during the winter, he spends two months as a bamboo farmer and usually spends a month traveling, which doesn't leave him much time for renovations.\n\n\n \"Sometimes I don't do anything,\" he admits.\n\n\n Yui Valley, which offers activities such as bamboo weaving workshops, has helped to bring many travelers to the village of Tamatori over the years.\n\n\n \"Most of the guests come after Tokyo, and it's such a contrast,\" he says. \"They are really happy to share the nature and the tradition in our house.\n\n\n \"Most people have dreamed of coming to Japan for a long time and they have a very short time here.\n\n\n \"So they have such a beautiful energy. I'm happy to host in this way and join their holiday time. It's very special [for me].\"\n\n\n Kajiyama estimates that he's spent around $40,000 on the renovation work so far, and if the feedback from guests, and locals, is anything to go by, it seems to have been money well spent.\n\n\n \"People appreciate what I've done,\" he adds. \"So that makes me feel special.\"\n\n\n As for Hiroko, the woman who pointed out the house to him over a decade ago, Kajiyama says she's stunned at the transformation, and is amazed at how many international travelers are coming to Tamatori to stay at Yui Valley.\n\n\n \"She cannot believe how much more beautiful it is [now],\" he says. \"She didn't think it was going to be like this. So she really appreciates it. She says 'thank you' a lot.\"\n \n Yui Valley, 1170 Okabecho Tamatori, Fujieda, Shizuoka 421-1101, Japan \n (c) 2025 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros.

      "content": "Editor's Note: This CNN Travel series is, or was, sponsored by the country it highlights. CNN retains full editorial control over subject matter, reporting and frequency of the articles and videos within the sponsorship, in compliance with our policy. \n Due to its remoteness and short summer season, Mongolia has long been a destination overlooked by travelers.\n\n\n But as the country moves to further open up to tourism by easing its entry conditions for international visitors and upgrading its infrastructure, 2023 might just be the best time yet to get there.\n\n\n Here are 10 reasons travelers should start planning their long-dreamed-of Mongolia visit now.\n\n\n With the government of Mongolia declaring 2023 through 2025 the \"Years to Visit Mongolia,\" citizens from an additional 34 countries can now visit the country visa-free through the end of 2025.\n\n\n The addition of several European countries, including Denmark, France, Greece, Italy, Norway, Spain, and the UK, as well as Australia and New Zealand, now brings the total number of countries and territories on the visa-exempt list to 61.\n\n\n The full list is here.\n\n\n After years of delays, a pandemic and several controversies, the newly built Chinggis Khaan International Airport finally opened in the summer of 2021.\n\n\n With the ability to handle approximately 3 million passengers a year (double that of the old airport), the addition of 500 new aircraft parking spaces and the infrastructure to support an increase in domestic as well as budget flights, the airport is a welcome addition to the country's efforts to grow tourism.\n\n\n Budget flights to Hong Kong from EZNIS Airways have been relaunched since the airport's opening, and talks to resume direct flights to the United States are reportedly underway.\n\n\n The recently opened Chinggis Khaan Museum offers a beautiful, fresh look at Mongolia's tumultuous history.\n\n\n With more than 10,000 artifacts spanning over 2,000 years, the museum explores the history of the Mongols and the empire they created - and eventually lost.\n\n\n The museum's artifacts are presented over eight floors, with six permanent and two temporary exhibition halls. Guided tours are offered in English every Saturday and Sunday from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. free of charge.\n\n\n When most people think of Mongolia, music festivals and conservation-focused art installations in the heart of one of the world's largest deserts are the last things to come to mind.\n\n\n But that's all changing thanks to festivals like Playtime, Spirit of Gobi, INTRO Electronic Music Festival and the Kharkhorum 360 Visual Art & Music Experience.\n\n\n Placing international bands, DJs, and musicians from around the world alongside Mongolia's eclectic mix of rappers, bands and folk singers, the country just might be one of the world's most underrated places for festival lovers.\n\n\n The annual Naadam event has always been a great reason to visit Mongolia, but now that the festival has just celebrated its 100 year anniversary, 2023 is as good a time as ever to attend.\n\n\n While the festival's origins are rooted in the days of Genghis Khan, when he used horse racing, wrestling and archery competitions to keep his warriors in shape between battles, Naadam only officially became a national holiday 100 years ago.\n\n\n Today, the festival - held in Ulaanbaatar at the National Sports Stadium, has a few more bells and whistles than it did during the days of the Great Khan.\n\n\n A seat at July 11's opening ceremony is always one of the hardest tickets to score in town.\n\n\n Mounted archery is seeing a resurgence in Mongolia thanks to guys like Altankhuyag Nergui, one of the most accomplished archers in the sport and his archery academy, Namnaa.\n\n\n Here, locals learn the fundamentals of Mongolian archery before mounting a horse and taking their new found skills to another level.\n\n\n In the summer months, students and academy members put on weekly shows for interested spectators. The academy also offers day-long training sessions for those wanting to try this intense sport.\n\n\n Speaking of giving life to Mongolia's most ancient traditions, the resurrection of Mongol bichig, or the traditional Mongolian script written from top to bottom and read from left to right, has also seen a major resurgence in recent years.\n\n\n Visit the Erdenesiin Khuree Mongolian Calligraphy Center in Karakorum to learn from master calligraphist Tamir Samandbadraa Purev about this important cultural heritage. And, while you're there, browse the yurts filled with Tamir's works.\n\n\n Pair the release of Husqvarna's new Norden 901 Expedition motorbike with Nomadic Off-Road's newly announced Eagle Hunter Tour, and you have one of the fastest adventures in Mongolia.\n\n\n The tour takes six riders 1,700 kilometers from Ulaanbaatar to Bayan-Ulgii, where riders eventually meet their hosts, Mongolia's famous eagle hunters.\n\n\n The only thing faster than this adventure is the rate at which Nomadic Off-Road's tours sell out.\n \n Related article\nCapturing the art of the last eagle hunters of Mongolia \n Professional musher Joel Rauzy has been leading dogsledding tours across the frozen Lake Khuvsgul for 18 years.\n\n\n With fewer crowds, lower hotel rates and the chance to see one of the largest freshwater lakes in the world completely frozen over, winter in Mongolia is something else to see and experience.\n\n\n Rauzy's company, Wind of Mongolia, offers tours of the lake, where each person is assigned their own sled and dogs for the journey. Following Rauzy's lead, mushers will make a loop of the lake. Activities include ice fishing, while travelers stay in winterized yurts and spend time with nomadic families along the journey.\n\n\n Nestled in the heart of Selenge province on the Yeruu River, Yeruu Lodge is the brainchild of Norwegian founder Eirik Gulsrud Johnsen, who first visited Mongolia in 2017.\n\n\n With a minimal Scandinavian-style restaurant and dining area, a handful of fully kitted out yurts for guests to stay in, two petanque courts, kayaks, a driving range, mountain bikes and a yoga area, the lodge is a destination for nature lovers.\n\n\n Completely off-grid, the lodge runs off solar panels, uses of thermal heating, and all of the property's water comes from an on-property well and is recycled after use.\n\n\n Additionally, all glass, metal and plastic used at the lodge is also recycled, and food waste is turned into compost used to grow vegetables, berries and herbs onsite.\n\n\n The lodge is set to open in April 2023.\n \n (c) 2025 Cable News Network.

      "content": "Editor's Note: Monthly Ticket is a CNN Travel series that spotlights some of the most fascinating topics in the travel world. In September, we're celebrating superlatives as we look at some of the world's biggest, tallest and most expensive attractions and destinations. \n Having lived in Beijing for almost 12 years, I've had plenty of time to travel widely in China.\n\n\n I've visited more than 100 cities, not to mention countless towns and villages throughout the mainland's 31 provinces.\n\n\n Looking back, I've come to realize it was my frequent visits to different parts of the Great Wall in Beijing that were a driving force behind my desire to explore the rest of the country and, along with it, the many sections of wall that lie outside the capital's boundaries.\n\n\n Work on the Great Wall began more than 2,500 years ago, its origins dating back to China's Spring and Autumn Period of around 770 BCE to 476 BCE. Various sections were added in subsequent eras as competing dynasties and factions sought to exert their control.\n\n\n Work eventually stopped in the 17th century.\n \n Related article\nWhat's it like to walk the entire length of China's Great Wall? \n Though not a single, unbroken structure, the wall spans over 21,000 kilometers, winding through 15 provinces, 97 prefectures and 404 counties.\n\n\n And while certain sections have been incredibly popular among tourists, many parts have slipped into obscurity, disrepair and sometimes oblivion.\n\n\n Whether you're planning to visit the Great Wall for the first time or the 50th, the following destinations are sure to make your trip to China even more worthwhile. (Check out the above video for dramatic aerial footage of some of these amazing sites.)\n\n\n The Great Wall is not simply a brick and mortar bulwark; in certain places, towers on jagged mountain peaks, fortress towns or even wide rivers count as sections of \"wall.\"\n\n\n The Turtle City, built in the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644) as part of the Great Wall's \"Yellow River Defense Line,\" was completed in 1608 and was home to around 2,000 infantrymen and 500 cavalry units during peak use.\n\n\n Today, this fortress city is located in the Sitan Township of Jingtai County in north central Gansu province.\n\n\n While there aren't many real turtles in the \"Turtle City,\" the garrison town got its nickname due to its unique shape.\n\n\n The south gate acts as the head and the west and east gates as the flippers. The town's oval wall is the body, while the north gate acts as its tail. As one of the most well-preserved and truly authentic walled cities left in China today, it's definitely worth your time.\n\n\n Staying in the Jingtai County center is recommended. The ancient city is only a 30-minute cab ride from your lodgings, so you can visit whenever the light is best for photos.\n\n\n When in Jingtai, try local specialties such as the five Buddha tofu and the Jingtai cold mixed noodles - both are spicy vegetarian dishes. A walk through the sprawling night market in Jingtai County People's Square, which boasts more than 50 snack stalls, is also recommended for adventurous foodies.\n \n Related article\nRegional Chinese food: 8 lesser-known cuisines worth trying \n Getting there: Lanzhou, the capital of Gansu province, has a major international airport and high-speed train connections from many cities in China. The drive to Yongtai Turtle City from downtown Lanzhou takes about 2.5 hours (195 kilometers). From Lanzhou Zhongchuan Airport, it's only 1.5 hours (125 kilometers). \n Mutianyu and Jiankou are two parts of the same Stone Dragon - two contiguous sections of the Great Wall that together stretch for roughly 25 kilometers along Beijing's mountaintops.\n\n\n Historical records show that millions of men spent centuries constructing the Great Wall. Stand atop the wall at either Mutianyu or Jiankou, and you'll begin to comprehend the gravity of this statement.\n\n\n These two sections are arguably the two most classic examples of Ming Dynasty Great Wall surviving today, and climbing either is guaranteed to be a life-changing experience.\n\n\n Mutianyu is the best portion of the \"tourist wall.\" Restored in the 1980s, it's very commercial but also superbly beautiful. Visitors not up for the hike can take a cable car to the top.\n \n Related article\nOff-the-radar destinations every visitor to China should consider \n To the west of Mutianyu, Jiankou is colloquially known as the \"wild wall\" - no ticket needed and not commercialized. That being said, as of 2020, hiking at Jiankou has become somewhat frowned upon by the local government because of safety concerns.\n\n\n Mutianyu and Jiankou are less than a 90-minute drive (without traffic) from downtown Beijing, yet it's highly recommended to enjoy a night in the countryside if time allows.\n\n\n Jiankou can be accessed via Xizhazi village; if dates align, you might even be able to spend a few days with William Lindesay, world-renowned Great Wall historian, and his wonderful family at The Barracks, their wall-side courtyard home.\n\n\n For lodgings around Mutianyu, The Brickyard is a superbly comfortable choice.\n\n\n In fall and spring, shades of the wall's gray brick contrast with nature's vibrant colors. Peak autumn foliage and spring cherry blossoms provide stunning backdrops for photos.\n\n\n For winter sports enthusiasts, there's skiing and skating next to the Wall at locations not far from Mutianyu.\n \n Getting to Mutianyu: Restrictions on applying for temporary driving licenses in China were relaxed in September 2019, so renting a car as a foreign tourist is entirely possible. (International driving licenses are not accepted in China.) \n You can also hire a car with a driver for the day or take the Mutianyu Special Tourism Bus from the Dongzhimen Wai Bus Station.\n \n Getting to Jiankou: Renting a car or booking private transport is recommended. As Xizhazi is a small village, buses are scarce so it can take up to five hours to get there by public transport, as opposed to 90 minutes by car. \n Bataizi village sits just inside the Motianling section of the Great Wall and is home to the ruins of a Gothic church built in 1876 under the direction of a German missionary.\n\n\n The church has been damaged and repaired numerous times in its nearly 150-year history; the bell tower is the only part still standing.\n\n\n The juxtaposition of its ruins against the rammed-earth Great Wall makes Bataizi a unique place to spend a morning or afternoon.\n \n Related article\nChina's best new outdoor attractions \n After finishing your hike along the wall and visiting the church ruins, drop in to the village's \"new\" church to say hello to Father Pan; if you speak Chinese, he can answer any questions about the village's long connection with Catholicism.\n\n\n Besides Bataizi, Datong should also be on your tourist map; visiting the Yungang Grottoes (a UNESCO world heritage site) and the Hengshan Hanging Temple will make your trip even more memorable.\n\n\n Late summer is an ideal time to visit Bataizi, as you'll see a wonderful contrast between the Great Wall and the lush green hills.\n \n Getting there: Bataizi village is 80 kilometers west of Datong, one of Shanxi province's largest and most famous cities. Zuoyun County is only 22 kilometers away from Bataizi - about a 35-minute drive. \n Datong is easily accessible by plane or high-speed train from other cities in China; a taxi from downtown Datong to Bataizi should cost roughly 300 yuan (about $43).\n\n\n Alternatively, you can make your way to Zuoyun County by bus then hop in a taxi.\n\n\n In Datong, luxury seekers will want to head for the five-star Yunzhong Traditional Courtyard Hotel. Zuoyun County has one hotel that can accept foreigners: Zuoyun Jinshan International Hotel. Both can be found on popular hotel booking sites.\n\n\n As the locals say, Laoniuwan is where the Great Wall and the mighty Yellow River shake hands.\n\n\n The Laoniuwan Fortress was built in 1467, while the most famous tower of the Great Wall in this area, Wanghe Tower (literally meaning river-watching tower), was constructed in 1544.\n\n\n Laoniuwan village is located in Pianguan County, part of Xinzhou city in Shanxi province, just across the river from Inner Mongolia.\n\n\n Late summer or early fall is a great time to visit, as you'll avoid the potentially dangerous mountain roads during spring rainstorms, or being uncomfortably cold in a place without great infrastructure.\n\n\n Along the Great Wall, there are only a few places where it meets bodies of water; of all those, this is the most stunning.\n\n\n A boat ride along the river is highly recommended. You'll be able to soak in the natural beauty of the Yellow River Gorge while marveling at the steadfast resolve of these ancient architects.\n \n Related article\nSwell life: China's surf scene is heating up \n Getting there: Laoniuwan is difficult to get to by public transportation. The best option is to rent or book a car to take you from Datong to Laoniuwan via Bataizi - this way, you'll be able to see two incredible locations along the Great Wall in one trip. \n Pianguan is the nearest city, about one hour away. Pianguan does not have a train station or an airport. The only option is to arrive by bus. Shuozhou, 140 kilometers from Laoniuwan, has an airport opening later this year.\n\n\n Construction on the Great Wall in Simatai began in 1373. It was expanded and reinforced periodically throughout the Ming Dynasty.\n\n\n The Fairy Tower is one of the best-known towers of the wall at Simatai but also one of the least visited due to how difficult it is to access.\n\n\n Instead, aim to take in incredible views of the Fairy Tower from Wangjing Tower (just a few hundred meters away). It's a journey that will satiate even the most adventurous hikers, yet can be done without any ropes, ladders or other essential safety gear.\n\n\n As with a visit to Mutianyu/Jiankou, this section of wall is guaranteed to deliver stunning views any time of year. My only suggestion is to wait for a clear day (usually visibility is great the day after it rains or snows), as the view from Wangjing Tower is unobstructed in every direction.\n\n\n The hike to the Fairy Tower will leave you in awe of the Northern Barbarians' supposed determination to reach the capital; the mountains are nearly impassable on foot, let alone by horse, with sheer cliff faces on either side.\n\n\n It makes for absolutely world-class hiking and an interesting history lesson.\n\n\n Five-star lodgings are available at Hobo Farm; they also have an incredible restaurant that serves delicious Western and Chinese fare. For 4.5 star lodgings with a lower price tag, try Yatou's Homestay. Both can be found on major hotel booking sites.\n \n Getting there: Both the Fairy Tower and Wangjing Tower should be accessed via Tangjiazhai village, located in Beijing's Miyun district. \n Tangjiazhai village is 140 kilometers from downtown Beijing, depending on your route. Booking a private car from the city is probably the most time-effective way to get there.\n\n\n You can also take a high-speed train from Beijing Station to Miyun district and switch to a bus or taxi from there.\n\n\n Constructed during the reign of Emperor Jiajing (1507-1567), this single-wall section stands seven meters tall in some spots - no small feat considering it was made by piling stones.\n\n\n It's located just across the road from the town of Dushikou, in Chicheng in Hebei province.\n\n\n The piled-stone wall at Dushikou is unique, as many other sections of the Great Wall close to Beijing were constructed using kiln-fired bricks.\n\n\n Dushikou is best visited in the summer, specifically July and August, when the rolling hills of the surrounding grasslands are peak green. Cool evenings make for perfect outdoor barbecue/bonfire weather.\n\n\n You'll be able to find clean and comfortable farmhouse lodgings in Dushikou town; alternatively, Chicheng, 45 minutes away, has a range of hotels to choose from.\n\n\n Lamb skewers and roast leg of lamb are specialties in these parts, as this part of Hebei is very close to the border with Inner Mongolia. Noodle lovers should also try the local oat noodles, which are delicious.\n \n Getting there: Thanks to all the infrastructure built for the 2022 Winter Olympics, the drive to Dushikou has been shortened by almost two hours. If you prefer not to drive, hop on a bus to Chicheng from the Liuliqiao Transport Hub in Beijing and take a 45-minute taxi ride to Dushikou. \n Note that public transportation will take one or two hours longer than private car.\n \n (c) 2025 Cable News Network.

      "content": "Nelly Cheboi, who in 2019 quit a lucrative software engineering job in Chicago to create computer labs for Kenyan schoolchildren, is the 2022 CNN Hero of the Year. \n Related gallery\nInside 2022's 'CNN Heroes: An All-Star Tribute' \n Online voters selected her from among this year's Top 10 CNN Heroes.\n\n\n Cheboi's nonprofit, TechLit Africa, has provided thousands of students across rural Kenya with access to donated, upcycled computers -- and the chance at a brighter future.\n\n\n Cheboi accepted the award with her mother, who she said \"worked really hard to educate us.\" At the beginning of her acceptance speech, Cheboi and her mother sang a song onstage that she explained had a special meaning when she was growing up.\n\n\n As CNN Hero of the Year, Cheboi will receive $100,000 to expand her work. She and the other top 10 CNN Heroes honored at Sunday's gala all receive a $10,000 cash award and, for the first time, additional grants, organizational training and support from The Elevate Prize Foundation through a new collaboration with CNN Heroes. Nelly will also be named an Elevate Prize winner, which comes with a $300,000 grant and additional support worth $200,000 for her nonprofit.\n\n\n Cheboi grew up in poverty in Mogotio, a rural township in Kenya. \"I know the pain of poverty,\" said Cheboi, 29. \"I never forgot what it was like with my stomach churning because of hunger at night.\"\n\n\n A hard-working student, Cheboi received a full scholarship to Augustana College in Illinois in 2012. She began her studies there with almost no experience with computers, handwriting papers and struggling to transcribe them onto a laptop.\n \n Related article\nThis CNN Hero upcycles old computers to open new worlds for young Kenyans \n Everything changed in her junior year, though, when Cheboi took a programming course required for her mathematics major.\n\n\n \"When I discovered computer science, I just fell in love with it. I knew that this is something that I wanted to do as my career, and also bring it to my community,\" she told CNN.\n\n\n Many basic computer skills were still a steep learning curve, however. Cheboi remembers having to practice touch-typing for six months before she could pass a coding interview. Touch-typing is a skill that is now a core part of the TechLit curriculum.\n\n\n \"I feel so accomplished seeing kids that are 7 years old touch-typing, knowing that I just learned how to touch-type less than five years ago,\" she said.\n\n\n Once she had begun working in the software industry, Cheboi soon realized the extent of which computers were being thrown away as companies upgraded their technology infrastructure.\n \n Related video\nWatch Sofia Carson perform 'Applause' at CNN Heroes celebration \n \"We have kids here (in Kenya) -- myself included, back in the day -- who don't even know what a computer is,\" she said.\n\n\n So, in 2018, she began transporting donated computers back to Kenya -- in her personal luggage, handling customs fees and taxes herself.\n\n\n \"At one point, I was bringing 44 computers, and I paid more for the luggage than I did for the air ticket,\" she said.\n\n\n A year later, she co-founded TechLit Africa with a fellow software engineer after both quit their jobs. The nonprofit accepts computer donations from companies, universities and individuals.\n\n\n The hardware is wiped and refurbished before it's shipped to Kenya. There, it's distributed to partner schools in rural communities, where students ages 4 to 12 receive daily classes and frequent opportunities to learn from professionals, gaining skills that will help improve their education and better prepare them for future jobs.\n\n\n \"We have people who own a specific skill coming in and are just inspiring the kids (with) music production, video production, coding, personal branding,\" Cheboi said. \"They can go from doing a remote class with NASA on education to music production.\"\n\n\n The organization currently serves 10 schools; within the next year, Cheboi hopes to be partnered with 100 more.\n\n\n \"My hope is that when the first TechLit kids graduate high school, they're able to get a job online because they will know how to code, they will know how to do graphic design, they will know how to do marketing,\" Cheboi said. \"The world is your oyster when you are educated. By bringing the resources, by bringing these skills, we are opening up the world to them.\"\n\n\n CNN's Anderson Cooper and ABC's Kelly Ripa co-hosted the 16th Annual \"CNN Heroes: An All-Star Tribute,\" which featured more than a dozen celebrity presenters.\n\n\n \"We're so deeply honored to be here,\" said actress and singer Sofia Carson, who perfomed a song with award-winning songwriter Diane Warren at the event. \"Diane wrote this incredible anthem 'Applause' for those leading, surviving and fighting and tonight we dedicate this song and performance to our heroes.\"\n\n\n Actor Aubrey Plaza introduced CNN Hero Aidan Reilly, who launched his nonprofit while home from college during the early months of the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\n\n \"From his pandemic couch, Aidan and his friends co-founded Farmlink Project,\" Plaza said. The nonprofit connects excess food from farms across the US - food that would otherwise be wasted - to those who need it. \"In just two years, he .. has moved more than 70 million pounds,\" Plaza added.\n \n Related article\nCNN spotlights 10 men and women who are making the world a better place \n Debra Vines - whose nonprofit The Answer Inc. supports families impacted by autism in underserved communities across Chicago - was honored by actress Holly Robinson Peete, a \"fellow autism mom.\" \n Vines says her group has provided programming and guidance to more than 4,000 families. \"Join me and be a servant for the change today,\" Vines said when accepting her award.\n\n\n And Emmy award-winning actor Justin Theroux brought his rescue dog Kuma, on the stage to honor Carie Broecker and her nonprofit, Peace of Mind Dog Rescue.\n\n\n Two teenagers making a difference in their communities were also honored as 2022 Young Wonders:\n\n\n Ruby Chitsey, a 15-year-old from Harrison, Arkansas, started \"Three Wishes for Ruby's Residents,\" which donates personal items to nursing home residents who couldn't otherwise afford them.\n\n\n Sri Nihal Tammana, a 13-year-old from Edison, New Jersey, started \"Recycle My Battery,\" which keeps used batteries out of the ecosystem through a network of collection bins.\n\n\n The show also honored two Georgia poll workers, Shaye Moss and her mother Ruby Freeman, whose lives were upended after false allegations that they had been involved in election fraud spread on social media.\n\n\n CNN has partnered with GoFundMe to enable donations to this year's Top 10 honorees.

It offers an incredible intro APR. The balance transfer fee (5%; $5 min.) is higher than some cards, but if you want an equally long intro APR on purchases, this card is hard to beat.\n \n We recommend comparing options to ensure the card you're selecting is the best fit for you.

It gives you plenty of time to pay off purchases and balance transfers without incurring interest charges. Those who can make do with a shorter intro APR period should look for cards with more benefits, such as cash rewards and a welcome offer.\nThe nice thing about credit cards with a 0% intro APR is that it's easy to compare them. The key factor is how long the intro rate lasts -- on purchases, balance transfers, or both, depending on what you need the card for. For example, if you have a lot of debt and are looking for a way to refinance it, then you'd probably want to go with the card that has the longest 0% intro APR on balance transfers. Wells Fargo has done a great job in this regard. Not only does this card have a lengthy introductory period, it applies to purchases and balance transfers. \n Rates & Fees \n Want to know what other sites and real cardholders think of the Wells Fargo Reflect(r) Card? Here's what we found.\nAverage review site rating: 4.1 / 5 stars\nAfter reading reviews from five other top sites, there's a pretty clear consensus about this Wells Fargo card. We all agree that the 0% intro APR offer is excellent, making it one of the best credit cards for avoiding interest, and that the cellphone protection is a valuable extra.\nEveryone's in agreement about this card's drawbacks, too: Lack of rewards, a high balance transfer fee, and a foreign transaction fee. The only difference of opinion is the overall rating each of us gave this card.\nThe Wells Fargo Reflect(r) Card hasn't exactly set the social media world on fire, but responses have generally been positive. It's widely recognized as an excellent 0% intro APR and balance transfer card.\nSome cardholders have called out the balance transfer fee of 5%, min: $5, since that's more than the 3% charged by several other cards. But they also acknowledge that 21 months from account opening is a long time to pay off credit card debt.\nIf you need to avoid interest charges for as long as possible, look no further. The Wells Fargo Reflect(r) Card has a 0% intro APR on purchases and qualifying balance transfers for 21 months from account opening. That's nearly two years where you won't be paying credit card interest.\nBalance transfers made within the first 120 days qualify for the intro rate. After the intro period ends, the go-to 17.24%, 23.74%, or 28.99% Variable APR applies on your card's balance going forward.\nThis is the longest 0% intro APR I've seen. Since it applies to purchases and balance transfers, there are all kinds of ways to use it. You could:\nConsidering how much smartphones cost, and the many hazards they seem to face, it's a good idea to have yours insured. They may seem affordable when you're paying them off across 24 monthly payments. When you lose one and need to pay MSRP for a new iPhone, that's when you realize it costs about as much as a rent payment.\nIf you have this card and use it to pay your monthly cellphone bill, you won't need to shell out extra for insurance. It has complimentary cellphone protection of up to $600, with a $25 deductible. This covers damage, theft, and involuntary or accidental parting (when you know where your phone is, but it's impractical to recover it).\nThe biggest drawback with this card is that it doesn't offer any sort of rewards program. That means:\nTo be fair, this card has special offers through My Wells Fargo Deals, where you can earn cash back statement credits on shopping, dining, and experiences you pay for with your eligible Wells Fargo card. But earning some statement credits here and there isn't nearly as valuable as earning cash rewards on all your everyday purchases.\nBecause of the lack of rewards, this card doesn't have much long-term value. Once the 0% intro APR ends, there's no incentive to continue using it. You're better off switching to a rewards credit card at that point.\nIt's worth noting that there are 0% APR credit cards that also have rewards programs. They just have shorter 0% APR intro periods. If you don't need the entire 21 months from account opening this Wells Fargo card offers, then it could make more sense to pick a card with a shorter intro period that earns rewards.\nThe Wells Fargo Reflect(r) Card is a great balance transfer card because of its 0% intro APR. But it also has a balance transfer fee of 5%, min: $5.\nBalance transfer cards normally have a fee like this, but some of them only charge 3%. It may not seem like much, but if you're transferring $5,000, that 2% difference would cost you an extra $100. If you don't need 21 months from account opening to get out of debt, you may want to look at more credit card reviews and pick a card with a lower balance transfer fee.\nThere's also a foreign transaction fee of 3%, which is another reason why this isn't the best card for long-term use. If you ever travel outside the United States, it's important to have a card you can use without any extra fees, like a travel credit card\nA FICO(r) Score of 670 or higher, which is considered good credit, is suggested to apply for the Wells Fargo Reflect(r) Card. Keep in mind that credit card applications depend on many factors, including your income and other parts of your financial profile.\nWells Fargo offers an online prequalification tool. All you need to do is provide some basic information, and you'll see any prequalified credit card offers you have with Wells Fargo, which may or may not include the Wells Fargo Reflect(r) Card.\nThe Wells Fargo Reflect(r) Card has a 0% intro APR for 21 months from account opening on purchases and qualifying balance transfers. Balance transfers made within 120 days from account opening qualify for the introductory rate.\nHere are the fees for the Wells Fargo Reflect(r) Card:\nThe minimum credit limit on the Wells Fargo Reflect(r) Card is $1,000. It's possible to get a much larger amount -- some cardholders have reported being approved for limits of over $25,000. When you're approved for this card, Wells Fargo sets a credit limit based on several factors, primarily your income and credit history.\nAt Motley Fool Money, we rate credit cards on a five-star scale (1 = poor, 5 = best). Our rating criteria includes rewards rates, welcome bonuses, fees, and perks like travel credits and 0% intro APR offers to evaluate our ratings.\nWe combine these factors with an evaluation of brand reputation and customer satisfaction to ensure you're getting the best card recommendations. Learn more about how Motley Fool Money rates credit cards.\nIt's not hard to get approved for the Wells Fargo Reflect(r) Card, but it depends on your credit score and your financial profile. A credit score of 670 or higher is recommended when applying to make it more likely that you qualify for the card.\nThe credit limit for the Wells Fargo Reflect(r) Card can range from $1,000 to over $10,000. Wells Fargo sets your credit limit when it approves you for the card based on your creditworthiness, income, and other financial information.\nNo, the Wells Fargo Reflect(r) Card doesn't have an annual fee. \n We're firm believers in the Golden Rule, which is why editorial opinions are ours alone and have not been previously reviewed, approved, or endorsed by included advertisers.

The bodies of the victims were found buried in a mass grave, with evidence suggesting execution at close range.  International organizations like UNRWA and OCHA have condemned the attack, calling for an independent investigation into potential war crimes. The Palestinian group Hamas has also demanded international justice for the victims. \n"

      "content": "The victims were considered disposable - not only by the perpetrators but also by those who were supposed to help them.\n\n\n\"My daughter is being gang raped and sold to countless men.\" These were the words, spoken by a heartbroken mother, that first alerted me to the organised rape and pimping gangs - now commonly referred to as \"grooming gangs\" - targeting young girls in the north of England.\nIt was the late 1990s and, knowing that I was a campaigner against child sexual exploitation, some of the mothers of these girls had reached out to me. They were desperate for help. \n I wasn't the first person they'd approached. They had tried the authorities - the police and child protection services - but instead of help, they'd found only judgement, about their parenting and their daughters. One police officer described a victim as a \"troublesome slag\". The gang that had abused her was later convicted of horrific child rapes.\nI marvelled at the strength of these mothers even as I saw, up close, the pain in their eyes. I couldn't help but get emotional when one told me about how her 13-year-old daughter had come home crying, with blood all over her legs, high on cannabis and alcohol. She had been anally gang raped.\nSocial workers had told some of the families that their daughters were \"choosing\" this \"lifestyle\" and there was nothing they could do about it. To these adults who were tasked with protecting these children, child rape and prostitution was a \"lifestyle choice\".\nI felt horrified and blindly furious. \"We didn't know,\" the mothers kept telling me. \"We did nothing wrong!\"\nThey came from a broad range of backgrounds, mainly working class. Some of them had happy, stable family setups, and others were more chaotic, where their daughters had been taken into local authority care homes. Some of the girls had already been victims of sexual abuse - by boys in their neighbourhood or male family members. Some of them were being bullied at school. Some were autistic. But all of them shared something in common - neither the police nor child protection professionals had stepped in to help them.\nThe most vulnerable were those in care homes. Workers at these homes would turn a blind eye to the men in flash cars waiting outside for them. When the girls would disappear for days on end, the police would barely look for them.\nIt was obvious, once I spoke to the mothers and some of the girls who had managed to escape the gangs, that this was not an unknown phenomenon - health workers, neighbours and teachers were aware of what was happening. It wasn't a secret that girls had begun to replace heroin as the preferred merchandise for criminals looking to make a fast buck.\nI had previously investigated widespread sexual abuse by clergy and online child abuse rings. Now I wanted to investigate what these mothers were telling me. One evening, I was sat outside a care home in Blackpool, in the north of England, hoping to ask a member of staff what they were doing to protect the girls in their care, when I noticed what looked like a brand-new car pulling up around the corner. It was driven by a man in his 40s. There were two younger men sitting on the back seat. One of the younger men got out of the car, went to the door of the care home and rang the doorbell. He spoke briefly to the member of staff who answered. Five minutes later, a girl who couldn't have been older than 14 ran out and clambered into the back of the car. They drove off.\nI was all too familiar with the machinations of child sexual abuse and exploitation, but there were some key differences between the cases I'd investigated previously and the way these gangs operated. These gangs made their victims believe that they were their saviours. Younger men would be used to draw the victims in. Initially, they'd provide friendship, fast food and fun. Because most of the victims were white and most of the perpetrators were of Pakistani descent, the girls would be told that it was best they didn't tell their parents, as they were \"bound to be racist\". Once the girls were sucked in, they would be passed on to other men, who would sell them from flats.\nEarly reports from parents and victims confirmed that some of the older men in the network were taxi drivers. It soon became clear how the girls were targeted: Taxi drivers would pick them up - often from care homes. I saw taxis pull up outside these homes and girls get in as staff watched from the windows.\nThe taxi drivers would get a fee for each girl delivered to the gang members - mainly men in their 20s and 30s - although that fee often involved being permitted to rape the victim free of charge.\nSome of these gangs were highly organised - young runners would be tasked with making initial contact with the victims; landlords would rent out their flats for the girls to be raped in; others were more opportunistic. All of them benefitted from the culture of impunity that continues to surround the sexual abuse of women and girls - a culture where conviction rates are so low as to render rape virtually decriminalised.\nMost media reports approach complex stories like this as being about race or class or sex - never all three at once. But the truth is that these children were abused because they were girls. They were denied any pretence of protection from the authorities because they were poor. They were targeted because of their race and then ignored by authorities that simultaneously feared being accused of racism while adopting racist assumptions about the sorts of white girls who would \"sleep with\" brown men. This is about race and class and sex. And misogyny runs through all three.\nThese girls were either blamed or not believed. In fact, sometimes they would be prosecuted for being drunk and disorderly while the men who supplied the alcohol - the same men who raped them - were not.\nThese girls were not merely \"duped\" as the word \"grooming\" suggests, although they were certainly tricked into believing that they had a boyfriend in one of the younger procurers; they were raped, sold, abused, in some cases tortured.\nNow, almost three decades after I first spoke to those mothers, nothing has changed. There is still an appalling complacency about organised sexual exploitation, which results in few convictions - regardless of the ethnicity of the perpetrators. The police still are not doing enough. We are still choosing to blame the victims.\nThe views expressed in this article are the author's own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera's editorial stance. \n Follow Al Jazeera English:",
      "ml_hf_summary": "Organized sexual exploitation of young girls, known as \"grooming gangs,\" has been occurring in northern England since the late 1990s. These gangs target vulnerable girls from working-class backgrounds, often exploiting them through manipulation and false promises of friendship and protection.  Victims are lured into prostitution or sexual abuse by men who use tactics like befriending the girls, providing alcohol, and offering \"protection\" before selling them to other perpetrators. The police and child protection services have been criticized for their inadequate response, with some even blaming victims' families for their daughters' exploitation. This has resulted in a culture of impunity surrounding sexual abuse, leading to low conviction rates despite evidence of widespread abuse.  The article highlights the systemic failures in addressing this issue, emphasizing the need for greater accountability and support for victims. \n"

The plant had been stalled for years but was reinvigorated with New Delhi's backing as a joint project.\nIndia and Sri Lanka also concluded their debt restructuring process, Misri said.\nSri Lanka owes about $1.36bn in loans to EXIM Bank of India and State Bank of India, according to Sri Lanka's Finance Ministry data.\nIndia and Sri Lanka also signed pacts on power grid connectivity, digitalisation, security and healthcare.\nModi's visit came as Colombo grapples with the competing interests of New Delhi and Beijing.\nIndia has been concerned about China's growing sway in Sri Lanka, which it considers to be within its sphere of geopolitical influence.\nDissanayake's first foreign visit as president was to New Delhi in December, but he followed that with a visit to Beijing in January, underscoring Sri Lanka's delicate balancing act.\nChina has emerged as Sri Lanka's largest single bilateral creditor, accounting for more than half of its $14bn bilateral debt at the time the island defaulted on its sovereign debt in 2022.\nBeijing was the first to restructure its loans to Sri Lanka, a move that cleared the way for the island to emerge from that year's worst-ever economic meltdown.\nColombo also signed an agreement in January with a Chinese state-owned company that will invest $3.7bn in an oil refinery in the island's south. It would be Sri Lanka's largest single foreign investment and is seen as crucial for the island's economy.\nModi arrived in Sri Lanka late on Friday from a summit in Thailand and a string of meetings with leaders of regional nations as he sought to shore up India's relations with neighbours.\nOn the sidelines of the Bangkok BIMSTEC meeting - the grouping of the seven nations on the Bay of Bengal - Modi held a rare face-to-face meeting with Myanmar's military government chief Min Aung Hlaing.\nModi also held talks with Muhammad Yunus, the interim leader of neighbouring Bangladesh - the first such meeting since a revolution in Dhaka removed New Delhi's long-term ally Sheikh Hasina.\nIndia was the biggest benefactor of Hasina's government and her overthrow sent cross-border relations into a tailspin, culminating in Yunus choosing to make his first state visit last month to China.\nModi also met on Friday in Bangkok with his Nepali counterpart KP Sharma Oli, the first since Kathmandu's leader returned to power last year, as well as Tshering Tobgay of Bhutan. \n Follow Al Jazeera English:",

These cargoes need to arrive by 12:01 am ET (4:01am GMT) on May 27 to avoid the 10 percent duty. \n Moreover, on April 9, Trump's higher \"reciprocal\" tariff rates of 11 percent to 50 percent are due to take effect. European Union imports will be hit with a 20 percent tariff, while Chinese goods will be hit with a 34 percent tariff, bringing Trump's total new levies on China to 54 percent.\nVietnam, which benefitted from the shift of US supply chains away from China after Trump's first-term trade war with Beijing, will be hit with a 46 percent tariff. The country, however, agreed on Friday to discuss a deal with Trump.\nCanada and Mexico are both exempt from Trump's latest duties because they are still subject to a 25 percent tariff related to the US fentanyl crisis for goods that do not comply with the US-Mexico-Canada rules of origin.\nMichael Strain, director of Economic Policy Studies at the American Enterprise Institute, told Al Jazeera that the US tariffs have been greeted quite poorly by the investors.\n\"This would have a really bad effect on the economic outcome of workers and households and businesses,\" he said, adding that the move \"would constitute a tax increase of 400-500 billion dollars this year on American households and on businesses\".\n\"The combination of big increase in taxes and the tariffs would increase the prices of these imported goods that households face [and] would mean that households would very likely see negative income growth... That alone would risk a recession in the US,\" he said.\nOn Friday, China announced that it will impose its own 34 percent tariff on US products from April 10. Beijing also said it would sue the US at the World Trade Organization (WTO) and restrict exports of rare earth elements used in high-end medical and electronics technology.\nTrump warned on Friday on social media that \"China played it wrong,\" saying this was something \"they cannot afford to do\".\nOther major trading partners have held back as they continue to digest the unfolding international standoff and fears of a recession. \n Trump's Wednesday tariff announcement shook global stock markets to their core, wiping out $5 trillion in stock market value for S&P 500 companies by Friday's close, a record two-day decline. Prices for oil and commodities plunged, while investors fled to the safety of government bonds.\nEconomists have also warned that the tariffs could dampen growth and fuel inflation.\nKelly Ann Shaw, a trade lawyer at Hogan Lovells and former White House trade adviser during Trump's first term told a Brookings Institution event on Thursday that she expected the tariffs to evolve over time as countries seek to negotiate lower rates.\n\"This is the single biggest trade action of our lifetime,\" she said. \"But this is huge. This is a pretty seismic and significant shift in the way that we trade with every country on earth.\"\nTrump said on his Truth Social platform that his \"policies will never change\".\nHowever, his latest tariffs have notable exclusions. They do not stack on recently imposed 25 percent tariffs hitting imports of steel, aluminium and automobiles.\nAlso temporarily spared are copper, pharmaceuticals, semiconductors and lumber, alongside \"certain critical minerals\" and energy products, the White House said.\nBut Trump has ordered investigations into copper and lumber, which could lead to further duties soon.\nHe has threatened to hit other industries like pharmaceuticals and semiconductors as well, meaning any reprieve might be limited. \n Follow Al Jazeera English:",

Fifty-thousand people have died and Microsoft powers this genocide in our region.\"\n\"Thank you for your protest, I hear you,\" Suleyman said.\nAboussad continued, shouting that Suleyman and \"all of Microsoft\" had blood on their hands. She also threw onto the stage a keffiyeh scarf, which has become a symbol of support for Palestinian people, before being escorted out of the event.\nAn investigation by The Associated Press news agency revealed earlier this year that AI models from Microsoft and OpenAI were used as part of an Israeli military programme to select bombing targets during its wars in Gaza and Lebanon.\nA second protester, Microsoft employee Vaniya Agrawal, interrupted another part of the celebration during which Gates, Ballmer and current CEO Satya Nadella were on stage - the first public gathering since 2014 of the three men who have been Microsoft's CEO.\nIn February, five Microsoft employees were ejected from a meeting with Nadella for protesting against the contracts. \n While the February event was an internal meeting, Friday's protest was far more public - a livestreamed showcase of the company's past and future. Some employees also rallied outside the event on Friday.\n\"We provide many avenues for all voices to be heard,\" said a statement from the company.\n\"Importantly, we ask that this be done in a way that does not cause a business disruption. If that happens, we ask participants to relocate. We are committed to ensuring our business practices uphold the highest standards.\"\nVarious other firms and educational institutions have also faced protests over their ties with Israel as the humanitarian crisis in Gaza from Israel's military assault has mounted.\nGaza's Health Ministry says at least 50,609 Palestinians are confirmed dead and 115,063 wounded in Israel's war on Gaza. The enclave's Government Media Office updated its death toll to more than 61,700, saying thousands of people missing under the rubble are presumed dead.\nThe latest bloodshed in the decades-old Israeli-Palestinian conflict began in October 2023 after Palestinian group Hamas attacked Israel, killing at least 1,139 people, according to Israeli officials, and taking more than 200 people captive. \n Follow Al Jazeera English:",

      "content": "The law firm Perkins Coie is fighting an executive order from Donald Trump limiting its access to federal buildings.\nMore than 500 law firms in the United States have rallied in support of Perkins Coie LLP, one of several legal offices that have been targeted under the administration of President Donald Trump.\nIn an amicus brief filed on Friday, the law firms accused the Trump administration of pursuing a campaign of \"draconian punishment\" against legal professionals who represent people and causes the president frowns upon.\n\"Any controversial representation challenging actions of the current administration (or even causes it disfavors) now brings with it the risk of devastating retaliation,\" the brief states.\n\"Whatever short-term advantage an administration may gain from exercising power in this way, the rule of law cannot long endure in the climate of fear that such actions create.\"\nPerkins Coie is one of at least four major law firms that Trump has targeted with executive orders. They include WilmerHale, Paul Weiss and Jenner & Block.\nThe executive orders included broad accusations, including that the law firms participated in the \"destruction of bedrock American principles\" and \"conduct detrimental to critical American interests\".\nAs punishment, the executive orders seek to revoke the security clearances needed for high-stakes cases involving sensitive information, as well as block the law firms' personnel from entering federal buildings like courthouses.\nEach of the law firms targeted represented a cause or person Trump has spoken against.\nIn the case of Perkins Coie, the president cited the law firm's work on behalf of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, a Democrat who ran against Trump in the 2016 presidential race.\nWilmerHale, meanwhile, was singled out for hiring Robert Mueller, a lawyer who formerly served as the head of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). During Trump's first term, Mueller was brought on as a special counsel at the Justice Department to investigate alleged Russian interference in the 2016 election - a probe that Trump opposed.\nFriday's amicus brief argues that Trump seeks to \"cow\" these law firms - and smaller firms by extension - \"into submission\".\nIt pointed out that yanking security clearances and denying access to federal buildings \"would threaten the survival of any law firm\", not to mention scare away clients.\nAlready, multiple law offices have negotiated a deal with the Trump administration - either to lift such sanctions or to avoid them being imposed in the first place.\nOn March 20, six days after the executive order against it, the New York-based law firm Paul Weiss was the first to capitulate.\nOn social media, the president announced that the firm had agreed to offer \"$40 million in pro bono legal services over the course of President Trump's term to support the Administration's initiatives\", in exchange for lifting the executive order.\nOther firms have followed suit. Skadden, Milbank and Willkie Farr & Gallagher - three major law offices - each offered to do $100m in \"pro bono legal services\" for Trump's preferred causes. Some associates at those firms have since resigned from their positions in protest.\nBut Perkins Coie is among the law offices fighting Trump's executive orders, calling them unconstitutional violations of free speech and the right to due process before the law.\nWilmerHale and Jenner & Block have also launched their own legal challenges.\nIn the amicus brief for Perkins Coie, the 500-plus law firms echoed the arguments underpinning those challenges. They slammed the Trump administration's executive order as a threat to the right of every individual to seek protection in the law.\n\"Those Orders pose a grave threat to our system of constitutional governance and to the rule of law itself,\" the brief said. \"The judiciary should act with resolve - now - to ensure that this abuse of executive power ceases.\"\nIt pointed out that law firms like Perkins Coie employ lawyers and experts from across the political spectrum.\nNotably, the brief comes two days after the libertarian Cato Institute filed its own amicus brief in the case, alongside the American Civil Liberties Union.\nFriday's petition even cited the fact that a \"founding father\" of the US, John Adams, represented on cases that were unpopular - defending, for example, British colonists who fired upon US civilians.\nIt explained that Adams did so because he believed in the right to equal justice under the law.\n\"Until now, it would have been inconceivable that a law firm would risk punitive retribution from the federal government for undertaking representations of this kind,\" the brief explained.\nIt called upon the federal court system to place a permanent injunction on Trump's executive orders.\n\"Unless the judiciary acts decisively now, what was once beyond the pale will in short order become a stark reality.\" \n Follow Al Jazeera English:",
      "ml_hf_summary": "Law firm Perkins Coie is challenging an executive order by President Trump limiting its access to federal buildings and revoking security clearances.

The executive orders target several major law firms, including WilmerHale, Paul Weiss, and Jenner & Block, which represent individuals or causes Trump has criticized.  These firms have been pressured to negotiate with the administration, offering pro bono legal services in exchange for lifting the sanctions. Perkins Coie is one of the few firms actively fighting these orders, arguing they violate free speech and due process rights. The amicus brief cites historical precedents where lawyers defended unpopular clients, emphasizing the importance of a judiciary that upholds the rule of law. \n"

Audiologist Dr. Tom Tedeschi shares why it's such a big issue and how vets should properly care for their ears.\nThe old adage is that moms have eyes in the back of their heads, but a new study shows that women in general may also have more sensitive hearing.\nThe study, recently published in the journal Scientific Reports, sought to examine the correlation between multiple factors -- including gender, age and region, among others -- and hearing sensitivity.\nPatricia Balaresque, Ph.D., at the Centre for Biodiversity and Environmental Research in Toulouse, France, led a team of scientists to conduct hearing tests on 448 individuals from 13 global communities in Ecuador, England, Gabon, South Africa and Uzbekistan.\nCRUNCHES BY AGE: HERE'S HOW MANY YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO DO\nThe results show that hearing sensitivity is primarily influenced by gender and environment, followed by age and left versus right ear.\n\"Our findings challenge existing assumptions and highlight the need to consider both biological and environmental factors when studying hearing,\" Balaresque said in a press release.\nA new study, recently published in the journal Scientific Reports, shows that women may have more sensitive hearing. (iStock)\nScientists measured hearing sensitivity using transient-evoked otoacoustic emissions (TEOAE), which assess the cochlea's ability to produce and transmit an acoustic response after sound stimulation.\nARE FULL-BODY SCANS WORTH THE MONEY? DOCTORS SHARE WHAT YOU SHOULD KNOW\nThe cochlea is a fluid-filled, spiral-shaped cavity in the inner ear that converts sound waves into electrical impulses that the brain can interpret, medical sources state.\nBy analyzing TEOAE profiles, researchers gained valuable insights into how the cochlea responds to external auditory stimuli.\nScientists measured hearing sensitivity by recording the tiny sounds subjects' inner ears sent back in response to clicking sounds. (iStock)\nTo calculate hearing sensitivity, a small device played a clicking sound into the ear of test subjects and then recorded the tiny sounds the inner ear sent back in response, the study findings detailed.\nThese returning signals, which are created by cells in the cochlea, provide a reliable indication of how sensitive the ear is to sound.\nMEN FACE HIGHER CANCER RISK WITH THIS SPECIFIC BODY FAT MEASUREMENT\nThe researchers then examined the signals, including how strong they were (measured in decibels, a unit used to convey the relative intensity or loudness of a sound) and which frequencies the ear responded to most strongly.\nThey also compared variations based on a variety of factors, including subjects' sex, age, ear being tested, and the type of environment they lived in.\nThe fact that women showed higher sensitivity means that hearing may be an actual biological factor, according to researchers. (iStock)\nThroughout the testing, women consistently showed a higher sensitivity, by an average of two decibels across all populations sampled.\n\"We were surprised to find that women had two decibels more sensitive hearing across all the populations we measured, and this accounted for most of the variations between individuals,\" said study co-author Turi King, professor and director of the Milner Centre for Evolution at the University of Bath, in the release.\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER\n\"This could be due to different exposure to hormones during development in the womb, due to men and women having slight structural differences in cochlear anatomy.\"\nWomen also perform better in other hearing tests and speech perception, which indicates that their brains are better at processing information, according to King.\n\"Having more sensitive hearing in noisy environments may not always be a good thing.\"\n\"We don't really know why this might be, but given the detrimental effect of noise on overall health, such as sleep quality and increased cardiovascular disease, having more sensitive hearing in noisy environments may not always be a good thing,\" she added.\nWhile differences in age were also a factor in hearing sensitivity (with old age linked to worse hearing), it was less pronounced than the differences between sexes.\nPeople in urban environments had hearing profiles that shifted to higher frequencies, perhaps due to the constant lower sounds of the city, the study suggests. (iStock)\nOther findings in the study included the way ecological environments can impact hearing sensitivity.\nFor those in urban environments, hearing profiles shifted to higher frequencies, which could be due to the constant low hum of traffic and city noises in urban environments, scientists hypothesized.\nFor more Health articles, visit www.foxnews.com/health\nThe greatest contrast was found between groups living in high-altitude populations versus tropical environments, with the latter having a higher sensitivity to hearing. \nThis could be a result of living in areas with fewer humans in the environment, or an inherited trait from the sort of wild environment where vigilance is essential for survival, the researchers noted.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nProfessor King added, \"We know that humans are continuing to evolve, so the next question is whether our hearing is able to change in response to different environments generally or whether there are genetic adaptations involved.\"\nKhloe Quill is a lifestyle production assistant with Fox News Digital.

We are now one step closer to achieving those goals,\" Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., and his top lieutenants wrote to House Republicans.\n\"Today, the Senate passed its version of the budget resolution. Next week, the House will consider the Senate amendment.\"\nCongressional Republicans are pushing a conservative policy overhaul via the budget reconciliation process. Traditionally used when one party holds all three branches of government, reconciliation lowers the Senate's threshold for passage on certain fiscal measures from 60 votes to 51.\nTED CRUZ CLASHES WITH KEY DEMOCRAT OVER 'SECOND PHASE OF LAWFARE' THROUGH FEDERAL JUDGES' ORDERS\nPresident Donald Trump helped get House Republicans' budget bill over the line in February, and backed the Senate version this week (Getty Images)\nAs a result, it's been used to pass sweeping policy changes in one or two massive pieces of legislation.\nSenate Republicans passed a framework for a reconciliation bill just after 2 a.m. ET on Saturday, after hours of debate and votes on amendments to the measure.\nIt's similar to the version House Republicans passed in late February; but mechanisms the Senate used to avoid factoring in the cost of extending Trump's 2017-era tax cuts as well as a lower baseline for required federal spending cuts has some House conservatives warning they could oppose the bill.\nThe Senate's version calls for at least $4 billion in spending cuts, while the House's version mandates a floor of $1.5 trillion to $2 trillion.\nBoth bills also include Trump priorities on border security, energy, and new tax policies like eliminating penalties on tipped and overtime wages.\n\"If the Senate's 'Jekyll and Hyde' budget is put on the House floor, I will vote no,\" Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, wrote on X.\n\"In the classic ways of Washington, the Senate's budget presents a fantastic top-line message - that we should return spending back to the pre-COVID trajectory (modified for higher interest, Medicare, and Social Security) of $6.5 Trillion, rather than the current trajectory of over $7 Trillion - but has ZERO enforcement to achieve it, and plenty of signals it is designed purposefully NOT to achieve it.\"\nSenate Majority Leader John Thune, a Republican from South Dakota, speaks during a news conference (Al Drago/Bloomberg via Getty Images)\nBut House GOP leaders insist that the Senate's passage of its framework simply allows the House to begin working on its version of the bill passed in February - and that it does not impede their process in any way.\n\"The Senate amendment as passed makes NO CHANGES to the House reconciliation instructions that we voted for just weeks ago. Although the Senate chose to take a different approach on its instructions, the amended resolution in NO WAY prevents us from achieving our goals in the final reconciliation bill,\" the letter said.\n\"We have and will continue to make it clear in all discussions with the Senate and the White House that--in order to secure House passage--the final reconciliation bill must include historic spending reductions while protecting essential programs.\"\nGOP DEFECTORS HELP SENATE ADVANCE RESOLUTION TO CANCEL TRUMP TARIFFS DESPITE WHITE HOUSE VETO WARNING\nHouse GOP leaders have pointed out that passing a framework is just the first step in a long process, one that just lays out broad instructions for how money should be spent.\nNow that similar frameworks have passed the House and Senate, the relevant congressional committees will work out how to achieve the final reconciliation policy goals under their given jurisdictions.\n\"We have made it clear the House will NOT accept nor participate in an 'us versus them' process resulting in a take it or leave it proposition from the Senate,\" House leaders warned.\n\"Immediately following House adoption of the budget resolution, our House and Senate committees will begin preparing together their respective titles of the reconciliation bill to be marked up in the next work period.\"\nThe letter reiterated Johnson's earlier goal of having a bill on Trump's desk by the end of May.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nHouse Budget Committee Chairman Jodey Arrington, R-Texas, called the Senate's resolution \"unserious and disappointing,\" noting it only mandated $4 billion in \"enforceable cuts.\"\nHe vowed to work with congressional leaders to find the best path forward, however.\n\"I am committed to working with President Trump, House leadership, and my Senate counterparts to address these concerns and ensure the final reconciliation bill makes America safe, prosperous, and fiscally responsible again,\" Arrington said.\nElizabeth Elkind is a politics reporter for Fox News Digital leading coverage of the House of Representatives.

      "content": "Watch CBS News \n Updated on: April 5, 2025 / 4:35 PM EDT\n / CBS/AP \n President Trump will meet with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House on Monday, several people familiar with the meeting confirmed to CBS News on Saturday.\nThe leaders are expected to focus on the latest Israeli military operations in Gaza and new U.S. tariffs announced by Mr. Trump against Israel and other countries. \nNetanyahu's office later confirmed in a statement that he had received an invitation from Mr. Trump and will fly to the U.S. Sunday, saying the two leaders will also discuss \"Israeli-Turkish relations, the Iranian threat, and the fight at the International Criminal Court.\"\n\"The Prime Minister appreciates the personal and warm relationship with President Trump, and thanks him for inviting him to be the first leader to meet with him after the imposition of global tariffs, just as he was the first leader to meet with him after entering the White House,\" the statement read.\nThis would be their second meeting of Mr. Trump's second term. The two last met in Washington, D.C. in February, when Mr. Trump unveiled his plan for the U.S. to \"take over Gaza\" and turn it into \"the Riviera of the Middle East.\"\nThe meeting by the two leaders comes amid a stepped-up offensive in Gaza that the Israeli military said is aimed at putting pressure on Hamas to release the remaining hostages and, eventually, expel the militant group.\nMeanwhile, Israel says it has deployed troops to a newly established security corridor across Southern Gaza. Netanyahu announced the new Morag Corridor on Saturday and suggested it would cut off the southern city of Rafah, which Israel has ordered evacuated, from the rest of Gaza. \nA military statement Saturday said troops with the 36th Division had been deployed in the corridor. It was not immediately clear how many had deployed or where exactly the corridor was located. Morag is the name of a Jewish settlement that once stood between Rafah and Khan Younis, and Netanyahu suggested it would run between the cities.\nMaps published by Israeli media showed the new corridor running the width of the narrow coastal strip from east to west.\nNetanyahu said it would be \"a second Philadelphi corridor,\" referring to the Gaza side of the border with Egypt further south, which has been under Israeli control since last May.\nIsrael has also reasserted control over the Netzarim corridor that cuts off the northern third of Gaza, including Gaza City, from the rest of the strip. The Philadelphi and Netzarim corridors run from the Israeli border to the Mediterranean Sea.\nHamas, which had long been designated a terrorist organization by Israel and the U.S. even before it carried out the brutal Oct. 7, 2023 attack on Israel that sparked the war in Gaza, said Friday that Israel's ongoing offensive in Gaza was creating a \"highly dangerous\" situation for the hostages still held there. It warned that half of the living captives were in areas where the Israeli army had ordered evacuations.\n\"Half of the living Israeli (hostages) are located in areas that the Israeli occupation army has requested to be evacuated in recent days,\" Abu Obeida, spokesman for Hamas's armed wing, said in a statement, AFP reported. \"We have decided not to transfer these (hostages)... but (this situation) is highly dangerous to their lives.\"\nHamas says it will only release the remaining 59 hostages -- 24 of whom are believed to be alive -- in exchange for the release of more Palestinian prisoners, a lasting ceasefire and an Israeli pullout from Gaza. The group has rejected demands that it lay down its arms or leave the territory.\nIsrael has issued sweeping evacuation orders for parts of northern Gaza ahead of expected expansions in its ground operations. The U.N. humanitarian office said around 280,000 Palestinians have been displaced since Israel abruptly ended a ceasefire with Hamas last month that had been brokered by the U.S., Egypt and Qatar.\nTo pressure Hamas, Israel has imposed a monthlong blockade on food, fuel and humanitarian aid that has left civilians facing acute shortages as supplies dwindle -- a tactic that rights groups say is a war crime. Israel said earlier this week that enough food had entered Gaza during a six-week truce to sustain the territory's roughly 2 million Palestinians for a long time.\nThe war began when Hamas-led militants attacked southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking 251 hostages, most of whom have since been released in ceasefire agreements and other deals. Israel rescued eight living hostages and has recovered dozens of bodies.\nMore than 50,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza as part of Israel's offensive, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which doesn't say whether those killed are civilians or combatants. The ministry says more than half of those killed were women and children. Israel says it has killed around 20,000 militants, without providing evidence. \n Jennifer Jacobs \n contributed to this report.\n \n (c) 2025 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

      "content": "Watch CBS News \n Updated on: April 5, 2025 / 12:16 PM EDT\n / CBS/AP \n Deir al Balah, Gaza Strip -- Israeli airstrikes killed at least 100 Palestinians across the Gaza Strip on Thursday, including 31 or more who were sheltering at a school, according to medics in the Hamas-ruled enclave, in a stepped-up offensive that Israel's military says is intended to pressure Hamas to free hostages and eventually expel the militant group. The bodies of 14 children and five women were recovered from the school in the Tuffah neighborhood of Gaza City, and the death toll could rise because some of the 70 wounded sustained critical injuries, said Health Ministry spokesman Zaher al-Wahidi. \nThe Civil Defense rescue agency in Gaza said Friday that at least 31 people were killed in the strike on the school, with around 100 others injured. More than 30 other Gaza residents were killed in strikes on homes in the nearby neighborhood of Shijaiyah, al-Wahidi said, citing records at Ahli Hospital.\n The Israeli military said it struck a \"Hamas command and control center\" in the Gaza City area, and that it took steps to lessen harm to civilians. Israel gave the same reason -- striking Hamas militants in a \"command and control center\" -- for attacking a United Nations building used as a shelter a day earlier, killing at least 17 people.\n Hamas, which had long been designated a terrorist organization by Israel and the U.S. even before it carried out the brutal Oct. 7, 2023 attack on Israel that sparked the war in Gaza, called the strike on the school a \"heinous massacre\" of innocent civilians.\nIsrael has long accused Hamas of hiding weapons and fighters in and around civilian infrastructure, but the Israel Defense Forces provided no immediate evidence to back up its claim that Hamas commanders were present in the Gaza school or the U.N. building it bombed this week.\nThe strikes came as Israel's military ordered more residents in parts of northern Gaza to evacuate west and south to shelters, warning that it planned to \"work with extreme force in your area.\" A number of the Palestinians fleeing the targeted areas did so on foot, with some carrying their belongings on their backs and others using donkey carts.\n \"My wife and I have been walking for three hours covering only one kilometer,\" said Mohammad Ermana, 72. The couple, clasping hands, each walked with a cane. \"I'm searching for shelters every hour now, not every day,\" he said.\n Israel has issued sweeping evacuation orders for parts of northern Gaza ahead of expected expansions in its ground operations. The U.N. humanitarian office said around 280,000 Palestinians have been displaced since Israel abruptly ended a ceasefire with Hamas last month that had been brokered by the U.S., Egypt and Qatar.\n The fresh evacuation orders came a day after senior government officials said Israel would seize large parts of the Palestinian territory and establish a new security corridor across it. Israel has imposed a monthlong blockade on food, fuel and humanitarian aid on Gaza that has left civilians facing acute shortages as supplies dwindle -- a tactic that rights groups say is a war crime. Israel says it is intended to pressure Hamas to release hostages and disarm.\n Hamas has said it will only release the remaining 59 hostages -- 24 of whom are believed to be alive -- in exchange for the release of more Palestinian prisoners, a lasting ceasefire and an Israeli withdrawal from Gaza. The group has rejected demands that it lay down its arms or leave the territory.\n Overnight strikes by Israel killed at least 55 people in the Gaza Strip, hospital officials said Thursday.\nIn the southern city of Khan Younis, officials said the bodies of 14 people had been taken to Nasser Hospital - nine of them from the same family. The dead included five children and four women. The bodies of another 19 people, including five children aged between 1 and 7 years and a pregnant woman, were taken to the European hospital near Khan Younis, hospital officials said. In Gaza City, 21 bodies were taken to Ahli hospital, including those of seven children.\n Later in the day, strikes killed four more people in Khan Younis, according to Nasser Hospital, and another two people were killed in central Gaza and taken to Al Aqsa Hospital.\n The attacks came as the Israeli military promised an independent investigation of a March 23 operation in which its forces opened fire on ambulances in southern Gaza. U.N. officials say 15 Palestinian medics and emergency responders were killed, and their bodies and ambulances were buried by Israeli soldiers in a mass grave.\n The military initially said the ambulances were operating suspiciously and that nine militants were killed. The military said the probe would be led by an expert fact-finding body \"responsible for examining exceptional incidents\" during the war. Rights groups say such Israeli investigations are often lacking and that soldiers are rarely punished.\n The head of the Palestine Red Crescent Society, Younes Al-Khatib, said Thursday he believed some of the medics were still alive when they were overtaken by Israeli forces. The organization's radio dispatchers heard a conversation in Hebrew between medics and Israeli soldiers after the ambulances had come under fire, Al-Khatib told members of the U.N. Security Council.\n Riyad Mansour, the Palestinian U.N. ambassador, told the U.N. Security Council he was turning over a video he obtained, allegedly showing the moments leading up to the Israeli killing of 15 humanitarian workers in Gaza.\n Mansour said the video shows that the aid workers, including eight members of the Palestinian Red Crescent Society, were traveling in emergency vehicles with the lights on at night to deconflict with Israeli Defense Forces. But, Mansour said, the video \"found on the body of one of the martyrs,\" shows that the Israeli army ambushed the vehicle despite the emergency lights.\n Israel's war in Gaza has killed more than 50,600 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Hamas-run Health Ministry, which doesn't say whether those killed are civilians or combatants but says more than half of those killed were women and children. In an update on Friday, the ministry said 1,249 people had been killed in Gaza since March 18, when Israel resumed strikes, ending a ceasefire in the Palestinian territory.\nIsrael says it has killed around 20,000 militants, without providing evidence.\n The war has left most of Gaza in ruins and at its height displaced around 90% of the population.\n The war began when Israel retaliated immediately for the Hamas-led terrorist attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, which killed around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and saw 251 others taken as hostages back into Gaza, most of whom have since been released in ceasefire agreements and other deals.

      "content": "Watch CBS News \n Updated on: April 5, 2025 / 11:16 AM EDT\n / CBS/AP \n Europe vowed retaliation. China plotted tariffs of its own. Mexico scrambled to blunt the blow. But while the world's leaders were wringing their hands over President Donald Trump's announcement of sweeping tariffs on U.S. imports, Argentina's right-wing president was ebullient, feted at Mr. Trump's Mar-a-Lago club.\nAs part of his enthusiastic outreach to Mr. Trump, Argentine President Javier Milei flew from one of the planet's southernmost nations all the way to Palm Beach for 24 hours to receive an award honoring his libertarian agenda and, he'd hoped, to chat with Mr. Trump, who was also scheduled to attend the right-wing \"American Patriot\" gala.\n\"Make Argentina Great Again!\" Milei bellowed from the ballroom stage at at Mar-a-Lago late Thursday.\nIt would have been the fourth face-to-face meeting between the leaders since Mr. Trump's election victory last November as President Milei, who has imposed a sweeping austerity program to fix Argentina's long troubled economy, offers himself as one of Mr. Trump's strongest allies in the global culture war against the \"woke\" left. \nWhether Milei's staunch alliance with Mr. Trump can actually help crisis-stricken Argentina remains to be seen, analysts say.\n\"He has a special relationship with Trump that has been good for him politically, but he needs to translate that into being good for the country economically,\" said Marcelo J. Garcia, director for the Americas at New York-based geopolitical risk consultancy Horizon Engage. \"He hasn't managed to do that yet.\" \nEarlier this year, Milei pulled Argentina out of the World Health Organization after the U.S. announced its own exit. \nHe threatened to quit the Paris climate accord after Mr. Trump did. He outlawed gender change treatments for minors after Mr. Trump banned transgender athletes from participating in women's sports. He even promoted a cryptocurrency token echoing the $Trump memecoin -- at great political cost. In Milei's case, the cryptocoin Libra collapsed and left investors holding the bag, to the tune of $250 million. He later admitted that he posted about the coin without properly vetting the details. \nMilei has also slashed government spending, similarly to what Mr. Trump and Elon Musk have done with the Department of Government Efficiency. He has reduced government spending in Argentina by over 30% since taking office in 2023 by eliminating about a dozen government agencies, laying off 10% of the federal workforce and freezing state wages and pensions. While the cuts have lowered the country's hyperinflation, they have pushed up unemployment and poverty rates. Weekly protests have been held criticizing the cuts. \nThe cuts were something Milei promised while running for office, even wielding a chainsaw during his campaign. He then gifted Musk a giant chainsaw modeled after the power tool. Musk waved the chainsaw during remarks at the Conservative Political Action Conference. \nRailing against socialism and feminism at speaking events all over the world -- including at CPAC -- Milei has fashioned himself into something of a MAGA celebrity.\nWhile U.S. partners and rivals alike were criticizing Mr. Trump's tariffs, a tux-clad Milei was holding forth beside a painting of Mr. Trump's pumped fist, reveling in the opportunity to prove himself a dogged champion of the American president.\n\"As you can see, we conduct policy with actions, not mere words, and on that we agree with President Donald Trump,\" Milei told the crowd at Mar-a-Lago, drawing cheers at the mention of the American president's name as he spoke in Spanish.\nIn Buenos Aires, Milei's government sought to reconcile Mr. Trump's major round of tariffs with its own radical libertarian ideology and fervent support for free trade.\n\"We do not believe this is an attack on free trade, quite the opposite,\" Milei's spokesperson, Manuel Adorni, said of Mr. Trump's announcement. \"I don't see why there should be so much concern about this.\"\nFor all the leaders' mutual flattery, Argentina was slapped with a 10% minimum tariff. But officials framed it as uniquely preferential treatment. The front page of Argentina's largest-circulation daily, Clarin, declared: \"Trump raises the tax on our products less than on other countries.\"\nIn Washington, Argentine Foreign Minister Gerardo Werthein on Thursday held what he described as \"highly productive\" meetings with top U.S. trade negotiator Jamieson Greer and Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick, releasing rosy statements promising that Argentina was on its way to negotiating a free-trade agreement with the U.S.\nMilei praised progress toward the free deal in his Mar-a-Lago speech. But far more important to the Argentine leader is a hoped-for $20 billion bailout with the International Monetary Fund. The badly needed cash would help Milei keep his ambitious economic reforms on track as pressure mounts on the country's sparse foreign currency reserves. \nMilei has already used executive powers to remove the need for Congress to approve a new IMF program. But the loan hasn't cleared the finish line, with negotiators still haggling over how much cash Argentina, a serial defaulter that owes some $44 billion to the fund, will be allowed to access up-front. \nIt was against this backdrop on Wednesday that Milei, accompanied by his economy minister, hopped on the plane to the U.S., the fund's biggest stakeholder. He told journalists he expected \"an informal meeting\" with Mr. Trump, who was instrumental during his first term in helping Argentina secure a major $56 billion loan from the fund in 2018. \nBut on Friday, Milei's much-anticipated photo-op with Mr. Trump was nowhere to be found in his publicist's slick montage of the Argentine president snapping selfies with fans on Mar-a-Lago's red carpet. \nThe president's office said nothing about his meeting -- or, non-meeting -- with Mr. Trump, and did not respond to multiple requests for comment. \nMr. Trump arrived at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach very late Thursday evening after attending an event with professional golfers at one of his golf courses near Miami. The White House didn't say whether he and Milei met.\nMajor Argentine newspapers cited anonymous officials saying the leaders never met, drawing instant scorn from his political enemies.\n\"When I woke up, I thought I'd find on TV the photo-op with your 'friend' Trump that you went looking for,\" left-wing former President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner wrote on social media. \"What a way to mess around and spend money on nothing.\" \n (c) 2025 CBS Interactive Inc.

      "summary": "Wigs and beauty contests are big business in Ivory Coast, but the industry is facing change.",
      "content": "Long, flowing wigs and weave extensions have dominated the catwalks of Ivory Coast's massively popular beauty pageants for years.\nContestants in the West African nation often spend a huge amount of money on their appearance, from outfits to hairdos - with very few choosing the natural look.\nIn more than six decades, there have only been two notable exceptions, the most recent was Marlene-Kany Kouassi, who took the Miss Ivory Coast title in 2022 - looking resplendent with her short natural hair, the crown becoming her only adornment.\nHer victory was not only unusual in Ivory Coast but across the world, where Western beauty standards are often the desired look both for those entering contests and for the judges.\nChanges are slowly creeping in - last December Angelique Angarni-Filopon, from the French Caribbean island of Martinique, made headlines when she was crowned Miss France, mainly because of her age - she is 34 - and she also sported short Afro hair.\nBut this year the organisers of the Ivorian competition are shaking things up right from the start.\nWigs, weaves and hair extensions have been banned from the preliminary stages of the competition, which are held in 13 cities across the country (as well as two abroad for those in the diaspora).\n\"We want the candidates to be natural - whether with braids or straightened hair, it should be their own. Beauty must be raw,\" Victor Yapobi, president of the Miss Ivory Coast organising committee, told the BBC.\nIvory Coast is the only African country enforcing the ban for a national competition. \nMr Yapobi said the organisers in Ivory Coast had long been trying to promote a more natural look - for example cosmetic surgery is a no-no and skin lightening is frowned upon.\n\"We decided this year to truly showcase the natural beauty of these young women,\" he said.\nOther changes have also been implemented, like allowing slightly shorter women to compete - the minimum is now 1.67m (5.4ft), increasing the age by three years to 28 and - crucially - lowering the entrance fee by more than $30 (PS25) to $50.\n\"This change in criteria is because we observed these young women were putting up a lot of money to participate, and it was becoming a bit of a budget drain.\"\nWhen the BBC joined the first preliminary pageant in Daloa, the main city in the western region of Haut-Sassandra, one contestant was overjoyed by the new rules - feeling it gave her a better chance of success as she prefers not to wear wigs.\n\"I would see other girls with long, artificial hair, and they looked so beautiful,\" 21-year-old Emmanuella Dali, a real estate agent, told the BBC.\n\"This rule gives me more pride as a woman - as an African woman.\"\nThe move aimed at celebrating natural African beauty has sparked a lively debate across the country, where wigs and extensions are popular.\nAs a fashion choice, many women love the creativity that wigs and weaves allow them. They also serve as what is called \"protective style\", which means minimising the daily pulling and tugging on hair that can cause breakages.\nThis was reflected by some contestants in Daloa who felt the rule removed an element of personal expression.\n\"I'm a wigs fan. I love wigs,\" said contestant and make-up artist Astrid Menekou. The 24-year-old told the BBC she was initially shocked by the no-wig, no-extensions stipulation.\n\"I didn't expect this rule! But now? I like my hair, and that's OK.\"\nThe new rule has made the competitors think more about concepts of beauty - and changed some opinions, like those of Laetitia Mouroufie.\n\"Last year, I had extensions because I thought that's what beauty meant,\" the 25-year-old student told the BBC.\n\"This year, I feel more confident being myself.\"\nShould the competition influence attitudes beyond the pageant world, it could have huge economic implications.\nWigs from human hair, which can last for years if cared for properly, can range in price from an estimated $200 to $4,000, while synthetic ones cost around $10 to $300.\nIvory Coast's hair industry is worth more than $300m a year, with wigs and weaves making up a significant share of that market.\n\"This rule is not good for us,\" Ange Sea, a 30-year-old hairdresser in Daloa, told the BBC. \n\"Many women love wigs. This will hurt our business and we make more money when working with wigs and weaves.\"\nAt her salon, glue will be used to carefully attach wigs to make them look more natural and women will spend hours having weaves and extensions put in.\nIt shows how deeply engrained wig culture is in West Africa, despite a natural hair movement that has been gaining momentum among black women around the world over the last decade.\nNatural hair products have become much more readily available and natural hair influencers proliferate on social media worldwide with advice on how to manage and style natural hair, which can be time-consuming.\nIt used to be considered unprofessional to wear one's hair naturally and it would have been extraordinary to see black female TV stars on screen or CEOs in the boardroom with natural hair.\nAccording to Florence Edwige Nanga, a hair and scalp specialist in the main Ivorian city of Abidjan, this is often still the case in Ivory Coast.\n\"Turn on the TV [here], and you'll see almost every journalist wearing a wig,\" the trichologist told the BBC.\n\"These beauty enhancements are fashionable, but they can also cause problems - like alopecia or scalp infections,\" she warned.\nWith the preliminary rounds under way, arguments over whether pageants should be setting beauty rules or women should decide such things for themselves continues.\nThe outcome may be that there is more of an acceptance of both in Ivory Coast, allowing women to switch styles up - between natural hair and wigs and weaves.\nMr Yapobi said the feedback he had received over the new rules was \"extraordinary\" and clearly showed it was having an impact.\n\"Everyone congratulates us. Everyone, even from abroad. I receive emails and WhatsApp messages from everywhere congratulating us for wanting to return to our roots.\"\nHe said no decision had been taken about whether the wig ban would apply to the 15 contestants who make it to the final of Miss Ivory Coast 2025.\nThis extravaganza will take place at a hotel in Abidjan at the end of June and will be broadcast on national TV.\n\"If it works, we'll continue and carry on this initiative in the years to come,\" Mr Yapobi said.\nFor Doria Kore, who went on to be named Miss Haut-Sassandra, her crown holds even more significance: \"Winning with natural hair shows the true beauty of African women.\"\nMs Dali said she was walking away with something even more valuable - self-confidence: \"I didn't win, but I feel proud.

      "summary": "Gangetic and Indus river dolphins are found in over two-dozen rivers in India.",
      "content": "India's longest and most holy river, the Ganges, is home to thousands of dolphins. But their survival is under threat.\nBut these aren't like the ones found in oceans. They don't leap out of the water in spectacular arcs; surface for long intervals or swim in an upright position. Instead, they swim sideways, spend much of their time underwater, have long snouts and are almost completely blind.\nThese are Gangetic dolphins, a species of river dolphin - and India's national aquatic animal - that's found largely in the Ganges-Brahmaputra river system in the northern part of the country.\nA new survey finds India's rivers host around 6,327 river dolphins - 6,324 Gangetic and just three Indus dolphins. A majority of the Indus dolphins are found in Pakistan as the river flows through both the South Asian countries.\nBoth these dolphin species are classified as \"endangered\" by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). \nResearchers from the Wildlife Institute of India surveyed 58 rivers across 10 states between 2021 and 2023 to produce the first comprehensive count of India's river dolphins. \nThe origins of river dolphins are as fascinating as the creatures themselves. Often called \"living fossils\", they evolved from marine ancestors millions of years ago, say scientists. \nWhen the sea once flooded low-lying areas of South Asia, these dolphins moved inland - and when the waters receded, they stayed. Over time, they adapted to murky, shallow rivers, developing traits that set them apart from their ocean-dwelling cousins.\nExperts say the new survey is crucial for tracking river dolphin populations. Since 1980, at least 500 dolphins have died - many accidentally caught in fishing nets or killed deliberately - highlighting the ongoing threat to the species.\nConservationist Ravindra Kumar Sinha says that up until the early 2000s, there was very little awareness about river dolphins.\nIn 2009, the Gangetic river dolphin was declared India's national aquatic animal to boost conservation. Steps like a 2020 action plan and a dedicated research centre in 2024 have since helped revive its numbers.\nHowever, conservationists say there's still a long way to go.\nDolphins continue to be poached for their flesh and blubber, from which oil is extracted to use as fishing bait. Other times, they collide with boats or get caught in fishing lines and die.\nNachiket Kelkar of the Wildlife Conservation Trust told Sanctuary Asia magazine that many fishermen often didn't report accidental deaths of dolphins fearing legal trouble. \nUnder Indian wildlife laws, accidental or targeted dolphin killings are treated as \"hunting\" and carry strict penalties. As a result, many poor fishermen quietly dispose of the carcasses to avoid fines. \nRiver cruise tourism, which has picked up in India in the past decade, has further threatened their habitat. Dozens of cruise trips operate on both the Ganges and Brahmaputra rivers.\n\"There's no doubt that disturbances from cruises will gravely impact the dolphins, which are sensitive to noise,\" conservationist Ravindra Kumar Sinha told The Guardian newspaper.\nMr Sinha believes that increased vessel traffic could push Gangetic dolphins towards extinction, much like it did to Baiji dolphins in China's Yangtze river.\nRiver dolphins face threats partly due to their own evolution. Nearly blind, they rely on echolocation - high-pitched sound pulses that bounce off objects and return as echoes - to navigate murky waters. While this trait suits their habitat, it also makes them vulnerable to modern threats.\nTheir poor eyesight and slow swimming speed make river dolphins especially prone to collisions with boats and other obstacles. Adding to their vulnerability is their slow reproductive cycle - they mature between six and 10 years of age and females typically give birth to just one calf every two to three years.\nBut Mr Sinha is hopeful about the future of river dolphins in India. \"Government initiatives have played a big role in saving the dolphins. A lot has been done but a lot more remains to be done too,\" he says.\nSome found the image delightful, but others wondered about OpenAI founder's motives for wooing India.\nOpposition leaders allege the bill dilutes the rights of Muslims, which the government denies.\nManoj Kumar was best known for his patriotic films in the 1960s and 1970s.\nIndia is the world's fastest-growing major economy. How it deals with Trump will define its economic trajectory.\nNorth Sentinel is home to a tribe that does not have contact with the outside world.\nCopyright 2025 BBC. All rights reserved.

It'll be better than great, it'll be a fantastic, unbelievable depression.\"\nThe cold-open sketch kicked off with Trump brushing off recent market turmoil caused by his proposed tariffs, claiming it was \"all part of the plan\" and quipping, \"There's nowhere to go but up - or perhaps further down.\"\nBILL MURRAY SAYS BRUCE WILLIS HAD 'INSANE' JOB BEFORE FAME\n\"This depression's [going to] be so great, we'll be the ones eating the cats and the dogs.

This week's steep losses for the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq were among the worst in the past decade as stocks tumbled for a second day in a row. \nPresident Trump urged Americans to give him time on the policy, writing on the social media platform Truth Social, \"We are bringing back jobs and businesses like never before.

Glenn Ivey, D-Md., discusses the Trump administration acknowledging it mistakenly deported Kilmar Abrego Garcia to El Salvador on 'The Will Cain Show.'\nThe Trump administration has placed a Justice Department (DOJ) lawyer on leave for not \"zealously advocating\" its position in the case involving a Salvadoran man living in Maryland who was mistakenly deported last month. \nAttorney General Pam Bondi's office placed Erez Reuveni, who argued for the government, in Friday's hearing in which a judge ruled Maryland father Kilmar Abrego Garcia must be returned to the U.S. by Monday, on indefinite paid leave, Fox News has learned. \n\"At my direction, every Department of Justice attorney is required to zealously advocate on behalf of the United States,\" Bondi told the New York Times in a statement. \"Any attorney who fails to abide by this direction will face consequences.\" \nFox News Digital has reached out to the DOJ for comment. \nJOHN YOO URGES TRUMP ADMIN TO 'WORK OUT A DEAL' TO RETURN MISTAKENLY DEPORTED INDIVIDUALS\nIn this undated photo provided by the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland, a man identified by Jennifer Vasquez Sura as her husband, Kilmar Abrego Garcia, is led by force by guards through the Terrorism Confinement Center in Tecoluca, El Salvador. (U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland via AP)\nReuveni on Friday admitted that Garcia's deportation was a mistake, according to the New York Times. \nOn Saturday, the Trump administration argued in an emergency appeal that U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis can't force the administration to return Garcia to the U.S. \nXinis on Friday ruled that the government must make arrangements to have Garcia back in the U.S. before Monday at midnight.\nThe Saturday emergency appeal seeks to temporarily stay Xinis' decision until the government has time to properly appeal the ruling. \n\"Late Friday afternoon, a federal district judge ordered the United States to force El Salvador to send one of its citizens - a member of MS-13, no less - back to the United States by midnight on Monday. If there was ever a case for an emergency stay pending appeal, this would be it,\" the government wrote in the emergency appeal reviewed by Fox News Digital. \nThe government also argued that it \"does not have control over\" Garcia now that he is in El Salvador. \n\"Nevertheless, the court's injunction commands that Defendants accomplish, somehow, Abrego Garcia's return to the United States in give or take one business day,\" the appeal said, calling it \"indefensible.\"\nAn undated photo shows Kilmar Abrego Garcia.

Given that status, he has no legal right or basis to be in the United States at all.\" \nVANCE DOUBLES DOWN AFTER TRUMP ADMIN ADMITS 'ERROR' SENDING MAN TO SALVADORAN PRISON\nXinis on Friday said that the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement's March 15th expulsion of Garcia violated the Administrative Procedures Act, since it occurred without a judicial proceeding.\nThe Trump administration has acknowledged Garcia's removal was an \"administrative error,\" but has also defended it, alleging that Garcia has ties to MS-13. \n\"This individual is an illegal criminal who broke our nation's immigration laws. He is a leader in the brutal MS-13 gang, and he is involved in human trafficking,\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a briefing on Tuesday. \nU.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi said all government lawyers are required to \"zealously advocate\" on its behalf. (REUTERS/Nathan Howard)\n\"And now MS-13 is a designated foreign terrorist organization. Foreign terrorists have no legal protections in the United States of America. And this administration is going to continue to deport foreign terrorists and illegal criminals from our nation's interior,\" she added. \nAn immigration judge five years ago said Garcia, who came to the U.S. illegally in 2011 and asked for asylum, could not be deported to his home country, over concerns he would become a victim of local El Salvador gang members.\nHis request for asylum was denied, but he was given protection from deportation and ICE didn't appeal the decision. \nGarcia's wife, Jennifer Vasquez Sura, who is a U.S. citizen, has vigorously campaigned for his return. \nGarcia had been working as a sheet metal apprentice in Maryland and was arrested in an IKEA parking lot on March 12 while his 5-year-old son was in the car. \nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nHis lawyers have argued the man had a Department of Homeland Security permit to work in the country, and strongly deny any gang affiliations.

I watch Instagram. I watch people wipe out on motorcycles. I watch lions and hyenas fight each other.... I don't think you should be asking a comedian.

What is your take on that?\"\n\"If you were reading up, I don't think you read up on it, 'cause I said what I felt about it and I said what a lot of people said,\" Burr responded.\n\"Some people took it that way,\" the reporter said. \"So could you clarify what you think about it?\"\n\"No. No, I'm not going to just have some controversial moment so you can get clicks,\" Burr said. \"I'm not doing that.

I'm not qualified to talk about this.\"\nRegarding Mangione, Burr spoke to Variety magazine in January and expressed some amusement at the suspected murderer putting pressure on healthcare CEOs. \n\"The funny thing when that CEO got whacked was watching CEOs have to be uncomfortable,\" Burr said. \"I'm sure they didn't learn anything, but it's like: This is how you make everybody feel day to day as you apply pressure because 'that's how business is done.'

Two members of the European Parliament were also denied entry in February.\nThe detention of the British MPs comes as Israel faces backlash after a phone video from one of the 15 Palestinian medics killed by Israeli forces last month contradicted Israeli claims that the victims' vehicles did not have emergency signals on when troops opened fire on them in southern Gaza.\nThe footage shows the Red Crescent and the Palestinian Civil Defence teams driving slowly with their emergency vehicles' lights flashing, logos visible, as they pulled up to help an ambulance that had come under fire earlier.\nTheir vehicles immediately come under a barrage of gunfire, which goes on for more than five minutes with brief pauses, the video shows. Eight Red Crescent personnel, six Civil Defence workers and a UN staffer were killed in the shooting before dawn on March 23.\nThe Israeli military earlier said it opened fire on the vehicles because they were \"advancing suspiciously\" on nearby troops without headlights or emergency signals.\nThe International Court of Justice (ICJ) last year found claims that Israel was perpetrating genocide in Gaza were credible and ordered it to refrain from any acts that may amount to such a crime.\nGeoffrey Nice, a top British human rights lawyer and lead prosecutor at Slobodan Milosevic's 2002 trial, has called on the international community to put more pressure on the Israeli government to fully explain its role in the medics' killings in Gaza.\nIn an interview with Al Jazeera, Nice said \"it would be very hard to believe\" that those involved in the massacre of the medical workers were \"rogue elements\" of the Israeli military.\n\"When you have the people, who can send the bulldozers and their diggers, the people who send out the public relations information, which turned out [to] be false, it is very hard to believe that this is a rogue element,\" he said.\n\"If it is not a rogue element, then what's being done is in accordance with the practice and accepted practice within the [Israeli army], and that's going to be something very difficult to confront. Without better justification, or any justification, this is a terribly serious war crime,\" Nice added.\nSince renewed military operations on March 18 ended a short-lived ceasefire with Hamas, Israel has pushed to seize territory in Gaza and killed 1,309 people, according to the enclave's Ministry of Health. \n Follow Al Jazeera English:",

Mutual Fund and ETF data provided by Refinitiv Lipper.\n \n Fox News senior medical analyst Dr. Marc Siegel on who is most at risk for whooping cough and what is contributing to the rise in cases.\nClearing one's throat is a common reflex to remove mucus and irritants -- particularly during allergy season.\nBut for some, it can become a habit that's hard to break, which can lead to stress and anxiety.\nIn an interview with Fox News Digital, laryngologist Dr. Inna Husain shared the causes of chronic throat clearing, as well as when to see a specialist and how to kick the habit.\nWHY DOES RFK JR.'S VOICE SOUND RASPY? HERE'S WHAT TO KNOW\nWhen people clear their throats, it actually slams the vocal folds together, which over time can cause lesions, nodules, bruising and hemorrhages that affect the voice, according to Husain, who works at Powers Health in Munster, Indiana.\n\"Those same vocal cords are used to help create sound -- so if you keep slamming them, you could injure the surface area of the vocal cords,\" she said.\nAn ENT (ear, nose and throat) exam can enable patients to find the root of the problem. (iStock)\nOne cause of throat clearing is laryngeal pharyngeal reflux (LPR), or \"silent reflux.\" This condition occurs when stomach contents come up into the throat, which causes inflammation without the typical heartburn symptoms.\nHAIR LOSS? GUT HEALTH ISSUES? DR. NICOLE SAPHIER REVEALS SMART FIXES\nWhile LPM is not life-threatening, the main concern is its impact on quality of life, according to Husain.\n\"Along with the sensory changes that happen from chronic trauma, [it can] make the throat more sensitive,\" she noted. \"Over time, people clear their throat more because they've reduced the threshold to trigger a throat-clearing.\"\nOver time, people who clear their throat often may find themselves doing it even more because of muscle memory. (iStock)\nAffected parties can then get stuck in a cycle where they clear their throats to remove irritation or mucus, which then creates more irritation and mucus.\n\"It takes less and less irritation and mucus to make you want to throat-clear, so that's another reason we want to try to stop it, because that can affect quality of life as well,\" Husain added.\nBOTOX FOR BURPING? DOCTORS USE INJECTIONS TO TREAT 'NO-BURP SYNDROME'\nOther causes of throat irritation (and subsequent clearing) include allergies, inflammation from conditions like sinusitis, vocal cord issues, aging, asthma, tracheal narrowing and some medications.\n\"As we age, our vocal folds thin. That can cause an inefficient system, which can cause more sensitivity and throat clearing,\" said Husain.\nHusain's patients often come in complaining of other symptoms, or because their family members have noticed an uptick in their throat-clearing, she shared.\nMany people assume allergies are the culprit, but standalone throat clearing is rarely the only symptom, according to the doctor.\nStandalone throat clearing is rarely the only symptom of allergies, a doctor noted. (iStock)\n\"I've actually seen throat-clearing irritation get worse when people start allergy pills or antihistamines without actually having an allergy,\" she cautioned.\nThe first step in solving the issue is determining the root cause. That typically starts with an ear, nose and throat (ENT) exam, where the doctor uses a flexible camera to examine the lining, tissue and vocal cords.\nFor more Health articles, visit www.foxnews.com/health\n\"We try to identify if there's a root cause, if there's something very obvious,\" said Husain. \n\"For example, in people who chronically throat-clear, I've found things like nasal polyps and sinusitis. And then we would go down the regimen of treating that root cause.\"\nAlternative behaviors like sipping water or blowing air instead of clearing the throat can help the throat begin to heal. (iStock)\nIn cases where the root cause is unclear, the doctor also looks at laryngeal hygiene in general, asking, \"Is there a source of inflammation? Can we make the larynx or the voice box happier?\"\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER\nStudies have shown that it helps to hydrate the vocal folds, where most of the irritation originates. Staying hydrated and limiting the source of irritation is one way to begin changing the behavior, Husain advised.\nAdditional tips to lessen irritation and inflammation include avoiding smoking, limiting acidic foods and using saline nebulizers.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nAlternate behaviors to throat-clearing, like swallowing, humming, sipping water or blowing air, can help the components of the throat begin to heal, according to the doctor.\n\"Over time, that helps the larynx reset itself,\" she added.\nKhloe Quill is a lifestyle production assistant with Fox News Digital.

(Antonio Masiello/Getty Images)\n\"My daughter is so smart . . . and she doesn't really have a sense of tragedy yet,\" Knox explained. \"She knows that things aren't fair sometimes, but she encounters the world in terms of fairytales and play. And so, having to communicate with her on her level in some way means being playful - even about the worst experience of my life.\"\n\"She wants to play 'Mama goes to Italy with me,'\" Knox continued. \"She's interpreted that to mean if we go to a park and there's a spot where there are bars, she'll go behind the bars and sort of shake them and go, 'Let me out!' \n\"It's just so silly, and it just really puts it into a new perspective. . . . She knows that mama was very sad for a long time, and mommy's friend was really hurt. . . . It's mind-boggling and also, super-relieving.\"\nFOLLOW THE FOX TRUE CRIME TEAM ON X\nBritish student Meredith Kercher was murdered on Nov. 1, 2007.

(Getty)\n\"I believe in love,\" she continued. \"What do I look for in a man? A sense of humor is extremely important. And I like a guy who's sure of himself.\"\n\"I'm sure of myself, so I want him to be rock steady,\" Bracco added.\nThe \"Goodfellas\" star was previously married twice. Her first marriage was to French hair salon owner Daniel Guerard, whom she met while she was working as a model in Paris. The two tied the knot after she learned that she was pregnant. \n\"Basically, he said, 'Well, what do you want to do?'\" Bracco recalled during a 2006 interview with ABC News.\n\"And I said, 'Well, where I come from, you get married, and you have the child.' And he very happily said, 'OK. Let's do it,'\" she remembered. \nBracco and Guerard married in 1979 and welcomed their daughter Margaux Guerard that year. However, they went on to divorce in 1982. \n\"What do I look for in a man? A sense of humor is extremely important. And I like a guy who's sure of himself. I'm sure of myself, so I want him to be rock steady.\"\nBracco was previously in an 11-year relationship with Harvey Keitel. (Ron Galella, Ltd./Ron Galella Collection via Getty Images)\nFollowing her divorce from Guerard, Bracco began dating Oscar-nominated actor Harvey Keitel. The actress told ABC News that Keitel was \"very intense.\"\n\"I was seduced,\" she recalled.\nBracco and Keitel, who are parents to daughter Stella, 39, were in a relationship for 11 years. The two split in 1993 after Bracco admitted to having an affair with her \"A Talent for the Game\" co-star Edward James Olmos, whom she married the following year. \n\"He hated me for it. I disgusted him,\" Bracco told ABC of confessing to Keitel about the affair. \"That was the beginning of the end. And I knew that. And maybe it was my way, my very immature un-Dr. Melfi-ish way to end that relationship.\"\nAfter their romance ended, Bracco and Keitel engaged in a bitter custody battle over Stella. Bracco was eventually awarded sole custody of their daughter, but the years-long dispute left her owing $2 million in legal fees. It also took a toll on Bracco's marriage to Olmos, and the two called it quits in 2002.\nThe actress was married to Edward James Olmos from 1994 to 2002. ( Jim Smeal/Ron Galella Collection via Getty Images)\nIn the aftermath of the custody battle, Bracco battled depression and decided to seek professional help in 1997 after she was cast in \"The Sopranos.\"\n\"I lost a year of my life to depression, and my advice to anyone going through it is get a good doctor, get diagnosed, and know that pharmacology works -- don't be afraid of it,\" Bracco told AARP. \"The stigma of it stopped me at first. Stupid. And talk therapy is major. You're worth it, you're worth having a good day, every day.\"\nLORRAINE BRACCO DISCUSSES HER DEPRESSION\n\"The Sopranos\" creator David Chase originally envisioned Bracco taking on the role of Carmela Soprano, the wife of series lead Tony Soprano (James Gandolfini), when he asked her to audition.\nBracco had previously received an Academy Award nomination and a Golden Globes nod for her performance as Karen Hill, the wife of real-life mobster Henry Hill (Ray Liotta) in Martin Scorsese's 1990 gangster movie \"Goodfellas.\"\nHowever, Bracco turned down the part and expressed her interest in playing Dr. Melfi. During a 2020 interview with USA Today, Bracco explained why she had rejected the role of Carmela, which went to Edie Falco.\n\"Look, Carmela was a great character,\" she said. \"When I read the script, I said, 'I don't really want to play Carmela.' I wanted to play Melfi, because it was different for me and not just the mob wife. David was like, 'Really?' He was surprised I wanted to play Melfi, because it was a much smaller role and wasn't the lead. But I said, 'Yeah, I could do a very good job.'\" \nBracco played Tony Soprano's psychiatrist, Dr. Melfi, in \"The Sopranos.\" ( Anthony Neste/Getty Images)\nFrom 1999 to 2001, Bracco received three consecutive Emmy Award nominations for outstanding lead actress in a drama series for her performance as Melfi, as well as best actress Golden Globe Awards nods in 2000, 2001 and 2002.\nIn 2000, she lost the Emmy Award to her co-star Falco. Bracco was nominated for Best Supporting Actress Emmy in 2007 after she portrayed Melfi in the final season of \"The Sopranos.\"\nDuring a 2006 interview with The New York Times, Bracco shared how starring on \"The Sopranos\" had alleviated some of the financial burden that she still carried due to the custody battle.\n\"The show was a blessing,\" she said. \"It gives me huge financial security. It meant I could think, 'Oh, my God! I can go to work next year; I don't really have to worry.'\"\nBracco starred in the hit show throughout its six-season run from 1999 to 2007. While speaking with AARP, the Brooklyn native shared that fans still recognize her from her role on the acclaimed series.\n\"Last year was the 25th anniversary of 'The Sopranos,' and people still call out, 'Hey, Doc!' when they see me on the street,\" she said. \"I love it. It means my role as Dr. Melfi meant something to them.\"\nShe received four Emmy Award nominations and three Golden Globe Awards nods. (Getty Images)\nHowever, Bracco explained that her nostalgia over some of her most famous projects is often bittersweet after the deaths of Gandolfini and Liotta. In June 2013, Gandolfini died following a heart attack at the age of 51. Liotta passed away due to respiratory and heart problems at age 67 in May 2022.\nLIKE WHAT YOU'RE READING?

I lost two people whom I worked with, whom I adored, whom I would jump up in the air and hug and kiss whenever I saw them. That's what I think about.\"\nBracco starred with Ray Liotta in \"Goodfellas.\" ( Richard Corkery/NY Daily News Archive via Getty Images)\nFor her latest project, Bracco ventured into the comedy genre for the first time in her career. The actress is starring as Roberta in the upcoming Netflix movie \"Nonnas.\" Based on a real-life story, \"Nonnas,\" which is the Italian word for \"grandmothers,\" follows Joe Scaravella (Vince Vaughn) \"who realizes he's wasted time as a single man at a dead-end job and yearns for a second chance, so he opens a restaurant and hires a group of grandmothers as chefs,\" according to a plot synopsis. \n\"I've never, ever done a comedy before, so this was big for me. I was nervous; I didn't know where to start,\" Bracco told AARP. \nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER\nShe continued, \"The director (Stephen Chbosky) gave me these ugly glasses, and I said: 'I look terrible, what are you doing to me?' He said, 'Lorraine, trust me.' He was hysterical, laughing behind the camera. Vince Vaughn kept saying, 'Lorraine, you're doing great! Just commit! Believe!'\"\n\"It's a character that, never in a million years, I thought I'd play,\" Bracco added.\nThe actress is starring in her first comedy \"Nonnas.\" ( Dia Dipasupil/Getty Images for SCAD)\nMeanwhile, Bracco told the outlet that she is enjoying her real-life role as a grandmother to her daughter Margaux's two children. \n\"Being a grandmother is so much fun, because you relive a part of you that's been dormant for a while,\" she said. \"We play, we read, we talk.
