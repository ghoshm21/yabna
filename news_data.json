      "content": "Watch CBS News \n Updated on: April 22, 2025 / 11:47 AM EDT\n / CBS News \n Pope Francis' funeral has been scheduled for 10 a.m. local time (4 a.m. Eastern) on Saturday in front of St. Peter's Basilica, the Vatican announced Tuesday, following a meeting of the College of Cardinals at the Catholic Church's city-state headquarters in the heart of Rome. The coffin carrying the pope, who died Monday morning after suffering a stroke and heart failure at the age of 88, will be brought in a procession Wednesday morning, accompanied by cardinals, to the basilica from his residence at Casa Santa Marta, where he died.\nThe pope's body was placed in his coffin in the chapel of the Santa Marta residence on Monday. On Tuesday, the Vatican released the first photos and video of Francis since his death, showing him in the wooden coffin wearing a red robe with the papal mitre on his head and a rosary intertwined in his hands. \nThe images showed cardinals and other church officials performing what the Vatican said was the formal Confirmation of the Pope's Death and praying over his body.\nCBS News correspondent Seth Doane said the intimate service at the Santa Marta hotel gave senior clergy and Vatican insiders a private chance to pay their respects to Francis. The Vatican's ornately attired Swiss Guards were, as ever, standing at attention by the pope's side.\nChurch officials also shared some details about the pope's final hours, describing \"a discreet death, almost sudden, without long suffering or public alarm.\"\nThe interim administrator of the Vatican, Cardinal Kevin Farrell, an Irish-American who will play a major role in the funeral and subsequent events in the coming weeks, will preside over the procession and the ritual transfer of the pope's body to St. Peter's Basilica.\nThe pontiff will lie in state ahead of his funeral at the basilica from Wednesday morning, the Vatican said. The funeral Mass will be celebrated three days later by the dean of the College of Cardinals, Giovanni Battista Re. The papal funeral is broken down into three separate phases, or \"stations.\" They are the preparation of the body, the viewing of the body, and then the burial.\nThe funeral at St. Peter's Basilica on Saturday will draw \"Patriarchs, Cardinals, Archbishops, Bishops, and priests from across the globe,\" the Vatican said. It will also be attended by a number of world leaders and other dignitaries.\nPresident Trump said Monday that he and first lady Melania would attend, as did Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and France's Emmanuel Macron. Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni was to attend, along with a number of other European heads of state, including U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Germany's outgoing Chancellor Olaf Scholz.\nAmong the first royals to confirm they will attend the funeral were King Philippe and Queen Mathilde of Belgium. The country's official Belga News agency confirmed that they would attend, noting the royal couple' social media post on Monday in which they honored Francis as, \"a great man, close to the most vulnerable and concerned with the problems of the world.\"\nKing Felipe VI and Queen Letizia of Spain were also planning to be at the funeral, the French news agency AFP said Tuesday, citing the royal palace in Madrid.\nKensington Palace said Tuesday that William, the Prince of Wales and heir to the British throne, would attend the pope's funeral on behalf of the U.K. royals, representing his father King Charles III. Charles, along with Queen Camilla, met with Francis at the Vatican less than two weeks before the pontiff died.\nRussia's President Vladimir Putin, who is currently the subject of an International Criminal Court arrest warrant over war crimes allegedly committed during his country's ongoing invasion of Ukraine, will not attend the pope's funeral, the Kremlin's chief spokesman said Tuesday.\n\"No. The president has no such plans,\" spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters when asked about Francis' funeral. The ICC warrant severely limits Putin's ability to travel internationally, as any nation that's a signatory to the U.N. court's founding charter is legally obligated to arrest him if he enters its territory.\nThe Reuters news agency said Brazil's President Luis Inacio da Silva and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen had also confirmed that they would attend the funeral. President Javier Milei of Argentina, where Francis was born in 1936, would also be at the funeral, according to his office.\nChina's government indicated Tuesday that no decisions had been made regarding which officials might attend the service at the Vatican.\nAfter the funeral Mass at St. Peter's, Pope Francis' coffin will be taken to the Basilica of St. Mary Major in Rome, where he will be entombed. The pope chose to be buried at the smaller basilica, which is about four miles away, outside the Vatican walls. He prayed at St. Mary's often, before and after international trips during his 12-year pontificate.\nBetween 15 and 20 days after the pope's death, the Cardinal Electors will gather at the Vatican and seal themselves off from the world behind the doors of the Sistine Chapel for the papal conclave, the centuries-old process of choosing the next pope. Only cardinals under the age of 80 -- currently a group of about 135 -- are eligible to vote in a conclave. \nThe meeting of the cardinals on Tuesday was the first in what will be a series of gatherings culminating with the conclave. John Allen, editor of the Catholic news website \"Crux,\" told CBS News that the cardinals who were already at the Vatican to attend Tuesday's meeting would soon be joined by others from around the world.\n\"The really important part of these meetings begin when cardinals begin giving programmatic talks about where they believe the church stands... and what the profile of the man is needed to carry it forward,\" Allen told CBS News about the process leading up to the conclave. \n\"Let's be clear: These are not the Iowa Caucuses. Nobody's going to be standing up, barnstorming on behalf of their preferred candidate,\" he said, adding that one can, however, \"read between the lines\" of the addresses delivered by the cardinals \"to figure out, 'he's probably talking about cardinal so-and-so, or he may be talking against cardinal, so-in-so... so this is as close to political sausage grinding as we're going to get in the process electing the next pope.\"\nFor the actual conclave, the cardinals will cast ballots inside the Sistine Chapel, out of public view, for their choice to lead the church, repeating the process until a candidate emerges with a two-thirds-plus-one majority. The paper ballots are burned after each round of voting, sending up black smoke to signal no choice has been reached yet, and finally white smoke to reveal that a new pope has been selected.\nTucker Reals is CBSNews.com's foreign editor, based in the CBS News London bureau.

Unity where there was discord. And the understanding that we are all equal, living in the same house, our planet, which urgently needs our care.\"\n\"With his simplicity, courage and empathy, Francis brought the issue of climate change to the Vatican. He vigorously criticized the economic models that led humanity to produce so many injustices. He showed that this same model is what generates inequality between countries and people. And he always stood by those who need it most: the poor, refugees, young people, the elderly and victims of war and all forms of prejudice,\" said Lula.\nDeclaring an official seven-day mourning period for the Catholic leader in Brazil, Lula said while Francis was gone, \"his messages will remain engraved in our hearts.\"\nMexico's President Claudia Sheinbaum, in a post on social media, mourned Pope Francis as \"a humanist who stood for the poor, peace, and equality.\"\n\"He left behind a great legacy of true love for one's neighbor.

His Holiness will be remembered for his compassion, his concern for the unity of the Church and for his tireless commitment to the common causes of all people of faith, and to those of goodwill who work for the benefit of others. His belief that care for Creation is an existential expression of faith in God resounded with so many across the world. Through his work and care for both people and planet, he profoundly touched the lives of so many.\"\nOn a personal note, the statement said the king and queen remembered \"with particular affection our meetings with His Holiness over the years and we were greatly moved to have been able to visit him earlier in the month.\"\nCharles was greeted by Francis at the Vatican in an encounter that appeared unlikely, as the British royals' long-scheduled visit to Rome came on the heels of Francis' most recent, five-week hospitalization. \nKing Charles has also suffered health problems recently and is still undergoing treatment for an unspecified form of cancer.\nThe White House posted on social media about Pope Francis' death, sharing two photos of the late pontiff with President Trump and Vice President JD Vance, along with the message: \"Rest in Peace, Pope Francis,\" followed by a cross emoji.\nRest in Peace, Pope Francis. pic.twitter.com/8CGwKaNnTh\nItalian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni said Monday that the news of Pope Francis' death \"saddens us deeply.\"\n\"I had the privilege of enjoying his friendship, his advice and his teachings, which never failed even in moments of trial and suffering,\" Meloni wrote in a social media post in Italian.\nMeloni said the world would follow Francis' teachings and \"seek the path of peace, pursue the common good and build a more just and equitable society.\"\n\"His teaching and his legacy will not be lost,\" said the Italian leader.\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron honored Pope Francis in a social media post on Monday.\n\"From Buenos Aires to Rome, Pope Francis wanted the Church to bring joy and hope to the poorest,\" Macron said in French. \"May this hope continually resurrect beyond him.\"\nIsraeli President Isaac Herzog sent his \"deepest condolences to the Christian world and especially the Christian communities in Israel -- the Holy Land -- on the loss of their great spiritual father, His Holiness Pope Frances,\" in a social media post on Monday.\nHerzog said Francis had been \"a man of deep faith and boundless compassion,\" who \"dedicated his life to uplifting the poor and calling for peace in a troubled world,\" and had seen \"great importance in fostering strong ties with the Jewish world and in advancing interfaith dialogue as a path toward greater understanding and mutual respect.\"\n\"I truly hope that his prayers for peace in the Middle East and for the safe return of the hostages will soon be answered,\" Herzog said. \"May his memory continue to inspire acts of kindness, unity, and hope.\"\nEuropean Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said Monday that the world was mourning the death of Pope Francis, who \"inspired millions, far beyond the Catholic Church, with his humility and love so pure for the less fortunate.\"\n\"My thoughts are with all who feel this profound loss,\" van der Leyen said in a statement posted on social media. \"May they find solace in the idea that Pope Francis' legacy will continue to guide us all toward a more just, peaceful and compassionate world.\"\nVice President JD Vance met Pope Francis on Easter Sunday during a three-day family visit to Rome.\nVance, who converted to Catholicism in 2019, also met with other church officials and Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni.\n\"It was an honor to meet with Pope Francis, Prime Minister Meloni, and Church officials in Italy this weekend,\" Vance said on social media overnight Monday. \"Visiting Rome with my family during Holy Week was an incredible experience.\"\nFollowing news of Francis' death, Vance wrote: \"My heart goes out to the millions of Christians all over the world who loved him.

May God rest his soul.\"\nRead more here.\nPope Francis died Monday at the age of 88, the Vatican said. He died almost a month after he was released from a Rome hospital where he was treated for five weeks for a respiratory infection that worsened into pneumonia.\nIn a statement announcing his death, Cardinal Kevin Farrell, Camerlengo of the Apostolic Chamber, said Francis' \"entire life was dedicated to the service of the Lord and of His Church. He taught us to live the values of the Gospel with fidelity, courage, and universal love, especially in favor of the poorest and most marginalized.\"\nBorn Jorge Mario Bergoglio in Buenos Aires, Argentina, in 1936, he was ordained as a priest in 1969, rising to become a Jesuit leader and Archbishop of Buenos Aires. He was created a cardinal by Pope John Paul II in 2001.\nWhen he was elected pope in 2013 -- the first ever from the Americas -- he chose to name himself after Francis of Assisi, the patron saint of Italy, known for his simplicity and humanity. Pope Francis often said he wanted \"a poorer Church\" and one that would \"include the excluded.\"\nHe led by example, living in a humble room at the Vatican rather than the lavish papal apartments, and demonstrating his compassion by dining with the homeless, washing inmates' feet, and providing a home in Italy for migrants and refugees.\nThe 88-year-old pontiff will leave a legacy as a relatively progressive pope. He sought to make the Catholic Church more inclusive, welcoming more women into leadership roles (though not the priesthood) and reaching out to LGBTQ people, famously saying, \"Who am I to judge?\" In doing so, he drew backlash not only from conservatives, but also liberals who argued he wasn't going far enough or fast enough to reform the two-millennia-old institution. \nHe also led the Church in its reckoning with years of child sexual abuse, though not always as aggressively as some critics hoped for.\nIn a 2024 interview with CBS News' Norah O'Donnell, Francis said the Church \"must continue to do more. Unfortunately, the tragedy of the abuses is enormous. And against this, an upright conscience, and not only to not permit it but to put in place the conditions so that it does not happen.\" \n Frank Andrews, \n Anna Matranga and\n\n Chris Livesay\n\n contributed to this report.\n \n Tucker Reals is CBSNews.com's foreign editor, based in the CBS News London bureau.

      "content": "Watch CBS News \n Updated on: April 21, 2025 / 11:35 PM EDT\n / CBS News \n Pope Francis, celebrated by many for his messages of inclusion and compassion, died on Monday at the age of 88, just one day after making a surprise appearance in St. Peter's Square at the Vatican. \nPope Francis is known by many as a symbol of unity and hope, and he showed grace and kindness to people around the world. Here are some of the most heartwarming and memorable moments from his 12-year papacy.\nPope Francis regularly held Mass for papal audiences at the Vatican. On more than one occasion, children have walked up to the altar during Mass -- and many times, the pope did not ask them to leave. \nIn 2019, a young girl wearing a shirt that read \"Love\" walked up to the pope during Mass, clapping and walking around. The pope motioned to security and said in Italian, \"Let her stay, God speaks for children, let her stay, let her stay,\" according to Reuters.\nSimilarly, in 2018, a young boy slipped away from his mother during Mass and walked around the pope's podium, touching a guard's spear. \"He is Argentinian and unruly,\" the pope joked to Georg Ganswein, prefect of the Papal Household, who was seated next to him, according to Reuters.\nThe pope told security to allow the boy to stay.\n\"This child cannot speak. He is mute. But he can communicate. He knows how to express himself,\" Pope Francis told the audience, according to Reuters. \"He is free, free and unruly. But he is free. He made me think of myself. Am I also so free in front of God?\" \nOn a trip with his family to Rome in 2018, a then-12-year-old boy with Down syndrome named Peter Lombardi had his wish fulfilled when Pope Francis stopped his popemobile and kissed him on the head. \nThe pope then allowed the boy, who had beaten leukemia, to come into the popemobile, the designated vehicle used by the pope during public appearances.\nIn a video captured by the family's tour guide, the boy's mother says Peter beat cancer \"by the Grace of God.\" \nPope Francis met the Harlem Globetrotters -- a team known for entertaining audiences with basketball tricks -- when they took their show to Rome in 2015. \nThe group made the pope an honorary member and gifted him with a No. 90 jersey with \"Pope Francis\" on the back. He even tried one of their signature tricks: spinning a basketball on his finger.\nPope Francis got to practice his ball-spinning skills again when the circus of Cuba visited Rome in 2019. \nThe group joined the pope during his weekly general audience, and a performer helped him spin a ball on his index finger.\nWhile celebrating circus performers in 2016, Pope Francis tried a more daring stunt: petting a tiger. \nThe pope held a jubilee for circus and carnival performers, street performers and more, congratulating them for bringing their art \"to the poor and the homeless, to prisoners, to disadvantaged young people.\" \n\"You do great things,\" he said during an address. \"You are 'artisans' of celebration, of astonishment; you are artisans of beauty: with these qualities you enrich the society of the whole world, also with the aspiration to nourish feelings of hope and trust.\"\nPope Francis often visited people with disabilities, recently visiting a center for blind children in Hungary in 2023 and the Irmas Alma School for children with disabilities in Dili, East Timor, in 2024. \nIn 2016, he was photographed blessing the eyes of a 5-year-old girl with a genetic disorder that leads to blindness. Lizzy Myers, from Ohio, had a bucket list to see the world before she completely lost her eyesight. Rome was on the list, and when her family visited, she got to meet the pope. \nIn 2019, Pope Francis welcomed the Christian motorcycle group Jesus Bikers from Austria and signed a Harley-Davidson -- which became known as a \"Holy Davidson\" -- for the group. \nIt was later auctioned off for more than $55,700, with the proceeds going toward building an orphanage in Uganda, according to BBC News.\nAs he recovered from abdominal surgery in 2023, Pope Francis used his time at Rome's Agostino Gemelli University Polyclinic hospital to visit pediatric cancer patients. \nAfter undergoing surgery to fix a hernia, the Vatican released pictures showing the pope in a wheelchair in a hallway of the pediatric oncology ward visiting children, their parents and medical staff.\nWhen he turned 87 on Dec. 17, 2023, Pope Francis celebrated with children at Santa Marta Dispensary, a medical facility in Vatican City that helps children and women in need. \nIn videos from the celebration, children sing \"happy birthday\" to the pope, who lets them take swipes of icing from his cake. \nPope Francis met Mattia Villardita, who visits children in the hospital while dressed in full costume as Spider-Man, when he attended his audience in 2021 in Vatican City. \nCaitlin O'Kane is a New York City journalist who works on the CBS News social media team as a senior manager of content and production.

In an statement released Monday, the Vatican said Francis died of a cerebral stroke, coma and subsequent irreversible heart failure.\n\"We don't have a lot of details,\" said CBS News chief medical correspondent Dr. Jon LaPook. \"But the bottom line is, you know, he had all these underlying conditions. He had the stroke, which is [when] you have too little blood supply to the brain. That can cause death in a number of ways, including shutting down the ability-- the centers in the brain that allow you to breathe normally, and even the centers that allow the heart to work correctly.\" \nThe pope, who had part of one lung removed as a young man, long battled health problems and was especially prone to respiratory illnesses. He was hospitalized for five weeks this winter after developing double pneumonia. \nIn July 2021, he spent 10 days in the hospital following intestinal surgery for a bowel narrowing. In March 2023, he was hospitalized for three days and received intravenous antibiotics for bronchitis. A few months later, in June 2023, he was back in the hospital to have surgery to remove intestinal scar tissue and repair a hernia in the abdominal wall. \nSince 2022, he often used a wheelchair, walker or cane due to knee injuries, and he had suffered recently from multiple falls.\nHere's a breakdown of his most recent bout of health challenges earlier this year:\nFeb. 6, 2025: Francis was diagnosed with bronchitis, but continued to hold daily audiences -- though he handed off his speeches for an aide to read aloud, saying he was having trouble breathing.\nFeb. 14, 2025: Francis was hospitalized to treat bronchitis and undergo diagnostic tests. A spokesperson said he was expected to be there for \"a few days.\"\nFeb. 17, 2025: Francis' respiratory tract infection presented a \"complex clinical picture\" that required further hospitalization, the Vatican said at the time. Vatican spokesman Matteo Bruni said tests indicated the pope was suffering from a \"polymicrobial respiratory tract infection\" that called for a further change in his drug therapy.\nFeb. 18, 2025: Francis developed bilateral pneumonia, meaning the pneumonia was in both of his lungs. The illness was discovered after Francis underwent a chest CT scan, the Vatican said. According to the statement, Francis was in a good mood and spent the day resting, praying and reading.\nFeb. 23, 2025: Francis remained in critical condition as blood tests showed early kidney failure. The Vatican said he remained alert and \"well-oriented.\" While he hadn't had any more respiratory crises since the night before, he was still receiving high flows of supplemental oxygen.\nFeb. 26, 2025: Blood tests confirmed a slight improvement in the pope's health, according to a Vatican update, and the slight kidney insufficiency detected a few days prior had receded. Francis continued to receive respiratory physiotherapy to help him expel fluid from his lungs.\nFeb. 28, 2025: Francis experienced a bronchospasm, which is when the muscles that line the airways in the lungs tighten. The incident caused him to inhale vomit, but he responded well to being treated with noninvasive mechanical ventilation, according to the Vatican. \nMarch 1, 2025: Pope Francis had a calm night after the bronchial crisis caused a setback to his recovery. In an update, the Vatican said he had coffee, read newspapers and was able to move and sit in his armchair.\nMarch 3, 2025: Francis suffered \"two episodes of acute respiratory failure\" over the course of the day, which the Vatican said were caused by \"significant accumulation of endobronchial mucus and consequent bronchospasm.\"\nMarch 8, 2025: The Vatican said Pope Francis was showing \"gradual, slight improvement\" amid his pneumonia treatment.\nMarch 10, 2025: Doctors said Pope Francis was no longer in imminent danger of death from pneumonia, but they decided to keep him hospitalized longer to receive treatment.\nMarch 14, 2025: Francis marked the 12th anniversary of his papacy from his hospital room. It was also the one-month mark since he was hospitalized.\nMarch 23, 2025: After five weeks, Francis left Rome's Gemelli hospital after surviving the life-threatening bout of pneumonia.\nMarch 26, 2025: An interview with Dr. Sergio Alfieri, the head of Pope Francis' medical team, revealed Francis came close to dying on two separate occasions before he was allowed to return to his home at the Vatican over the weekend. Alfieri told an Italian newspaper that the medical team even considered letting the pope die at one critical point on Feb. 28 when Francis had suffered a breathing crisis after inhaling his own vomit during a coughing fit. Alfieri described it as \"the worst\" day of the pope's 38-day hospitalization. \n The Associated Press and \n Anna Matranga\n\n contributed to this report.\n \n Sara Moniuszko is a health and lifestyle reporter at CBSNews.com.

      "content": "Watch CBS News \n Updated on: April 21, 2025 / 8:23 PM EDT\n / CBS News \n Rome -- He was a populist leader, often referred to as the \"People's Pope.\" As pontiff, Francis, who died Monday at age 88, sought to bring the Church closer to the people, stating early in his papacy that he wanted to have a poorer Church \"for the poor.\" He was known for being driven around in unflashy cars and for making folksy gestures, like taking trips into Rome to buy an item at the store.\nHe was brilliant at playing to the press, creating the sorts of photo-ops that would draw attention to his areas of interest. He'd often speak extemporaneously while on papal voyages, particularly toward the beginning of his papacy, fielding questions on the flight. \nThat made his papal trips a must-attend event for the press covering him. For those of us who got to travel with Pope Francis, we could see how he'd interact over the course of days with various dignitaries and his wider flock of the faithful. He'd appear particularly energized and engaged, lighting up when with children or in an audience with those who were cast aside, living on the margins of society.\nHe died just a day after surprising many with a brief appearance in St. Peter's Square on Easter Sunday, blessing thousands of people and sounding stronger as he did so than he had since his release from a Rome hospital at the end of March. \nWe wanted to look back on his papacy, his legacy, and also look forward to the next pope, so we asked veteran Vatican correspondent Francis X. Rocca to meet recently on the terrace of a convent in Rome, with a spectacular view out over St. Peter's Basilica, for a chat about Pope Francis.\nWe look back, and ahead. Below is a partial transcript from our conversation, which has been edited for clarity.\nSETH DOANE: What is Pope Francis' legacy?\nFRANCIS X. ROCCA: Well, I suppose it depends on whom you ask. I mean, for women, for example, he certainly was someone who brought women in the Vatican, and gave them higher positions than had ever been the case. It's still a relatively small number, but that was certainly a very dramatic change. For conservatives, he started by giving them heartburn and ended up by giving practically a heart attack. It was quite a dramatic confrontation. In some ways was a polarizing pope. At the same time that he really pushed the envelope and allowed things to be spoken about that had been considered closed, whether on sexual ethics, on medical ethics. ... In a way, because of his very informal style of discourse, talking to journalists, giving interviews, press conferences, he seemed to give permission to people to criticize him, too, even if that wasn't his intention. So the debate became much more heated during his pontificate.\nSETH DOANE: Why was Pope Francis seen as such a divisive figure? Why did conservatives dislike him?\nFRANCIS X. ROCCA: Well, I think there were a number of reasons. One is that he had a very loose attitude toward tradition, let's put it that way. From the very beginning, when he stepped out on the loggia in the front of St. Peter's Basilica, and he didn't wear the red cape that was customary on that occasion -- before he even said a word, already people started to get nervous, conservatives started to get nervous that he was just not going to respect tradition.\nAnd he broke it in small ways like that, but he also tested it in bigger ways. And, for example, relatively late in his pontificate, gave permission for the blessings of same-sex couples. They tried to present that as something that was consistent with tradition, but it certainly wasn't seen that way by conservatives. And especially in Africa, where basically all the bishops of sub-Saharan Africa protested and wanted a kind of exemption from this new permission, which is extraordinary. And that's just a very clear illustration how divisive things became, when you have an entire continent -- a continent where the Church is growing very quickly -- taking a completely different stand from other parts of the Church. That happened under Pope Francis, and it happened because he made a bold move.\nSETH DOANE: Conservative Catholics in America were some of his loudest critics.\nFRANCIS X. ROCCA: Yes, that's right. He had a the majority of the U.S. bishops were not on board with his priorities, I think that's pretty clear. The pope and his allies among the U.S. bishops, who are a minority, wanted to play down abortion. The pope hated abortion, but he wanted to play [it] down, with respect to social and environmental and economic issues, or at least put them on an equal plane. That's maybe the better way to put it. The U.S. bishops have for years said that opposition to abortion is their \"preeminent priority.\" And the pope and his allies didn't want that, and they weren't able to persuade the majority of U.S. bishops about that, and that became a very, very big point of tension.\nSETH DOANE: We traveled with the pope together. One of the things that struck me was how he was with kids -- he would kind of come alive in a way.\nFRANCIS X. ROCCA: He was very approachable. He was very informal. That was the -- one of the beguiling, charming things, charismatic things about him. His predecessors are -- John Paul was a very charismatic figure, very telegenic, but he was not so relaxed. And Pope Francis had an ordinary style that appealed to people.\nSETH DOANE: Pope Francis was known as the \"People's Pope.\" He was known to reach out to try to pull in the masses.\nFRANCIS X. ROCCA: Yeah. He was also a populist pope, with a kind of political resonance. His style was very much to try to have a bond with the people, with -- implicitly or sometimes not so implicitly, against the elites, in this case, the hierarchy: the bishops and the cardinals. He kind of played off of them. And he was always sort of suggesting that the elites, even the Diocesan clergy priests and parish priests, could be aloof from their people, could be too rigid, could be too attached to luxury or to privilege. And so he was always beating that drum and saying, \"No. I'm with the people.\"\nSETH DOANE: This pope tried to tackle sexual abuse issues within the clergy, within the Church. He tried to tackle the vast bureaucracy and economic issues in the Church. How did he do?\nFRANCIS X. ROCCA: Well, I -- his record on sex abuse was mixed. And I think actually not up to the level that people had expected of him. He had a kind of a distaste for disciplining the priests and bishops compared with his predecessor, Pope Benedict. Pope Benedict the high water mark in terms of discipline of abusive clergy. Pope Francis stepped back a bit from that. He got in trouble for that in Chile, when he was very stubbornly supportive of a bishop who'd been accused of covering up sex abuse. He finally backed down, but it was an embarrassment.\nSETH DOANE: What were some of the big issues under Pope Francis' papacy?\nFRANCIS X. ROCCA: Well, certainly a big issue was his relative leniency on questions of marriage, the family, and sexuality. The single most famous statement from his pontificate was the one he made at his very first press conference in 2013, which was, \"Who am I to judge?\" He was talking, in that case, about gay priests. But he could have been talking about divorced Catholics, whom he allowed to take communion, in many cases, which had not been the practice before. He could have been talking about Catholics who use contraception. Pope Francis didn't change teaching formally on any of these issues. But what he did was signal that it was OK to have different points of view about them, that it was not a priority -- that he was not censuring anyone. And, in fact, some of his advisors here explored, for example, the possibility of relaxing the ban on contraception that had been so controversial since Pope Paul VI had reaffirmed it in 1968. So those are some issues. \nAnother issue: He had a rapprochement with China, which was controversial, even among Chinese Catholics, where he ... agreed to share responsibility for choosing Catholic bishops in China with the Communist government there. And that was controversial. He felt that it was important to have dialogue and to keep the Church unified at some level, but a lot of the Catholics who resisted government control in China resented that and felt that he was selling them out.\nSETH DOANE: One of the regular criticisms of this pope was that he sowed confusion. Why was that heard so often?\nFRANCIS X. ROCCA: Well, he played with ambiguity. A lot of his statement were made in an informal manner at press conferences and in interviews, not in doctrinal documents that came out from the Vatican. And so therefore he, you know, when he says, \"Who am I to judge?\" -- well, what does that mean? Conservatives tried very hard to read that in a way very consistent with strict tradition. And you could if you wished. But the pope was very media savvy. He knew how his comments would play. He knew how his soundbites and headlines would play, and so when he made a statement like that, he knew that most people would read that as meaning that sexual morality, or at least in that case, was a matter of conscience, that people could follow their own conscience. That's not explicitly what he said, but when he said, \"Who am I to judge?\" he seemed to be saying, \"This is a private affair, this is someone with his own conscience.\" And that's how many people read it, even if he didn't explicitly say that.\nSETH DOANE: During his papacy, Pope Francis changed the feeling of the Church. You saw him driving around in simple cars, sometimes going out into Rome to buy something at a store. The feeling of who a pope is changed even in where he decided to live, at the Santa Marta Hotel, and not in the Apostolic Palace.\nFRANCIS X. ROCCA: Yeah, that's right, even wearing, you know, ordinary black shoes, or having his Argentinian passport renewed, wearing the white skull cap in the photo. That's true: He was definitely very deliberate. He wanted to make the pope seem more with the people, and to pull down some of the barriers. And that's why he had a very tactile, approachable style. It will be interesting to see if his successor feels the need to maintain that, or will go back to something more traditional and more formal.\nSETH DOANE: In the long arc of the Church's history, how much will Francis' papacy really have changed?\nFRANCIS X. ROCCA: Well, the long march of papal history is very long indeed. One thing is he was the first pope from the Americas, and the first pope from the Global South. So he'll always have a place in the history books for that reason. Beyond that, it depends on what happens next. I mean, if the next pope is going to carry forward his progressive approach, and if that's going to continue and change the Church, and Church teaching is going to change on things like women's ordination, you know, or homosexuality, if it's actually going to change, then he will be a historic figure in that respect. If we go back to something more traditional, then that will be a kind of an anomaly. But he will remain in the history books because of where he's from.\nSETH DOANE: Looking ahead to the next pope, did Pope Francis, if you will, \"stack the decks\" enough that the College of Cardinals is likely to go with a more progressive, more liberal pope? Or does the pendulum swing the other way? \nFRANCIS X. ROCCA: Well, that's always the big question. Certainly Pope Francis was notable, and even some of his supporters acknowledge this, in not choosing people who didn't agree with him as cardinals. He tended to choose people like that. On the other hand, he chose a lot of people from far-flung regions, from places that had never had a cardinal before, about whom we know very little, and probably Pope Francis didn't know very much either. So that's a bit of a wild card. There's also the issue that cardinals tend to be pretty conservative people -- \"conservative\" with a small \"c.\" They tend to want not to rock the boat too much, and Pope Francis rocked the boat continually.\nSETH DOANE: We could see a more conservative pope next?\nFRANCIS X. ROCCA: Certainly it's very possible that we'll see a pope with a more conservative temperament, a more conservative governing style, a more conservative communicative style. Maybe not a hard-right conservative, in terms of doctrine, we might not get that. But we might get someone who's going to -- the College of Cardinals wants to calm the waters. It's been a very turbulent period under Pope Francis, and so they might want someone who will just not speak quite so often to the press, not stir things up, not shake things up for a while. We could be looking at that.\nSeth Doane is an award-winning CBS News correspondent based in Rome, Italy since 2016.

The Vatican said Pope Francis died just after 7:30 a.m. local time on Monday, a day after he surprised many by appearing at St. Peter's Square at the Vatican on Easter Sunday to greet well-wishers.\nThe Vatican said in a statement later Monday that Francis died of a stroke that put him into a coma and led to irreversible heart failure.\nCardinal Kevin Farrell, Camerlengo of the Apostolic Chamber, formally announced the pope's death with a statement saying: \"At 7:35 this morning, the Bishop of Rome, Francis, returned to the house of the Father. His entire life was dedicated to the service of the Lord and of His Church. He taught us to live the values of the Gospel with fidelity, courage, and universal love, especially in favor of the poorest and most marginalized. With immense gratitude for his example as a true disciple of the Lord Jesus, we commend the soul of Pope Francis to the infinite merciful love of the One and Triune God.\" \nTributes praising his leadership and devotion quickly began to pour in from around the world.\nPope Francis had experienced a number of health issues in recent years, including two abdominal surgeries and several serious respiratory infections. He spent five weeks in the hospital in February and March 2025 with bronchitis that developed into pneumonia in both lungs. He marked the 12th anniversary of his papacy from his hospital room.\nThe pontiff was pushed in a wheelchair into the room for an interview at his Vatican residence with CBS News' Norah O'Donnell in April 2024. But while he was having difficulty walking, he spoke clearly during the hourlong conversation about his prayers for an end to the wars in Gaza and Ukraine. In more recent appearances, however, the pontiff clearly struggled for breath as he delivered planned remarks.\nAfter being elected by his fellow Catholic cardinals in 2013, he set the tone with his first official act as pope, reversing a centuries-old tradition -- by simply asking for help.\nNormally after a new pope is elected, they come out and bless the masses gathered at St. Peter's Square at the Vatican. But when Francis was elected, he came out and first asked the faithful to bless and pray for him.\n\"I want to ask you a favor,\" he said. \"Before the bishop blesses the people, I ask that you would pray to the lord to bless me.\"\nIt may seem a subtle change, but along with his familiar greeting and farewell to the crowd in Italian that day, it set the tone for his entire papacy. Pope Francis made it clear that he identified himself as a brother pilgrim, not as an imperial pope. He didn't want to keep leading a one-way monologue from the highest post in the Catholic Church, but a dialogue.\nAs pope, the man previously known as Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio chose to name himself after Francis of Assisi, the patron saint of Italy, known for his simplicity and humanity. \nThe first pope from the New World, born and raised in Argentina, he said he wanted \"a poorer Church\" and one that would \"include the excluded.\"\nHe set an example by choosing to live in Room 201 at the Santa Marta -- a small Vatican hotel usually used for visiting priests -- rather than in the lavish papal apartments used by his predecessors. Pope Francis carried his own bag, and walked across Rome to buy his own pair of glasses.\nHis desire to reach out to ordinary people sent the bulletproof \"popemobiles\" into storage.\n\"I cannot greet people from inside a sardine can,\" he famously explained, \"even if it is made of glass.\"\nHe became one of the most popular public figures in the world, regularly speaking up for the voiceless and leading by example -- whether that was by dining with the homeless, washing inmates' feet, or providing a home in Italy for migrants and refugees fleeing war or economic instability.\nPope Francis railed against consumerism and individualism, and he insisted that \"unfair economic structures\" were a violation of human rights.\nHe also pushed for progress in combating climate change, even publishing an encyclical -- a formal letter from himself to Catholic leaders around the world -- on the topic. And he reformed the Curia -- the central administration of the church -- allowing lay men and women to run Vatican offices, positions historically reserved for cardinals and bishops.\nHe continued to give his public prayers during the coronavirus lockdowns, but with crowds banned, \"the People's Pope\" was left to deliver his messages in an empty St. Peter's Square.\nWasting no time after getting his COVID vaccine, Pope Francis made a daring, first-ever papal visit to Iraq, despite immense security risks. In Mosul, where ISIS militants once ransacked churches, Pope Francis prayed in them.\nA few months later, his health finally caught up with him. He spent 10 days in a Rome hospital in July 2021 recovering from a scheduled surgery to remove part of his colon. It was the first time he was hospitalized after being named pope.\nIn 2022, a torn knee ligament forced him to finally slow down. He was using a wheelchair and canceling both Vatican celebrations and overseas trips, generating persistent rumors that Francis, like Pope Benedict XVI, would resign. When Benedict died, Francis presided over his funeral, the first time in modern history a pope has laid his predecessor to rest.\nOver time, Francis' papacy began to be defined by a topic he did not choose: the wave of clerical sex abuse scandals that stretched to the very highest levels of the Catholic Church. He was accused, at first, of being insensitive in his slow response to the crisis.\nThen he tried to take control of the narrative, notably summoning senior clerics from around the world to the Vatican in early 2019. From that meeting came new Vatican laws about sex abuse, and a mandate that every diocese set up a clear reporting process. He also abolished the top-level confidentiality of the \"pontifical secret,\" which had shrouded the sex abuse crisis in yet another layer of systemic secrecy.\nHis diplomatic skill was on display when he played a key role in restoring relations between the United States and its decades-old enemy, Cuba.\nHis' simple style was a product of his humble beginnings. He was born on Dec. 17, 1936, to an immigrant Italian railway worker and a housewife in Buenos Aires, Argentina. As a young man, he lost part of a lung to an infection. He worked at various menial jobs and studied chemistry.\nAfter being ordained as a priest at the late age of 32, he made visiting the slums of Buenos Aires and caring for the city's poor a feature of his ministry.\nDuring a press conference aboard one papal flight years later, he appeared to crack open a space for homosexuals in the church, with a single, highly symbolic phrase: \"Who am I to judge?\" he asked when a reporter fired him a question about LGBTQ rights.\nBut while he may have received widespread credit for changing the tone of the church when it comes to acceptance, the church's teachings and policy did not change.\nDespite drawing fire from Catholic conservatives for being too liberal, Pope Francis reaffirmed long-standing church doctrines opposing same-sex marriage, and on pretty much everything else from birth control to ordaining women.\nHe claimed that he only brought a small bag to the papal conclave in 2013 that saw him elected, because he expected to be going back home to Argentina.\nInstead, neither his life, nor the papacy, were ever the same again.\nChris Livesay is a CBS News foreign correspondent based in Rome. \n (c) 2025 CBS Interactive Inc.

      "content": "Watch CBS News \n Updated on: April 21, 2025 / 10:57 AM EDT\n / The Conversation \n Joanne M. Pierce is a professor emerita of religious studies at the College of the Holy Cross.\nThe 88-year-old pontiff had been well aware of his fragile state and advanced age. As early as 2015, Pope Francis had expressed the desire to be buried in the Basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore, a fifth-century church in Rome dedicated to the Blessed Virgin Mary. He was so devoted to Mary and her basilica that after each of his more than 100 trips abroad, he would visit it after returning to Rome to pray and meditate.\nNo pope has been buried in Santa Maria Maggiore since the 17th century, when Pope Clement IX was laid to rest there. \nI'm a specialist in Catholic liturgical history. In earlier centuries, papal funerals have been elaborate affairs, ceremonies befitting a Renaissance prince or other regal figure. But in recent years, the rites have been simplified. As Pope Francis has mandated, here are the steps that the ritual will follow. \nThe funeral rites take place in three parts, called stations. The first takes place in the pope's private chapel, after medical professionals have certified his death. Until recently, this stage had taken place at the pope's bedside.\nAfter the body lies in rest in the chapel, the cardinal serving as the pope's camerlengo -- the pope's chief of staff -- will make the arrangements for the funeral. He is also tasked with running the Vatican until a new pope is elected. The current camerlengo is Cardinal Kevin Joseph Farrell, appointed by Francis in 2019.\nAs has been done for centuries, the camerlengo will formally call the deceased pope by the full name given to him when he was baptized as an infant -- Jorge Mario Bergoglio. There are narratives or legends stating that, at this time, the pope was also tapped three times on the forehead with a small silver hammer. However, there is no documented proof that this was actually done in earlier centuries to verify a pope's death.\nTraditionally, another ancient rite will also take place after the declaration of the pope's death: the defacing of the pope's ring. Each pope wears a custom-made ring with an engraved image of a man fishing from a boat, hearkening back to the gospel of Matthew, where Jesus calls St. Peter a \"fisher of men.\" This Fisherman's Ring, with the name of the current pope engraved over the image, could act as a seal on official documents. The camerlengo will break Francis' ring and smash the seal with a hammer or other instrument to prevent any other person from using it.\nThe pope's apartments will also be locked, with no one allowed to enter; traditionally, this was done to prevent looting. \nThe deceased pope will be dressed in his simple white cassock and red vestments, then placed in a simple wooden coffin. This will be carried in procession to St. Peter's Basilica, where the public viewing will take place for the next three days. \nThe pope's body will be left in the plain, open casket during this viewing period in order to emphasize the pope's humble role as a pastor, not a head of state. The earlier practice would have been to place the body on top of a tall raised platform, called a catafalque; this ended with the funeral of Pope Benedict XVI in 2022.\nPope Benedict was also the last pope to be buried in the traditional three coffins of cypress, lead and elm. Two coffins contained specific documents about his pontificate; the first coffin also held the traditional three bags of coins -- gold, silver and copper -- representing each year of his pontificate.\nAt Francis' funeral, after the public viewing, a plain white cloth will be placed over the pope's face as he lies in the oak coffin, a continuing part of papal funerals. But this will be the first time that only a single coffin will be used; it will likely contain a document describing his pontificate and a bag of coins from his pontificate as well.\nThe funeral Mass will then be celebrated at St. Peter's, most likely inside because of the late winter weather, and there will likely be a crowd of believers outside, assembled on the plaza. The homily will reflect on the life and spirituality of the deceased pope; Francis himself preached at the funeral of his retired predecessor, Pope Benedict. And the future Pope Benedict, as Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, preached at the funeral of Pope St. John Paul II when Ratzinger was the leader, or the dean, of all senior church officials - what's known as the College of Cardinals. \nThe current dean is 91-year-old Cardinal Giovanni Battista Re, and it is unclear whether he will be able to continue this tradition due to his advanced age. Masses will continue to be said in Francis' memory for nine days after his death -- a period called the Novendialis. This ritual was inspired by an ancient Roman tradition prescribing a mourning period ending on the ninth day after a death. \nPopes in the past have been buried in several different places. Until the legalization of Christianity in the Roman Empire in the early fourth century, popes would be interred in the catacombs, the burial grounds on the outskirts of Rome. \nAfterward, popes could be buried in a number of different locations, such as the Basilica of St. John Lateran -- the official cathedral of Rome -- or other churches in and around Rome. A few were even buried in France during the 14th century, when the papacy moved to the French border for political reasons. \nMost popes are buried in the grottoes underneath St. Peter's, and since Pope Leo XIII's burial at St. John Lateran in 1903, every pope has been buried at St. Peter's. According to Francis' wishes, however, there will likely be a procession across Rome to Santa Maria Maggiore, including the hearse and cars carrying others who will attend this private ritual. \nAfter a few final prayers and sprinkling of holy water, the coffin will be placed in its final location inside the church. Only later will the area be opened to the public for prayers and veneration.\nAfter so many journeys from Rome to visit Catholic communities in countries across the globe, and so many visits to this basilica for prayer and meditation, it seems fitting that, at the end of his life's journey, Francis would make one last trip to the church he loved so much to be laid to rest forever.\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.\nCopyright (c)2025 CBS Interactive Inc.

The pope's death initiates a centuries-old process of rituals and traditions that culminates with a conclave, a gathering of the Church's current 135 Cardinal Electors who are sealed inside the Sistine Chapel to elect the next pontiff.\nHere's what's to come in the following days.\nThe pope was formally pronounced dead by the Cardinal Camerlengo -- currently Irish-born American Kevin Farrell -- who is one of the most important Vatican officials during the interregnum period. \nTraditionally, the camerlengo (chamberlain) would tap a silver hammer on the pope's head while calling out his baptismal name three times. The hammer is no longer used. Far more conventionally, an electrocardiogram was used to confirm John Paul II's death in 2005.\nFarrell then made a statement announcing the news: \"At 7:35 this morning, The Bishop of Rome, Francis, returned to the Father's house. His entire life was dedicated to the service of the Lord and His church.\"\nOnce the camerlengo pronounces the pope dead, and before sealing the papal apartment, he breaks the pope's Fisherman's ring and destroys the dies used to make the papal seal for apostolic letters, to symbolize the end of the pontificate.\nThese items will be buried with the pope. But first, the pontiff is transported to lie in state in St. Peter's Basilica. Hundreds of thousands of mourners descended on Vatican City after the death of Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI in 2022 to pay their respects. \nPope Francis's death will be followed by a nine-day mourning period called Novemdiales, a tradition that dates back to Roman times. \nVatican flags will fly at half-staff, and the bronze doors of St Peter's Basilica are closed.\nThe funeral must take place four to six days after the pope's death. Weather permitting, it will be held in St. Peter's Square. Most recent popes have asked to be buried beneath the Basilica there, but Francis said he would be laid to rest in Rome's St. Mary Major Basilica. He also asked to be buried in a simple wooden casket.\nThe papal funeral is broken down into three separate phases, or \"stations.\" They are the preparation of the body, the viewing of the body, and then the burial.\nAt the funeral, attended by kings, queens, heads of state and religious leaders, the coffin will be carried through the so-called \"door of death\" to the left of the main altar, and a single bell will toll. The coffin will then be taken in procession from St. Peter's to the Basilica of St. Mary Major in Rome for entombment.\nDuring the nine-day mourning period, cardinals from around the world gather in Rome and begin meeting in \"General Congregations,\" a sort of campaigning period where various papal candidates give speeches about their visions for the church, mapping out the direction they think it should take.\nBetween 15 and 20 days after the pope's death, voting will begin, as the Cardinal Electors of the papal conclave isolate themselves from the world and begin the centuries-old process of choosing the next pope. Only cardinals under the age of 80 -- currently a group of about 135 -- are eligible to vote.\nBehind closed doors in the Vatican's Sistine Chapel, the cardinals will cast ballots for their choice, repeating the process until a candidate emerges with a two-thirds-plus-one majority. The paper ballots are burned after each round of voting, sending up black smoke to signal no choice has been reached yet, and finally white smoke to reveal that a new pope has been selected.\nFrank Andrews is a CBS News journalist based in London. \n (c) 2025 CBS Interactive Inc.

      "content": "When the former Archbishop of Buenos Aires, Jorge Mario Bergoglio, left Argentina's capital to participate in the Vatican conclave to elect Pope Benedict XVI's successor, he did not know it would be the last time he would see his hometown.\nThe fact that Pope Francis never returned to his country after becoming the pontiff left some Argentines with a heavy heart.\nSpeaking on Monday, Archbishop of Buenos Aires Jorge Ignacio Garcia Cuerva said his parish were \"orphans of a father who profoundly loved his country and had to learn to become the father of the whole world\".\nHe also added that Francis becoming Pope \"cost us as Argentines a little bit... Bergoglio left us to become Francis\". \n It came as a surprise to many - including Bergoglio himself - that he was elected to the highest office in the Catholic Church in the first place.\nAt 76 years old at the time - one year older than the typical age of bishops and cardinals when they submit their resignation to the pope - he was not seen as a real candidate to fill the vacancy, according to analysts.\n\"When he left Buenos Aires for the conclave, he seemed somewhat sad; he was getting ready to retire in a room at the Priests' Home in the Buenos Aires neighbourhood of Flores,\" Guillermo Marco, a priest from the Archdiocese of Buenos Aires, told Argentine newspaper Clarin.\nHowever, Bergoglio would soon begin a papacy that lasted 12 years.\nHis death has been particularly keenly felt in his home country, where seven days of national mourning have been declared - as Argentina grieves a man many regarded as simple and humble, despite holding one of the most powerful offices in the world.\nThose qualities were praised by Elenir Ramazol, a nun who spoke to BBC Mundo during a vigil at the Buenos Aires cathedral on Monday.\nThe fact he did not return to his homeland was \"a sign of the total commitment he made to the whole Church, not just to his people, to his country\", Ms Ramazol said.\nGustavo Vera exchanged hundreds of letters with Francis, having become friends with him when he was still archbishop. He agreed that the pontiff always showed an enduring interest in what was happening in his home country.\n\"Sometimes he commented on soccer, sometimes on tango, sometimes on cultural events,\" Mr Vera, the leader of La Alameda, an Argentine anti-trafficking and slavery organisation, said. Francis followed Argentine news \"in detail\", he added.\nDuring his papacy, Francis visited four of the five countries that border Argentina - but never his home country, despite continuing to take a keen interest in it.\nHe was loved by many there who now mourn him, but others remember him as a controversial figure.\nThe initial pride felt by most Argentines after the announcement that a fellow countryman would be the first Latin American pope gave way to disenchantment among some over the years.\nA Pew Research Center survey suggested that the proportion of people who held a positive view of the pontiff fell from 91% in 2013 to 64% in 2024.\nOf six Latin American countries surveyed, the largest drop in favourable attitudes was recorded in Argentina.\nConservatives in Argentina accused him of undermining historical traditions they held sacred, while reformers hoped for more profound changes.\nCritics felt he failed to do enough to oppose the country's brutal military dictatorship in the 1970s and 1980s and to criticise the complicity of some figures in the Church.\nEvery time he was asked about a possible trip, Pope Francis gave vague answers.\n\"I would like to go. It's my people, but it hasn't been planned yet. There are several things to sort out first,\" he said the last time he was publicly asked about the subject, in September 2024.\nSome fellow Argentines found this hesitation difficult to understand.\nThe pontiff's absence has been felt more acutely in recent years, as Argentina has endured a profound economic crisis, with annual inflation reaching nearly 300% and a sharp increase in poverty.\nMr Vera suggests that Francis was planning to visit, but had not yet done so because he wanted to avoid his presence being used for political purposes.\n\"He always used to say he would go to Argentina when he felt that he was an instrument to bring about national unity, to help overcome the rift, to try to bring Argentines back together,\" Mr Vera said.\nThe \"rift\" refers to the vast, decades-long gulf in Argentine politics and society between supporters and opponents of the populist political movement Peronism, founded by late President Juan Peron in the 1940s.\nThere is a widespread belief in the country that Pope Francis was a Peronist - something he denied in a book in 2023, while adding: \"If we had a Peronist conception of politics, what would be wrong with that?\"\nThe comment was seized upon by conservative detractors who accused him of being too closely aligned with social justice causes and left-wing politics.\nBefore taking office, Javier Milei, the current president who has demonised left-wing politics, even called Pope Francis \"the representation of evil on Earth\" - although he softened his tone after coming to power.\nThe two had a cordial meeting in the Vatican and President Milei officially invited the pontiff to Argentina. And following the Pope's death, Milei said he was deeply pained by his loss, and praised the pontiff's benevolence and wisdom.\nSome Argentines accused him of being too close to Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, a divisive left-leaning populist politician, who was president from 2007 to 2015.\nBut according to Mr Vera, the Pope met with people \"from the whole political and social spectrum of Argentina\".\nThe late pontiff's friend also pointed out that, while there was some criticism of Pope Francis in the media and major urban centres, he was loved in other parts of the country.\nAlthough he maintained his connection with Argentina, Mr Vera said, Pope Francis no longer felt he belonged to just one country.\n\"Argentines believe he was Argentinian, but in reality, he was a citizen of the world,\" he added.\nIt is a view shared by Alejandra Castro, a social worker who was among the mourners who gathered on Monday night at Buenos Aires cathedral.\nArgentina was \"always in his prayers\", Ms Castro said. \"In one way or another, he was always present, and I think that shows that in his heart, Argentina was always present.\"\nBut Mr Vera acknowledged that not everyone felt the same way, and suggested it was up to Argentines to look within themselves for answers: \"Rather than blaming Francis, we Argentines should ask ourselves what we were doing that meant we did not deserve the Pope's visit.\"\nYou can get in touch by following this link\nPope Francis had a close relationship with Gaza's tiny Christian community and used his last address to call for a ceasefire.\nAhead of the funeral, the pontiff's body will lie in St Peter's basilica from Wednesday.\nThe Prince of Wales will represent the King at the funeral of Pope Francis at the Vatican on Saturday. \nSeveral names are in the fray as cardinals prepare to gather in the Vatican to elect Pope Francis' successor. \nHereford and Worcester church leaders say the late Pope has left a strong legacy.\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

      "summary": "Several names are in the fray as cardinals prepare to gather in the Vatican to elect Pope Francis' successor.",
      "content": "Who will be the next pope? The decision could have a profound impact on the Catholic Church and the world's 1.4 billion baptised Roman Catholics.\nIt also promises to be a highly unpredictable and open process for a host of reasons.\nThe College of Cardinals will meet in conclave in the Sistine Chapel to debate and then vote for their preferred candidates until a single name prevails.\nWith 80% of the cardinals appointed by Pope Francis himself, they are not only electing a pope for the first time, but will offer a broad global perspective.\nFor the first time in history, fewer than half of those given a vote will be European. \nAnd although the college may be dominated by his appointments, they were not exclusively \"progressive\" or \"traditionalist\".\nFor those reasons, it is harder than ever to predict who will be elected the next Pope.\nCould the cardinals elect an African or an Asian Pope, or might they favour one of the old hands of the Vatican administration?\nHere is a selection of names being mentioned as Francis's potential successor, and we expect more to emerge in the coming days.\nPietro Parolin\nNationality: Italian\nAge: 70\nSoftly spoken Italian Cardinal Parolin was the Vatican's secretary of state under Pope Francis - making him the Pope's chief adviser. The secretary of state also heads the Roman Curia, the Church's central administration.\nHaving acted effectively as deputy pope, he could be considered a frontrunner.\nHe is viewed by some as more likely to prioritise diplomacy and a global outlook than the purity of Catholic dogma. His critics consider that a problem, while his supporters see a strength.\nBut he has been critical of the legalisation of same-sex marriage around the world, calling a landmark 2015 vote in favour in the Republic of Ireland \"a defeat for humanity\".\nThe bookmakers may back him but Cardinal Parolin will be well aware of an old Italian saying that stresses the uncertainty of the pope-picking process: \"He who enters a conclave as a pope, leaves it as a cardinal.\"\nSome 213 of the previous 266 popes have been Italian and even though there has not been an Italian pope in 40 years, the pivot of the upper echelons of the Church away from Italy and Europe may mean there may not be another for now.\nLuis Antonio Gokim Tagle\nNationality: Filipino\nAge: 67\nCould the next pope come from Asia?\nCardinal Tagle has decades of pastoral experience - meaning he has been an active Church leader among the people as opposed to a diplomat for the Vatican or cloistered expert on Church law.\nThe Church is massively influential in the Philippines, where about 80% of the population is Catholic. The country currently has a record five members of the College of Cardinals - which could make for a significant lobbying faction if they all back Cardinal Tagle.\nHe is considered a moderate within the Catholic definition, and has been dubbed the \"Asian Francis\" because of a dedication to social issues and sympathy for migrants that he shared with the late pope.\nHe has opposed abortion rights, calling them \"a form of murder\" - a position in line with the Church's broader stance that life begins at conception. He has also spoken against euthanasia.\nBut in 2015 when he was Archbishop of Manila, Cardinal Tagle called for the Church to reassess its \"severe\" stance towards gay people, divorcees and single mothers, saying past harshness had done lasting harm and left people feeling \"branded\", and that each individual deserved compassion and respect.\nThe cardinal was considered a candidate to be pope as far back as the 2013 conclave in which Francis was elected.\nAsked a decade ago how he viewed suggestions he could be next, he replied: \"I treat it like a joke! It's funny.\"\nFridolin Ambongo Besungu\nNationality: Congolese\nAge: 65\nIt's very possible the next Pope could be from Africa, where the Catholic Church continues to add millions of members. Cardinal Ambongo is a leading candidate, hailing from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).\nHe has been Archbishop of Kinshasa for seven years, and was appointed cardinal by Pope Francis.\nHe is a cultural conservative, opposing blessings for same-sex marriage, stating that \"unions of persons of the same sex are considered contradictory to cultural norms and intrinsically evil\".\nThough Christianity is the majority religion in the DRC, Christians there have faced death and persecution at the hands of jihadist group Islamic State and associated rebels. Against that backdrop, Cardinal Ambongo is viewed as a fierce advocate for the Church.\nBut in a 2020 interview, he spoke in favour of religious plurality, saying: \"Let Protestants be Protestants and Muslims be Muslims. We are going to work with them. But everyone has to keep their own identity.\"\nSuch comments could lead some cardinals to wonder if he fully embraces their sense of mission - in which Catholics hope to spread the Church's word throughout the world.\nPeter Kodwo Appiah Turkson\nNationality: Ghanaian\nAge: 76\nIf chosen by his peers, the influential Cardinal Turkson would likewise have the distinction of being the first African pope for 1,500 years.\nLike Cardinal Ambongo, he has claimed not to want the job. \"I'm not sure whether anyone does aspire to become a Pope,\" he told the BBC in 2013.\nAsked if Africa had a good case to provide the next Pope based on the Church's growth on the continent, he said he felt the Pope shouldn't be chosen based on statistics, because \"those types of considerations tend to muddy the waters\".\nHe was the first Ghanaian to be made a cardinal, back in 2003 under Pope John Paul II.\nLike Cardinal Tagle, Cardinal Turkson was considered a potential Pope a decade later, when Francis was chosen. In fact, bookmakers made him the favourite ahead of voting.\nA guitarist who once played in a funk band, Cardinal Turkson is known for his energetic presence.\nLike many cardinals from Africa, he leans conservative. However, he has opposed the criminalisation of gay relationships in African countries including his native Ghana.\nIn a BBC interview in 2023, while Ghana's parliament was discussing a bill imposing harsh penalties on LGBTQ+ people, Turkson said he felt homosexuality should not be treated as an offence.\nBack in 2012, he was accused of making fear-mongering predictions over the spread of Islam in Europe at a Vatican conference of bishops, for which he later apologised.\nAhead of the funeral, the pontiff's body will lie in St Peter's basilica from Wednesday.\nHereford and Worcester church leaders say the late Pope has left a strong legacy.\nThe 88-year-old's death has set in motion the centuries-old process of electing a new Pope.\nYork Mosque says it \"extends its sincere condolences to Christian neighbours and communities\".\nA group of 100 children will travel from Swindon to the Vatican to pay their respects to Pope Francis.\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

The potential candidates include Pietro Parolin, Luis Antonio Gokim Tagle, Fridolin Ambongo Besungu, Peter Kodwo Appiah Turkson, and others.  While some cardinals may favor a more diplomatic approach (Parolin), others lean towards traditionalist views (Ambongo).  The selection process is expected to be complex as the cardinals consider various factors like global perspective, social issues, and cultural norms.

      "content": "Watch CBS News \n Updated on: April 22, 2025 / 9:58 AM EDT\n / CBS News \n Pope Francis' death on Monday, the day after Easter Sunday, started off a series of traditions that in a few weeks will culminate in a vote for the next pope.\nAfter Pope Francis is laid to rest, his successor will be decided by the Catholic Church's Cardinal Electors, a group of about 135 cardinals under the age of 80, who are expected to begin their conclave in early to mid-May to hold a secretive election for the next pontiff.\nOver the last 600 years -- since 1378 -- cardinals have been chosen for the position, although eligibility technically extends to any male Roman Catholic who has been baptized.\nHere is look at some of the cardinals considered possible contenders to become pope:\nCardinal Peter Erdo, a 72-year-old canon lawyer, is the highest ranking Catholic leader in a country that is 80% Christian. He is known for his support of the pope's outreach to Orthodox Christians.\nErdo is also on the conservative side of the European cultural divide. On migration, a key issue for Hungary, he has conveyed a balanced approach, recognizing the right to migrate but also the importance of ensuring political stability. \nErdo is considered a traditionalist but is also respected by liberals, which could make him a unifying force within the church. \nCardinal Fridolin Ambongo, president of the Symposium of Episcopal Conferences of Africa and Madagascar, grew global attention for leading African bishops in unanimous rejection of \"Fiducia Supplicans,\" a declaration the Vatican issued in 2023 that included guidelines on the blessings of people in same-sex relationships.\nAt 65 years old, he is known as a supporter of orthodoxy and defends priestly celibacy and the Church's moral teachings. He is also known as a promoter of social justice and a champion of the poor and voiceless, and is outspoken in his criticism of the Congolese government. \nCardinal Mario Grech, 68, is a canon lawyer who has major influence on how synods in the church are run. Supporters have praised him for leading the charge in implementing a more consultative and inclusive approach to church governance. \nGrech comes from Malta, which is one of the smallest countries in the world. \nCardinal Pietro Parolin, 70, is second-in-command at the Vatican and a career diplomat who has consistently risen above any turbulence marking the pontificate. \nHe is regarded as a moderate who, if elected, could repair rifts inside the church. He is also considered a progressive with a global vision. \nCardinal Pierbattista Pizzaballa, 60, is a pastoral candidate who has spoken out amid the Israel-Hamas war and visited Gaza during the conflict. \nHe is a proponent of social justice and sees himself as a servant of the people. He is similar to Francis in his concern for migrants, interfaith dialogue and his disdain for clericalism. \nCardinal Luis Tagle, 67, and pro-prefect for the Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples, is known as the \"Asian Francis\" for his missionary spirit as well as his emphasis on caring for the poor and welcoming of LGBTQ and divorced and remarried Catholics.\nHe is the former archbishop of Manila, in the Philippines, which is one of the most Catholic countries on the continent of Asia, and studied in the U.S. for seven years. His election would signal a continuation of Francis' pontificate. \nCardinal Matteo Zuppi, 69, is the president of the Italian bishops conference. He is known as a \"street priest\" and missionary and wants a church that listens to the faithful and is willing to modernize. Zuppi is inclusive of same-sex couples, as well as people of different religions.\nFrancis chose Zuppi as his envoy to Russia and Ukraine, as well as to the West Bank and Beijing, to promote peace. \nCardinal Anders Arborelius, 75, was raised Lutheran and converted to Catholicism at the age of 20. He is the first ever cardinal from Scandinavia. \nHe is also a traditionalist on the church's teaching on sexual ethics and gender, and has a strong concern for the environment. \nArborelius has been a proponent of immigration into Sweden, calling for dialogue and integration instead of restrictions.\nCardinal Gerald Cyprien Lacroix, Metropolitan Archbishop of Quebec, Canada, is 67 years old. Earlier in his career he spent years as a missionary and seminary professor in Colombia. \nHe temporarily stepped back from his duties amid sexual abuse allegations, which he denied, and returned to his duties last year after a church-led investigation found no evidence of misconduct. \n (c) 2025 CBS Interactive Inc.

Reports suggest that there are a large number of wounded, with some in critical condition. \nIndia's Prime Minister Narendra Modi said the perpetrators would \"be brought to justice\".\n\"Our resolve to fight terrorism is unshakeable and it will get even stronger,\" Modi wrote in a statement on X.\nHome Minister Amit Shah travelled to Srinagar, Kashmir's largest city, on Tuesday to hold an emergency security meeting.\nThe region's Lieutenant Governor, Manoj Sinha, said the army and police had been deployed to the scene. \nNo group has claimed responsibility for the attack. There has been a long-running insurgency in the Muslim-majority region since 1989, although violence has waned in recent years.\nThe attack took place in Baisaran, a mountain-top meadow three miles (5km) from Pahalgam. \nVehicles are unable to reach the area where the shooting occurred, Inspector General of Jammu and Kashmir Police Vidi Kumar Birdi told BBC Hindi.\nA tourist from Gujarat, who was part of a group that was fired upon, said that chaos broke out after the sudden attack, and everybody started running, crying and shouting.\nVideo footage shared by Indian media outlets appears to show Indian troops running towards the scene of the attack, while in other footage victims can be heard saying that the gunmen had singled out non-Muslims. \nFootage on social media, which has not been verified by the BBC, appears to show bodies lying on a meadow with people crying and pleading for help.\nPolice said multiple tourists had been taken to hospital with gunshot wounds. The area has been cordoned off and soldiers are stopping vehicles at checkpoints. A joint search operation by the Indian army and Jammu and Kashmir police is ongoing.\nSeveral protests have been organised for Wednesday.\nSince the 1990s, an armed separatist insurgency against Indian rule in the region has claimed tens of thousands of lives, including those of civilians and security forces.\nThe Himalayan region was divided following India's independence from Britain, partition and the creation of Pakistan in 1947. \nThe two nuclear-armed states both claim the region in its entirety and have fought two wars and a limited conflict over it in the decades since.\nSome 500,000 Indian soldiers are permanently deployed in the territory.\nWhile fighting has decreased since Modi revoked Kashmir's partial autonomy in 2019, there are still incidents of violence.\nThe last major attack on civilians occurred in June 2024 when nine people were killed and 33 injured after militants opened fire on a bus carrying Hindu pilgrims. \nIn 2019, a suicide bombing in Indian-administered Kashmir killed at least 46 soldiers and prompted Indian airstrikes on targets in Pakistan.\nPahalgam is a popular tourist destination, both domestically and internationally, and in recent years the government has attempted to encourage further tourism to the region.\nAround 3.5 million tourists visited Kashmir in 2024, according to official figures.\nUS Vice-President JD Vance is currently on a four-day visit to India with his wife and three children.\nRamdev had alleged that an unnamed rival brand used its profits to build mosques and madrassas.\nThe talks are likely to focus on fast-tracking a trade deal, earlier expected to conclude by the end of 2025.\nIndia's roads claimed over 172,000 lives in 2023 - averaging 474 deaths daily, or one every three minutes.\nIn Pakistan, it's hoped newly-developed AI cameras could warn villagers via text to move their livestock if snow leopards enter the area. \nCopyright 2025 BBC.

      "content": "Watch CBS News \n Updated on: April 22, 2025 / 3:38 PM EDT\n / CBS News \n New Delhi -- At least 20 tourists were killed and many others injured Tuesday when suspected militants opened fire on civilians in Indian-controlled Kashmir, according to reports on Indian and international media. Many outlets, including the French news agency AFP, cited unnamed security officials who put the death toll as high as 26, but there was no immediate confirmation on casualties from authorities.\nTwo senior police officers, who also spoke on condition of anonymity, told the Associated Press at least 20 bodies had been recovered after multiple gunmen fired at dozens of tourists from close range Tuesday. The officers said at least three dozen others were injured, with many in serious condition. \nThe attack took place in South Kashmir's Pahalgam area, a scenic destination dotted with meadows and glaciers that attracts hundreds of thousands of Indian and foreign tourists every summer. That tourist traffic has increased over the last year, as militant violence in the wider Kashmir region, which is disputed between India and neighboring Pakistan, has waned.\nPeople injured in Tuesday's attack were taken to nearby hospitals. Police, army and paramilitary forces launched a search operation to find those responsible for the attack.\n\"Our reports say that two-three militants appeared and opened indiscriminate fire at the tourists,\" The Indian Express newspaper quoted a senior police officer as saying, without naming him.\n\"The death toll is still being ascertained so I don't want to get into those details. They will be officially conveyed as the situation becomes clearer. Needless to say this attack is much larger than anything we've seen directed at civilians in recent years,\" Omar Abdullah, Chief Minister of Jammu and Kashmir, wrote in a post on social media. \nAbdullah called the attack \"shocking beyond belief\" and said no words of condemnation could be sufficient to chastise those behind the shooting.\nU.S. President Donald Trump pledged his support for India after the deadly attack.\n\"Deeply disturbing news out of Kashmir,\" Mr. Trump wrote on social media. \"The United States stands strong with India against Terrorism.\"\nThe attack came as U.S. Vice President JD Vance, along with his wife Usha and their children, paid a largely personal visit to India. Vance met earlier in the week with India's leader, Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Usha Vance is a practicing Hindu whose parents are from India.\nIt was the worst attack in the conflict-hit region in nearly a year, and it came at a time when tourism in Kashmir was recovering. The last major attack happened in June 2024, when nine people were killed and 33 injured as militants attacked a bus carrying Hindu pilgrims.\nEight pilgrims were killed and 19 injured in a similar attack in the region in 2017, when militants attacked a bus carrying them back from the famous Amarnath Cave Temple in south Kashmir.\nKashmir is claimed in full by both India and Pakistan, but each nation has controlled its own portion of the mountainous region for decades.\nThe scenic Himalayan region has been hit regularly by militant violence since an armed anti-Indian insurgency began in 1989. The simmering conflict has claimed tens of thousands of lives over more than three decades. \n\"I strongly condemn the terror attack in Pahalgam, Jammu and Kashmir. Condolences to those who have lost their loved ones. I pray that the injured recover at the earliest,\" Prime Minister Modi said in a social media post. \"Those behind this heinous act will be brought to justice... they will not be spared! Their evil agenda will never succeed. Our resolve to fight terrorism is unshakable and it will get even stronger.\"\nIndia's Home Minister Amit Shah said he would visit the region to review security measures. \n\"Anguished by the terror attack on tourists in Pahalgam, Jammu and Kashmir. My thoughts are with the family members of the deceased,\" Shah said in a social media post, adding: \"Those involved in this dastardly act of terror will not be spared, and we will come down heavily on the perpetrators with the harshest consequences.\" \n (c) 2025 CBS Interactive Inc.

      "ml_hf_summary": "On April 22, 2025, suspected militants opened fire on tourists in Pahalgam, Kashmir, killing at least 20 people and injuring many others. The attack occurred in a popular tourist destination that has seen increased visitor traffic due to the decline of militant violence in the region.  The death toll is still being confirmed, but authorities have recovered at least 20 bodies.  Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi condemned the attack and pledged to bring perpetrators to justice. U.S. President Donald Trump also expressed support for India against terrorism. The attack was the deadliest in Kashmir since June 2024 and highlights the ongoing conflict between India and Pakistan over control of the region. \n"

      "content": "A senior Palestinian official familiar with Israel-Hamas ceasefire negotiations has told the BBC that Qatari and Egyptian mediators have proposed a new formula to end the war in Gaza.\nAccording to the official, it envisages a truce lasting between five and seven years, the release of all Israeli hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails, a formal end to the war, and a complete Israeli withdrawal from Gaza.\nA senior Hamas delegation was due to arrive in Cairo for consultations.\nThe last ceasefire collapsed a month ago when Israel resumed bombing Gaza, with both sides blaming each other for the failure to keep it going.\nIsrael has not commented on the mediators' plan.\nMeanwhile, at least 26 Palestinians were killed and 60 others injured by Israeli air strikes across the Gaza Strip over the past 24 hours, the territory's Hamas-run health ministry said on Tuesday.\nLocal residents and eyewitnesses described the air strikes as \"extremely intense.\"\nAccording to witnesses, the attacks destroyed dozens of bulldozers and heavy machinery - equipment used by Hamas-run municipalities to reopen roads, clear rubble, and rescue victims trapped beneath the debris.\nIn a statement on Tuesday, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it had struck \"approximately 40 engineering vehicles used for terror purposes, including during the October 7th massacre\".\n\"Hamas has used these vehicles for planting explosives, digging underground routes, breaching fences, and clearing rubble to locate weapons and military equipment hidden by the terrorist organisation beneath the rubble,\" it said.\nTanks have also been seen moving in the southern part of Rafah city in the south of Gaza.\nAs Israel pushes on with its offensive, talks were due to take place in Cairo with Hamas represented at a senior level by the head of its political council, Mohammed Darwish, and its lead negotiator Khalil al-Hayya.\nThe meeting comes days after the movement rejected Israel's latest proposal, which included a demand for Hamas to disarm in return for a six-week truce.\nOn Saturday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he would not end the war before Hamas was destroyed and all the hostages returned. Hamas has demanded Israel commit to ending the war before the hostages are freed.\nThe Palestinian official familiar with the talks told the BBC that Hamas has signalled its readiness to hand over governance of Gaza to any Palestinian entity agreed upon \"at the national and regional level\". The official said this could be the West Bank-based Palestinian Authority (PA) or a newly formed administrative body.\nNetanyahu has ruled out any role for the PA in the future governance of Gaza, which has been ruled by Hamas since 2007.\nWhile it is still too early to assess the likelihood of success, the source described the current mediation effort as serious and said Hamas had shown \"unprecedented flexibility\".\nHamas attacked Israel on 7 October 2023, killing about 1,200 people - mostly civilians - and taking 251 back to Gaza as hostages. Israel launched a massive military offensive in response, which has killed 51,240 Palestinians - mainly civilians - according to Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry figures on Monday. \nElsewhere, the Palestinian Embassy in Cairo has instructed its staff - who had been co-ordinating medical evacuations from Gaza to Egyptian hospitals and facilitating the entry of humanitarian aid - to relocate with their families to the Egyptian city of Arish, near the Gaza border.\nPolice attended the scene as up to 20 protesters make their way into a BBC building in Belfast.\nFootage posted online shows a swimmer flailing in the distance as beachgoers yell in shock.\nAn Israeli military report said \"professional failures\" led to the killing of the 15 rescue workers. \nFourteen emergency workers and a UN worker were killed when the Israeli military opened fire on a convoy of vehicles in Gaza last month. \nThe BBC joins a GP in Gaza as she sees dozens of patients, struggling to treat them with a dwindling supply of drugs.\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

      "content": "As the threat posed by US President Donald Trump tops Canada's federal election agenda, the issue of the country's contribution to global warming has been largely overshadowed. \nThe two main contenders are pushing plans for new energy infrastructure as the country seeks to pivot away from its reliance on the US.\nMark Carney's Liberals are promising to make Canada a global superpower in both conventional and green energy. The Conservatives under Pierre Poilievre want to invigorate the oil and gas sector and scrap the industrial carbon tax.\nIt's a big shift from the 2021 election, when the environment topped the list of voter concerns.\nIn that vote, there was a consensus between the two major parties that Canada should rapidly transition to a green economy, with a net-zero emissions law passed in June of that year.\nThat sense of unity is now long gone.\nCarney, who became leader of the Liberals and prime minister in early March, has a long track record as an international champion of climate change.\nAs well as being a governor of the Bank of England, he was a UN Special Envoy on climate action and finance and was co-chair of the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero, one of the big outcomes of COP26.\nHowever, his first action as prime minister was to repeal the consumer carbon levy.\nThe tax - a signature climate policy of the governing Liberals - was introduced in 2019, and placed an added charge on consumers using coal, oil or gas products.\nIt was unpopular, and for the Conservatives it became an easy target of blame for the rising cost of living in recent years. Poilievre even sought to paint his rival as \"Carbon Tax Carney\".\nSome observers believe that cancelling the tax was a smart political move, others feel it was a mistake.\n\"By making one of your first moves the removal of the carbon price, you're accepting this narrative that climate change policy costs us too much money and isn't good for us, when, in fact, that is not the case,\" said Catherine Abreu, who is director of the International Climate Politics Hub and a member of Canada's Net Zero Advisory Body.\n\"I think there's a missed opportunity here to set a new narrative framework around this in the election.\"\nCarney's election pitch on energy is to turn Canada into \"a world leading superpower in both clean and conventional energy\".\nHe is emphasising his pragmatic approach, and his campaign talks about fast-tracking green energy projects and encouraging green transport and buildings, without giving too many details. He has also called for investment in technologies like carbon capture. \nThere are other important factors that have helped cool some of the Carney climate rhetoric.\nOpinion polls indicate that, since late 2023, Canadian concerns over the climate fell as worries over rising prices, energy and housing costs came to the fore. \nThe war in Ukraine has also put new emphasis on the country's bountiful natural resources in oil, gas and critical minerals.\n\"We have had a parade of geopolitical allies turning up on our doorstep saying, we want your rocks, we want Canada to be the geopolitically secure primary resource commodity provider, in place of Russia,\" said Mark Winfield, a professor in the faculty of environmental and urban change at Toronto's York University.\n\"And that's created another sort of dynamic in all of this, which was not present in previous elections.\"\nPierre Poilievre is the man seeking to replace Carney as PM.\nHe is running on cost of living issues, and advocating for tougher policies on law and order and what he considers \"woke\" cultural issues.\nPoilievre, whose party has a strong voter base in energy-rich regions of the country, is pushing for a major expansion of the oil and gas industries and the removal of the carbon tax on industry.\nWhile he has remained tight-lipped on whether he supports Canada's net-zero goals, he has argued that it would be better for the world if India and other Asian countries were to replace \"dirty coal\" with cleaner Canadian oil and gas.\nAccording to Prof Winfield, the Conservative proposals to boost oil and gas is likely to prove attractive to voters, even if the merits of expanding production don't stand up to scrutiny.\nHe told the BBC it's more \"at the in-principal level as a response to Trump, as opposed to any real thinking through of what are the implications on climate, and whether this is actually economically viable\". \nRegardless of climate or energy, the key question in the minds of voters in this election is which leader is best placed to deal with the combative US president.\nThat is especially important when it comes to the oil and gas industry.\nCanada is America's largest foreign supplier of oil, with around 90% of crude production heading south of the border, and the impact of energy tariffs could well be disastrous for jobs and the economy.\n\"Our relationship with the US has completely changed,\" Carney said last week in the first of two election debates. \n\"The pipelines are a national security problem for us.\"\nThat concern over US dependence has revived interest in pipelines that would move oil and gas from the western provinces, where they are mainly produced, to the east, where they could be exported to new overseas markets.\nA previous attempt called the Energy East pipeline was shelved in 2017 due to a number of factors, including fierce opposition from some regions of the country and regulatory hurdles. \nIn this campaign, both the Liberals and Conservatives have promised to fast track \"energy corridors\", though Carney has flip-flopped on his support for pipelines, knowing they are deeply unpopular with environmentalists.\nHe is trying to walk a fine line between defending Canada as a nation under threat from Trump, and taking action on a warming climate.\nThe Insurance Bureau of Canada reported that in 2024, there were C$8.5bn ($6.1bn; PS4.6bn) in weather-related insured losses, triple the figure for 2023.\nAnd while the two election frontrunners are advocating a major role for fossil fuels in Canada's economy, this approach will clash head on with the country's climate commitments.\nYves-Francois Blanchet, leader of the Bloc Quebecois, a federal party based in Quebec, has accused the pair of being in a \"denial situation about climate change\".\n\"I'm sorry to crash your party guys, but you are telling fairy tales\" about clean oil and gas, he said in last week's debates.\nCanada has promised on the international stage to curb carbon emissions by 40-45% by 2030 based on the levels in 2005.\nAs of 2023, carbon output was only down 8.5%.\nWhoever wins the election will have a real challenge to square that circle.\nCanadians go to the polls on 28 April.\nAn Australian barista in Toronto was told to stop selling jars of spread - but received support from a powerful ally. \nPope Francis visited the US, Mexico and Canada on different occasions before his death at the age of 88. \n Seven voters across the political spectrum took us into their thoughts after watching candidates debate.\nThere were two ghosts in the room during Canada's federal election debate - Justin Trudeau and Donald Trump.\nFour party leaders faced off on Donald Trump, tariffs and security in the only English debate before Election Day.\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

      "ml_hf_summary": "Canada's upcoming federal election is dominated by the US-China relationship and energy policy.  Liberal leader Mark Carney emphasizes a focus on green energy, aiming to position Canada as a global superpower in both conventional and clean energy. Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre advocates for increased oil and gas production and removal of the carbon tax, appealing to voters concerned about rising costs. This shift from environmental concerns in 2021 is driven by factors like the war in Ukraine and US pressure on Canada's energy sector.  The election will be crucial as it determines how Canada navigates its relationship with the US and addresses climate change commitments. The outcome of the election will have significant implications for Canada's energy policy, international relations, and environmental goals. \n"

      "content": "Russia's ceasefire in Ukraine lasted only 30 hours, and even then it appears to have been very limited in scope, with accusations of violations on both sides.\nKyiv said there had been no \"air raids alerts\" on Sunday during Vladimir Putin's \"Easter truce\" and President Volodymyr Zelensky suggested this could be the \"easiest\" format to extend for 30 days and possibly more.\nThe US had tried to organise a 30-day ceasefire but that never took hold, and this latest chapter underscores the difficulty in achieving even a brief pause in fighting,\nRussia insisted on a number of conditions, including a halt to Ukraine re-arming and recruiting new fighters as well as \"underlying causes of the conflict\".\nOne major factor hampering the talks' progress is the long history of broken ceasefire deals, resulting in deep mistrust between the two neighbours.\nDuring his tempestuous meeting with Donald Trump in February, Zelensky accused Russia of violating 25 ceasefire agreements since 2014, and argued that no such deal would hold without security guarantees.\nIn turn, Russia accuses the Ukrainian president of being \"incapable\" of implementing any such agreements.\nIndependent experts say Russia bears the brunt of the blame for broken truces, even though Ukraine bears some responsibility, too.\nStatements by current and former Russian officials also indicate that Moscow would be prepared to cease hostilities, only if its original objectives are achieved - namely a demilitarised, neutral and non-nuclear Ukraine.\nBy invading Ukraine in 2014, Russia violated the Agreement on Friendship, Cooperation and Partnership between the two countries signed in 1997. Article 2 said the sides \"respect each other's territorial integrity and confirm the inviolability of existing borders between them\".\nThe war has been rife with accusations of treachery from the very beginning. \nGen Viktor Muzhenko, the chief of Ukraine's General Staff at the time, accuses Russia of going back on agreements allowing Ukrainian troops to pull out from the eastern town of Ilovaysk in August 2014. \nAs a result, withdrawing convoys came under fire, and at least 366 Ukrainian fighters were killed.\nThe first major ceasefire agreement, signed on 5 September 2014 in Minsk, was broken within hours of being signed, with Ukrainian sources reporting attacks by Russian proxy forces on Donetsk airport. Attacks on other Ukrainian towns in the region, such as Debaltseve, continued, too.\nThis prompted the second attempted truce, known as Minsk-2, but it was even shorter. \nWithin minutes of it going into effect on 15 February 2015, observers from the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) reported mortar and artillery fire in Donetsk. They were deployed to the war zone at Ukraine's request to monitor the security situation including any ceasefire violations, but they did not explicitly say who committed them.\nWhat followed was a string of other failed ceasefire attempts. Again, some were broken within minutes of coming into force.\nThey included Easter truces in 2016, 2017 and 2018, the \"school ceasefires\" of 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018 which were meant to allow schoolchildren near the frontline to go back to school in September, Christmas and New Year ceasefires in 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018, and the \"bread ceasefires\" of 2017, 2018 and 2019 to allow the harvesting of grain, and others.\nA \"comprehensive ceasefire\" that went into effect on 27 July 2020 only lasted 20 minutes, according to Kyiv. Still, it had an effect on the fighting, halving the number of fatalities among Ukrainian soldiers in the following year.\nMatthew Savill, director of military sciences at the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) in London, argues that Russia has never entered ceasefire talks in good faith.\n\"Russia has never been sincere about removing or ending the risk of the use of force in seeking its objectives,\" he says.\nBecause of various ceasefire agreements between Ukraine and Russia, \"the level of fighting has ebbed and flowed, and Ukraine bears some responsibility for part of that\", he tells the BBC. \n\"But the underlying challenge has been that there has always been a Russian or Russian-backed military threat, and that informs things.\"\nJohn Herbst, a former US ambassador to Kyiv who now works for the Washington-based think-tank Atlantic Council, argues that Russia, not Ukraine was the \"serial violator\" of the Minsk ceasefire accords, the first and still one of the most comprehensive attempts to broker a truce in Ukraine.\nVerifying claims of ceasefire violations is not easy because almost all independent journalists are banned from Russian-controlled parts of Ukraine.\nBBC journalist Olga Ivshina, who was on the ground in Ukraine's eastern Donbas region reporting about the earlier stages of the war, says there were reports of Ukraine retaking villages in 2016-19, a successful Ukrainian offensive outside Mariupol, and Ukrainian tanks were spotted too close to the frontline, where they should not have been under the ceasefire deals.\n\"All of these were proclaimed as violations by Moscow. But of course they forgot to mention that their capture of Debaltseve in 2015 was the biggest violation of all,\" Ivshina says. \nDespite the Minsk accords, Russian-controlled forces launched an offensive against the town of Debaltseve, claiming that it was not covered by the ceasefire deal.\nZelensky has described the Minsk accords as a \"trap\" for Ukraine which allowed Russia to prepare for the full-scale invasion. \nPutin says neither Ukraine nor its Western backers had intended to implement the Minsk deals. Their fate was sealed when Russia declared the so-called Donetsk and Luhansk \"people's republics\" - separatist entities it had helped to set up - as independent states.\nPutin's \"Easter truce\" was never more than a lull, but President Trump said \"hopefully Russia and Ukraine will make a deal this week\".\nSo far there has been no indication that the Kremlin will accept the US call for an immediate and unconditional ceasefire, agreed to by Ukraine. \nTrump has already warned that if either party makes ceasefire talks difficult, \"we're just gonna take a pass\" and walk away.\nRussia's demand for \"the underlying causes of the conflict\" to be resolved suggest it has not moved from its original objective of undermining Ukraine's sovereignty - through negotiations as well as military means.\nVladislav Surkov, a former close adviser to Vladimir Putin who was known as the \"grey cardinal\" of Russian politics, celebrates the Minsk accords last year as a way of \"legitimising\" Ukraine's initial partition.\nThe very idea of peace, he said, wass \"nothing but a continuation of war by other means\".\nRussian military authorities say the blast in a warehouse is due to a fire.\nMoscow launched strikes across Ukrainian cities hours after Putin said he was considering a pause on civilian targets.\nTwo plays by Ukrainian writers are set to have their world premiere during the festival.\nThe out-of-service ambulances are being used to provide care for those in warzones or civilians injured.\nRussia hoped to overthrow Ukraine's pro-Western government in days, but it failed.\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

As expected, the new production node will offer substantial benefits across power, performance, and area (PPA) metrics, thus providing tangible advantages both for client and data center products.\nIntel claims that its 18A fabrication process delivers 25% more performance at the same voltage (1.1V) and complexity, as well as 36% lower power at the same frequency and voltage of 1.1V for a standard Arm core sub-block compared to the same block fabricated on Intel 3 process technology. At a lower voltage (0.75V), Intel 18A provides 18% higher performance and 38% lower power. In addition, 18A consistently achieves 0.72X area scaling compared to Intel 3.\nIntel's 18A manufacturing technology is the company's first node to rely on gate-all-around (GAA) RibbonFET transistors and feature PowerVia backside power delivery network (BSPDN), two features that enable major PPA advantages.\nThe standard cell layout comparison highlights the significant physical scaling achieved by Intel 18A over Intel 3 in both High-Performance (HP) and High-Density (HD) libraries. Intel 18A reduces cell heights from 240CH to 180CH in HP libraries and from 210CH to 160CH in HD libraries, which represents a ~25% reduction in vertical dimension. This tighter cell architecture allows for increased transistor density, contributing directly to improved area efficiency.\nThe use of PowerVia BSPDN enables more efficient vertical routing by offloading power lines from the front side of ICs, freeing up space for signal routing and further compacting the layout. Additionally, refined gate, source/drain, and contact structures improve overall cell uniformity and integration density. These enhancements collectively enable Intel 18A to deliver better performance-per-area and energy efficiency, supporting more advanced and compact chip designs.\nIntel is reportedly on track to start high-volume manufacturing of compute chiplets for its codenamed Panther Lake processors for client PCs later this year and then chiplets for Clearwater Forest data center systems in early 2026. In addition, the company is on track to tape out the first third-party designs on 18A in mid-2025.\nApparently, there is interest in developing third-party chips for Intel 18A. In addition to presenting a general paper describing its 18A technology, Intel plans to present a paper describing a PAM-4 transmitter implemented using 18A production node with a BSPDN that is co-authored by engineers from Intel, Alphawave Semi (a contract chip designer and IP provider), Apple, and Nvidia. This does not necessarily mean that Apple or Nvidia will use Intel's 18A for production silicon, but this at least means that they are interested in checking it out.\nSpeaking of Apple and Nvidia, TSMC said that virtually all of its partners plan to adopt its N2 (2nm-class) process technology, so it is reasonable to expect this node to be more widely used than Intel's 18A. Nonetheless, for Intel it is crucial to show that it can develop a competitive node and ramp it to high volume, so 18A will play a vital role for the future of Intel's foundry business.\nAudio\nComputing\nGaming\nPhones\nScience\nHome Entertainment\nStreaming\nVPN\nWearables\nDeals\nAdvertise\nAbout our ads\nCareers\nHelp\nFeedback\nFollow us on\n(c) 2025 Yahoo.

When it is, it could make electric cars more competitive in price and performance with gasoline-powered models.\nU.S.-traded shares of CATL rose 2.6% Monday morning on the news.\nCATL produces one-third of the world's electric batteries, The Times reports. It supplies 16 of the world's biggest automakers, including Tesla (TSLA) and General Motors (GM).\nThe new CATL battery system, which the company touted during a news conference on Monday ahead of the Shanghai auto show, uses auxiliary batteries located in the car's underbody instead of one large battery, which is what most EVs use. That battery uses less graphite, which is a major driver of car batteries' high costs. Currently, batteries make up about one-third of the cost of electric vehicles.\nOuyang Chuying, CATL's co-president for research and development, said the new battery technology would be available in two to three years and possibly sooner, according to the Times. He wouldn't elaborate on which carmakers might be the first to use them.\nChinese manufacturer BYD (BYDDF), arguably CATL's biggest rival and a key Tesla rival in China, in March unveiled a new charging system that can give cars 292 miles (470 kilometers) of range in five minutes. The company announced at the time that it planned to set up 4,000 charging stations, although he didn't specify a timeline for doing so.

      "content": "Manage your account \n When JFK declared we're going to the moon, there was no agreed-upon plan. Sure, very smart engineers at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory had probably thought about it, maybe even penciled a calculation or two on the back of a napkin, but the presidential declaration made the need for a viable plan very real. There were many proposals and ultimately the concept that won--and got Apollo 11 to and from the moon--focused on extreme svelteness. The lunar program relied on saving every possible gram it could because the math of such a galactic undertaking, literally, is that adding weight requires more fuel, which itself increases weight. It's a case of diminishing returns, ergo lightness won.\nThe BMW M5 has not followed a similar path, though it is unfair to single out this one model, or even BMW. Every car company has made larger and heavier models over the last 30 years. But as BMWs grew, the brand introduced smaller cars--with a numerically smaller name, in some cases--to fill the vacated spot. While arguably more capable than ever, do not hate the new plug-in hybrid M5 because it weighs almost exactly as much as a 2019 BMW X5 xDrive50i or more than a 2024 Mercedes-AMG GLE53. Do not hate it because it is dimensionally larger than a 1996 BMW 740i. It may wear the same badge, but it will never do what an E39 M5 can do, in part because it weighs 1275 pounds more. (That would be 5251 pounds, which represents a 139-pound deduction from BMW's published curb weight, so that was a nice surprise. That said, the carbon-ceramic brakes and carbon-fiber roof are the lightest way to spec an M5.) Much like the M3, when it lost the V-8, don't hate the M5 for what it isn't. Love it for what it is.\nThe G90 M5 is a luxury sedan with a Saturn V rocket under the hood. Its twin-turbo 4.4-liter V-8 makes 577 horsepower. Its electric motor, capable of driving the car on its own for up to 25 miles per the EPA, makes 194 horses, and they combine to make a plug-in powerplant pumping out 717 horsepower: more than twice the power of the early 1990s E34 M5. The car is capable of accelerating to 60 mph in 3.0 seconds. It can hang on the skidpad at 0.98 g. It can stop from 100 mph in less than a football field. It's also one of the fastest cars from corner to corner in a canyon and more comfortable than Grandpa's favorite chair in city traffic. Unfortunately, this M5 isn't quicker than the last F90-generation M5 CS. That one burned a quarter-mile in 10.6 seconds, three-tenths quicker than this one. Nor is it quicker than the previous generation's base model. But we suspect BMW has the ability to turn up the wick on this hybrid, and more variants are on the way.\nSo what if it's a bit of a numbers car? When the M5 is not at the limit, adaptive dampers relax the ride to luxury levels. Its seats are huge thrones with umpteen-way controls. Massagers? You betcha. If you can't get comfortable in this front seat, we'll bet you're the type that inspired White Lotus writers when creating Parker Posey's character. BMW could have called this an M7, and no one would question it. Plus, this M5's back seat is downright huge.\nAs with the 2018 F90 M5, this one has stretched rear fenders. The 2.8 inches in additional width over a stock 5er does not do the M5 a lot of livability favors in city traffic. You sit so deep in the cockpit that the corners feel a zip code away. Pick up a friend and forget leaning over the center console to nudge the passenger door ajar, because the door's practically out of reach. The car is, of course, equipped with all kinds of sensors and cameras to help you with parking and maneuvering in a lot.\nThe steering feel is a little numb, but then again we drove the M5 back to back with a Cadillac CT5-V Blackwing. But as we said, this car is fast on the road. With all-wheel drive, clawing out of a corner on 285- and 295-section width Hankook Ventus S1 Evo Z tires (front and rear, respectively), grip is in abundance. And its chassis balance is good--not just good for a car that weighs this much, but good period. The brake feel and sensitivity from the $8500 carbon-ceramic stoppers makes for confident trail braking into corners. The faster you go, the smaller it feels.\nWe still aren't coming around to the latest BMW infotainment interface. BMW likes to make its customers the guinea pigs for new user interfaces, after all--remember, it pioneered a single control wheel with iDrive a couple decades back. Media hacks took to it like a cat takes to water. But this endless app-screen menu that is today's interface is very difficult to digest while in motion. It's almost like it was designed in a lab and never tested in a car.\nWhich brings us to the cost of this ride. The new M5, including its destination and gas-guzzler tax, starts at $123,275. When adjusted for inflation, that's less than the 2000 M5 and the 1991 M5 cost when new. So in one sense it is a huge bargain, but then there is the current market of uber-sedans, which include the more affordable Cadillac CT5-V Blackwing and the Audi RS7 (a hatchback, but so what). Only the M5 is a plug-in hybrid in that group, which is a meaningful distinction. For us, however, a manual-transmission Blackwing is way more desirable even if it is slower in a straight line. Our hope is that BMW recognizes the challenge of diminishing returns in the sedan arms race, and soon there will be a BMW M5 that once again takes us to the moon. \nYou Might Also Like\nCar and Driver's 10 Best Cars through the Decades\nHow to Buy or Lease a New Car\nLightning Lap Legends: Chevrolet Camaro vs. Ford Mustang!\nCar accessories\nAdvertise\nAbout our ads\nCareers\nHelp\nFollow us on\n(c) 2025 Yahoo.

      "content": "Vladimir Putin signalled he was open to talks with Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky for the first time since the early stages of the war, but Russian strikes continued hours after his comments.\nSpeaking to Russian state TV on Monday, Putin said Russia had \"always looked positively on any peace initiatives. We hope that representatives of the Kyiv regime will feel the same way\".\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Putin's comments indicated a willingness to engage in direct talks with Ukraine about not striking civilian targets. \nHowever, Russian attacks on Ukrainian cities continued on Tuesday with a wave of strikes across the country. \nA strike on an apartment block in Zaporizhzhia killed one woman and injured 20 others, including four children.\nIn Kharkiv in the country's east, authorities said a massive drone attack on Tuesday during the daytime injured at least seven people.\nPresident Zelensky said on Tuesday afternoon there had also been strikes on Odesa, Sumy, Donetsk and other southern regions, while Ukrainian media also reported a strike in south-east Kherson.\nThe Monday night strike on Odesa had targeted a five-storey unit block and injured three people, local media reported.\nPresident Zelensky described the wave of attacks as \"deliberate Russian terror\" which could be \"stopped by a single order\". \nThis had been proven by the short-lived Easter truce on Saturday, \"when there were no airstrikes in Ukraine\", he wrote on Telegram.\nHe again reiterated that Ukraine had proposed to extend that truce. He also again raised his proposal, voiced on Sunday, for a 30-day period for a cease to \"any strikes using long-range drones and missiles on civilian infrastructure for a period of at least 30 days\". \nPutin's remarks on Monday evening were believed to be in response to this proposal.\nThere have been no direct talks between Russia and Ukraine since the initial weeks after the former launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.\n\"When the president said that it was possible to discuss the issue of not striking civilian targets, including bilaterally, the president had in mind negotiations and discussions with the Ukrainian side,\" Peskov told the Interfax news agency, clarifying Putin's remarks. \nZelensky, in his nightly video address, on Monday said Ukraine needed a \"clear answer from Moscow\" on whether it would agree to stop attacks on civilian infrastructure.\nReferring to the short-lived and limited truce declared by Putin over Easter, the Ukrainian leader proposed a follow-up that would \"cease any strikes using long-range drones and missiles on civilian infrastructure for a period of at least 30 days\". \n\"If Russia does not agree to such a step, it will be proof that it wants to continue doing only things that destroy people's lives and continue the war,\" he said.\nPutin said the Kremlin would \"analyse\" the idea, telling journalists that \"as for the proposal not to strike at civilian infrastructure facilities... this needs to be sorted out\".\nIn a rare admission, he acknowledged that the military had targeted a civilian building when Russian missiles killed 35 people and wounded more than 100 others in the centre of the north-eastern city of Sumy earlier this month.\nThis was the worst Russian attack on civilians in Ukraine this year. \n\"Everyone is well aware of the strike by our Armed Forces on a congress centre, I think, in Sumy Region. Is it a civilian facility or not?

Ukrainian President Zelensky proposed a 30-day ceasefire to cease attacks on civilian infrastructure using long-range drones and missiles. He also highlighted the need for Russia to respond positively to this proposal.  While Putin acknowledged a military strike in Sumy that killed civilians, he did not explicitly address the ceasefire proposal.

It was presented to the US by the Russian government.\nAnother sculpture, Good Defeats Evil, sits at the UN Headquarters in New York. It depicts St George slaying a dragon, which lies among broken fragments of US and Soviet missiles.\nThe work represents \"the vanquishing of nuclear war through the historic treaty between the Soviet Union and the United States\", according to the UN website.\nIn 2006, Tsereteli caused controversy in a small French town, which erected his huge 8.75m-tall (29 ft) bronze statue of Pope John Paul II. Opponents said the statue violated France's secularity laws.\nAt 110m (360ft), Tsereteli's colossal monument to Christopher Columbus's first voyage, Birth of the New World, is one of the tallest sculptures on earth. It was eventually constructed in Puerto Rico, after several US cities rejected it.\nHe also made smaller bronze studies of major figures including Princess Diana and Putin.\nTsereteli was also a painter - notably of flowers - and an architect who took a key role in reconstructing Moscow's Cathedral of Christ the Saviour.\nRussian military authorities say the blast in a warehouse is due to a fire.\nA Right Royal Heist exhibition will open at Lincoln Cathedral on 3 May. \nBeyonce's mum says she's concerned about her grandchildren reading 'lies' put out about them.\nArtist Farrah Fortnam said she wants to raise the issue of rewilding and inspire \"hope and joy\".\nMore than 65 seaside images are set to be displayed across the East Sussex city. \nCopyright 2025 BBC.

Since then, Delhi and Washington have been working towards an early conclusion of trade negotiations.\nIn his speech in Jaipur, Vance said that the two countries had finalised the terms of reference for the negotiation.\n\"This is a vital step toward realising President Trump and Prime Minister Modi's vision because it sets a roadmap toward a final deal between our nations,\" Vance said.\nHe also called Modi a \"tough negotiator\" and someone \"who drives a hard bargain\", drawing applause from the audience.\nModi and Trump share a warm personal relationship: the Indian prime minister was among the first global leaders to visit Trump after his second term began. But the US president has repeatedly taken aim at India's high tariffs, branding it a \"tariff king\" and a \"big abuser\" of trade ties.\nEven in the statement issued on Monday after Vance's meeting with Modi, US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer highlighted the \"serious lack of reciprocity in the trade relationship with India\".\nIndia has already cut tariffs on a number of goods in the past few months and is reportedly considering more wide-ranging cuts to pacify Trump. But sectors like agriculture - where Washington wants greater access, but India fiercely protects - are still sticking points. \nVance also said in Jaipur that the US is seeking to sell more energy and defence equipment to Delhi. On Monday, in addition to trade, the two leaders had also discussed cooperation in defence, strategic technologies and energy.\nThe Indian prime minister also said after the meeting that he was looking forward to welcoming Trump to India this year. Delhi is hosting the Quad summit later this year and the US president is expected to attend it.\nThe bilateral meeting was followed by delegation-level talks and a dinner hosted by Modi for Vance and his family. \nVance arrived in India on Monday morning, accompanied by his wife Usha and their three children. Usha Vance's parents migrated to the US from the southern state of Andhra Pradesh, and some media reports have said that Vance and his wife are keen to introduce their children to their Indian heritage.\nPhotographs of the three children wearing Indian-style outfits - the two boys in kurta-pyjamas and three-year-old Mirabel wearing a lehenga - on their arrival in India were splashed across Indian newspapers and websites.\nThe rest of Vance's visit is largely personal. After the meeting with Modi, the family visited Jaipur city, where they visited the historic Amer Fort on Tuesday. \nThe family is also set to visit the iconic Taj Mahal in Agra city on Wednesday before flying to the US the next day.\nFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, X and Facebook.\nJames Morgan boasted about his homemade weapons online, and also posted violent racist, anti-police and anti-government messages.\nThe cuts involve some 130 of the more than 700 agency offices within the State Department. \nOfficials said there were no injuries reported but that high levels of carbon monoxide were discovered in nearby buildings.\nThe region's chief minister said the attack was \"much larger than anything we've seen directed at civilians in recent years\".\nThe US suffers the biggest downgrade to growth among advanced economies, in the influential International Monetary Fund's latest forecast.\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

      "summary": "The mission will explore new ways of reducing the cost of feeding an astronaut.",
      "content": "Steak, mashed potatoes and desserts for astronauts could soon be grown from individual cells in space if an experiment launched into orbit today is successful.\nA European Space Agency (ESA) project is assessing the viability of growing so-called lab-grown food in the low gravity and higher radiation in orbit and on other worlds.\nESA is funding the research to explore new ways of reducing the cost of feeding an astronaut, which can cost up to PS20,000 per day.\nThe team involved say the experiment is a first step to developing a small pilot food production plant on the International Space Station in two years' time.\nLab-grown food will be essential if Nasa's objective of making humanity a multi-planetary species were to be realised, claims Dr Aqeel Shamsul, CEO and founder of Bedford-based Frontier Space, which is developing the concept with researchers at Imperial College, London.\n\"Our dream is to have factories in orbit and on the Moon,\" he told BBC News.\n\"We need to build manufacturing facilities off world if we are to provide the infrastructure to enable humans to live and work in space\".\nLab-grown food involves growing food ingredients, such as protein, fat and carbohydrates in test tubes and vats and then processing them to make them look and taste like normal food.\nLab-grown chicken is already on sale in the US and Singapore and lab grown steak is awaiting approval in the UK and Israel. On Earth, there are claimed environmental benefits for the technology over traditional agricultural food production methods, such as less land use and reduced greenhouse gas emissions. But in space the primary driver is to reduce costs.\nThe researchers are doing the experiment because it costs so much to send astronauts food on the ISS - up to PS20,000 per astronaut per day, they estimate. \nNasa, other space agencies and private sector firms plan to have a long-term presence on the Moon, in orbiting space stations and maybe one day on Mars. That will mean sending up food for tens and eventually hundreds of astronauts living and working in space - something that would be prohibitively expensive if it were sent up by rockets, according to Dr Shamsul.\nGrowing food in space would make much more sense, he suggests.\n\"We could start off simply with protein-enhanced mashed potatoes on to more complex foods which we could put together in space,\" he tells me.\n\"But in the longer term we could put the lab-grown ingredients into a 3D printer and print off whatever you want on the space station, such as a steak!\"\nThis sounds like the replicator machines on Star Trek, which are able to produce food and drink from pure energy. But it is no longer the stuff of science fiction, says Dr Shamsul.\nHe showed me a set-up, called a bioreactor, at Imperial College's Bezos Centre for Sustainable Proteins in west London. It comprised a brick-coloured concoction bubbling away in a test tube. The process is known as precision fermentation, which is like the fermentation used to make beer, but different: \"precision\" is a rebranding word for genetically engineered.\nIn this case a gene has been added to yeast to produce extra vitamins, but all sorts of ingredients can be produced in this way, according to Dr Rodrigo Ledesma-Amaro, Director of the Bezos Centre.\n\"We can make all the elements to make food,\" says Dr Ledesma-Amaro proudly.\n\"We can make proteins, fats, carbohydrates, fibres and they can be combined to make different dishes.\"\nA much smaller, simpler version of the biorector has been sent into space on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket as part of the ESA mission. There is plenty of evidence that foods can be successfully grown from cells on Earth, but can the process be repeated in the weightlessness and higher radiation of space?\nDrs Ledesma-Amaro and Shamsul have sent small amounts of the yeast concoction to orbit the Earth in a small cube satellite on board Europe's first commercial returnable spacecraft, Phoenix. If all goes to plan, it will orbit the Earth for around three hours before falling back to Earth off the coast of Portugal. The experiment will be retrieved by a recovery vessel and sent back to the lab in London to be examined.\nThe data they gather will inform the construction of a larger, better bioreactor which the scientists will send into space next year, according to Dr Ledesma-Amaro.\nThe problem, though, is that the brick-coloured goo, which is dried into a powder, looks distinctly unappetising - even less appetising than the freeze-dried fare that astronauts currently have to put up with.\nThat is where Imperial College's master chef comes in. Jakub Radzikowski is the culinary education designer tasked with turning chemistry into cuisine.\nHe isn't allowed to use lab grown ingredients to make dishes for people just yet, because regulatory approval is still pending. But he's getting a head start. For now, instead of lab-grown ingredients, Jakub is using starches and proteins from naturally occurring fungi to develop his recipes. He tells me all sorts of dishes will be possible, once he gets the go-ahead to use lab-grown ingredients.\n\"We want to create food that is familiar to astronauts who are from different parts of the world so that it can provide comfort.\n\"We can create anything from French, Chinese, Indian. It will be possible to replicate any kind of cuisine in space.\"\nToday, Jakub is trying out a new recipe of spicy dumplings and dipping sauce. He tells me that I am allowed to try them out, but taster-in-chief is someone far more qualified: Helen Sharman, the UK's first astronaut, who also has a PhD in chemistry.\nWe tasted the steaming dumplings together. \nMy view: \"They are absolutely gorgeous!\"\nDr Sharman's expert view, not dissimilar: \"You get a really strong blast from the flavour.

Albert J. Estrada was a member of Battery B, 57th Field Artillery Battalion, 31st Regimental Combat Team, 7th Infantry Division, the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency said in a news release. He began service in July 1950, according to the Korean War Veterans Memorial Foundation. He was one of tens of thousands of soldiers present at the Battle of Chosin Reservoir in November and December 1950, the DPAA said. \nDuring the battle, 30,000 United Nations servicemembers, including U.S. soldiers, faced off against 120,000 Chinese and North Korean enemy forces in \"rugged terrain in lethally cold weather,\" the DPAA said. The battle, which the DPAA described as \"one of the most brutal\" of the entire war, raged for 17 days. \nArmy officials wanted to push North Korean forces into China and sever supply lines near the Chosin reservoir, the DPAA said. But the North Korean forces launched a surprise attack that forced one group of soldiers to retreat in late November. A few days later, Chinese soldiers surrounded and isolated another group of soldiers. A task force was hastily assembled to try to organize a withdrawal. A \"bitter fight\" allowed U.N. forces to open an airfield to bring in reinforcements and evacuate casualties on December 1, according to the U.S. military, and eventually, the U.N. soldiers managed a full retreat. \nMore than 1,000 U.S. Marines and soldiers were killed during this time, the DPAA said. Thousands more were injured or incapacitated by the cold weather. Due to the elements and the retreat, \"hundreds of fallen Marines and soldiers were unable to be immediately recovered,\" the DPAA said. \nEstrada was one of the soldiers who could not be located after the battle. He was reported missing on Dec. 6, 1950. There was no information to indicate that he was ever held as a prisoner of war, the DPAA said. Three years later, on Dec. 31, 1953, the U.S. Army issued a presumptive finding of death. \nBetween 1953 and 1954, the North Korean government returned thousands of remains of soldiers who had died during the Korean War. The remains had been buried in U.N. cemeteries in North Korea. The effort, known as Operation Glory, included the return of 500 sets of remains that had been buried near the Chosin reservoir. All but 126 of the remains were identified. The unidentified remains were buried as unknowns at the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific, the DPAA said. \nFrom 1990 to 1994, the North Korean government returned 47 additional containers of remains attributed to the Battle of Chosin Reservoir. From those recovery efforts, the DPAA and the organizations that preceded it were able to identify over 130 of the unaccounted-for missing personnel lost in the Chosin Reservoir Campaign. \nThe DPAA did not say which handover Estrada's remains were recovered from. A full announcement of his accounting will be shared at a later date, the agency said. \nEstrada earned multiple military honors, including the Purple Heart, the National Defense Service Medal, and the Republic of Korea War Service Medal, according to the Korean War Veterans Memorial Foundation. \nEstrada's surviving siblings, Manuel Estrada and Ruth Tucker, have long lobbied for his identification, according to a 2018 article from The Daily Democrat. That year, Tucker was presented with a medal from the Republic of South Korea honoring her efforts to account for missing American soldiers who died during the Korean War. At the time, Tucker said complete identification of Korean War remains can take between four and five years. \nKerry Breen is a news editor at CBSNews.com.

It was originally scheduled to happen on April 27, the second Sunday of Easter.\nAcutis died of leukemia in 2006 at the age of 15. Born in London to wealthy Italian parents, he grew up in Milan, where he managed the website for his parish and later a Vatican-based academy. He also used his computer skills to create an online database of Eucharistic miracles around the world.\nHis road to sainthood started more than 10 years ago at the initiative of a group of priests and friends, and formally took off shortly after Francis began his papacy in 2013.\nAcutis was named \"venerable\" in 2018 after the church recognized his virtuous life, and his body - wearing sneakers, jeans and a sweatshirt - was taken to a shrine in the Santuario della Spogliazione in Assisi, Italy.

      "ml_hf_summary": "The canonization of Carlo Acutis, an Italian teenager who was set to become the first millennial saint, has been postponed for at least one week following the death of Pope Francis on April 20, 2025. The original date was scheduled for April 27th, but will now take place next Sunday in St. Peter's Square during the Jubilee celebration of adolescents. Acutis died of leukemia at age 15 in 2006 and his path to sainthood began over a decade ago after he was recognized as \"venerable\" in 2018.  He was declared \"blessed\" or beatified in 2020 following the attribution of one miracle, a Brazilian child's healing from a congenital disease affecting their pancreas. A second miracle attributed to Acutis occurred in May 2024 involving a university student in Florence who recovered from a brain bleed after a bicycle accident.

      "content": "Watch CBS News \n Updated on: April 21, 2025 / 7:49 AM EDT\n / CBS/AFP \n A Vietnamese property tycoon who was jailed for life in a $17 billion money laundering case had her sentence cut to 30 years on appeal on Monday after she claimed what happened was \"an accident.\"\nProperty developer Truong My Lan had already lost a challenge against the death penalty in a separate case in which she was found guilty in April last year of stealing money from Saigon Commercial Bank (SCB) and fraud amounting to $27 billion.\nThe appeal court ruled there was no basis to reduce her sentence but said she could still escape the death penalty if she returned three-quarters of the stolen assets. That means she could still avoid execution if she returns $9 billion, or three-quarters of the $12 billion she embezzled, the BBC reported.\nFour months later, an appeal court in Ho Chi Minh City ruled on Monday that a life sentence she was handed for three crimes during a second trial in October would be reduced to 30 years.\n\"Lan played the major role... (but) we also take into consideration the amount of money that Lan has spent on overcoming the consequences,\" judge Pham Cong Muoi said following discussions during the appeal about how her assets may be used to compensate victims of her crimes.\nProsecutors said she had repaid a quarter of the $1.2 billion she defrauded from thousands of bond investors.\n\"The total value of her holdings actually exceeds the required compensation amount,\" lawyer Nguyen Huy Thiep told the BBC before her appeal was rejected. \"However, these require time and effort to sell, as many of the assets are real estate and take time to liquidate. Truong My Lan hopes the court can create the most favorable conditions for her to continue making compensation.\"\nLan's husband Chu Lap Co did not appeal, but the judging panel concluded that his two-year sentence should be cut by half after he paid back the $1.2 million he was found to have laundered.\nIn her final words before the court last week, Lan described what happened as \"an accident.\"\n\"Since being jailed, I have tried my best... to seek the best solutions to (deal with my) projects and properties,\" she was quoted as saying by state media.\n\"Please acknowledge my effort,\" she added.\nThe 68-year-old was found guilty in October of laundering $17.7 billion and illegal cross-border trafficking of $4.5 billion.\nShe was also found guilty of bond fraud.\nThe court determined during the trial that Lan was \"the mastermind, committed the crime with sophisticated methods, many times, causing especially serious consequences.\"\nDuring her first trial in April 2024, Lan was found guilty of embezzling $12.5 billion but prosecutors said the damages caused by the scam totaled $27 billion -- equivalent to around 6% of Vietnam's 2023 GDP.\nLan owned just 5% of shares in SCB on paper but the court concluded that she effectively controlled more than 90% through family, friends and staff.\nTens of thousands of people who had invested their savings in the bank lost money, prompting rare protests in the communist nation.\nDuring her trial, Lan was sometimes defiant, but in the recent hearings for her appeal against the sentence she was more contrite, the BBC reported. She said she was ashamed to have been such a drain on the state, and that her only thought was to pay back what she had taken.\n\"I feel pained due to the waste of national resources,\" Lan said in November, adding she felt \"very embarrassed to be charged with this crime.\" \n (c) 2025 CBS Interactive Inc.
