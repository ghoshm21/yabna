The competition is demanding and it's never been more demanding. The GPS data is through the roof this year.\n\"So I've got to say I just don't understand that. I think it's something that needs to be looked at.\n\"We had 20 minutes on the field this entire week, so it's difficult. I've seen other teams with it as well, so it's not just us, it's across the competition and needs to be looked at.\n\"In the AFL they don't have less than six-day turnarounds.\"\nThe latest setback for Croker is a mighty blow for Manly, who have lacked the hooker's guile and control out of dummy half.\n\"Crokes had a clean out on his knee during the week, so he'll be about a month,\" Seibold said.\n\"It's unfortunate because he's a really valuable member of the squad and we've missed him.\"\nSign up for our emails\nFind out More\n(c) West Australian Newspapers Limited 2025",
      "ml_hf_summary": "Manly Sea Eagles coach Anthony Seibold criticized the NRL's scheduling, citing their recent heavy travel schedule as a contributing factor to injuries and performance issues.  The team played three games in 11 days, including trips to Melbourne, Cronulla, and St George Illawarra, leading to key players like Nathan Brown, Jake Trbojevic, and Tommy Talau suffering injuries. Seibold highlighted the demanding travel schedule as a concern for player welfare, comparing it to other sports with less frequent turnarounds.  He also noted that rivals such as Canberra have faced similar challenges with their recent travel commitments.  Hooker Lachlan Croker is expected to be out for a month after undergoing knee surgery, further impacting Manly's roster. \n"

      "content": "Olaf Storbeck in Frankfurt and Ian Smith in London\nPublishedApril 17 2025\nUpdatedApril 17 2025\nYour guide to what the 2024 US election means for Washington and the world\nThe European Central Bank has cut its benchmark interest rate by a quarter-point to 2.25 per cent as it prepares for the economic fallout from the trade war ignited by US President Donald Trump.\nThursday's unanimous decision by the ECB's rate-setters, which brings borrowing costs in the currency bloc to their lowest in more than two years, had been widely expected after Trump's announcement of sweeping tariffs on most of the US's trading partners on April 2. \n\"The outlook for growth has deteriorated owing to rising trade tensions,\" the ECB said, adding that \"the adverse and volatile market response\" to the tariffs was likely to have a \"tightening impact on financing conditions\" for businesses and consumers.\nECB president Christine Lagarde highlighted the \"exceptional uncertainty\" confronting the economy, while maintaining that inflation was on track to come down to the bank's 2 per cent target.\n\"Euro-area exporters face new barriers to trade, although their scope remains unclear,\" she said, adding that \"disruption to international commerce, financial market tensions and geopolitical uncertainty are weighing on business investment\".\nSome content could not load. Check your internet connection or browser settings.\nAnalysts and asset managers at institutions including Fidelity and Morgan Stanley said the meeting was relatively dovish. \nWhile the ECB said last month that monetary policy had already become \"less restrictive\", it dropped the reference from Thursday's statement, with Lagarde describing it as \"meaningless at this point in time\".\nThe ECB's cut this week is the seventh reduction since it started cutting its deposit rate last June.\n\"Make no mistake, this marks a dovish shift by the ECB,\" Claus Vistesen, chief Eurozone economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, wrotein a note to clients.\nAhead of the decision, Trump compared the ECB's rate-cutting record with the US Federal Reserve, which kept rates on hold at its last meeting in March. \nECB president Christine Lagarde speaking \nThe US president said Fed chair Jay Powell, who warned on Wednesday of the tariffs' impact on US growth and inflation, was \"always TOO LATE AND WRONG\" and his \"termination cannot come fast enough!\"\nAsked about those comments, Lagarde said she \"had a lot of respect for Powell, whom she described as \"my esteemed colleague and friend\" and stressed the \"fundamental\" principle of ECB independence.\nTraders stuck to their bets of at least two more quarter-point cuts by the end of this year, and pushed up the chance of a third cut to around 60 per cent, according to levels implied by swaps markets.\n\"The acknowledgment of slowing inflation, while highlighting risks to real activity are a strong signal [of further cuts],\" said Tomasz Wieladek, chief European economist at asset manager T Rowe Price.\nGerman Bunds rallied, with the yield on rate-sensitive two-year bonds, which moves inversely to price, down 0.06 percentage points on the day at 1.68 per cent. The euro was little changed against the dollar at $1.136.\nLagarde said that, while the ECB knew the US tariffs were \"a negative demand shock\" with \"some impact on growth\", the impact on inflation would only become clearer over the course of time.\nOn the one hand, she said, lower energy prices, a stronger euro and increased imports from China could drive inflation down. But, she added, fragmenting supply chains could also increase upward pressure on prices, as could higher government spending on defence and infrastructure.\nTrump performed a partial U-turn last week, delaying his full \"reciprocal tariffs\" of 20 per cent on EU goods for 90 days, during which time a rate of 10 per cent will apply. But top central bankers say his protectionist policies are still likely to be a negative economic shock for the Euro area.\nThe ECB was already confronting slower growth and cooling price pressures. In March, the central bank cut its 2025 growth forecast for the Eurozone to 0.9 per cent -- its sixth consecutive reduction.\nInflation edged down last month to 2.2 per cent as service prices rose at their slowest pace for almost three years.\nEconomists say inflation could be driven further down by this month's oil price fall, the recent rise in the euro against the dollar, and a potential surge in Chinese imports to the Eurozone. All three developments are widely seen as consequences of Trump's trade policy, at least in part. \nBut the increase in debt-funded spending in Germany and elsewhere in the Eurozone could prove an inflationary pressure.",
      "ml_hf_summary": "The European Central Bank (ECB) lowered its benchmark interest rate by a quarter-point to 2.25% on April 17, 2025, citing the economic fallout from US President Donald Trump's trade war tariffs. This decision was unanimous and follows Trump's announcement of sweeping tariffs on most trading partners. The ECB anticipates a tightening impact on financing conditions for businesses and consumers due to market volatility caused by these tariffs.  The move is part of a series of rate cuts since June 2023, reflecting the bank's dovish stance in response to slowing growth and cooling inflation. Despite acknowledging the negative demand shock from the tariffs, the ECB expects inflation to decline further due to lower energy prices, a stronger euro, and increased imports from China.  The US Federal Reserve (Fed) maintained its interest rate at its last meeting in March. \n"

The 49-year-old, who is seeded fifth, defeated Carter in the 2008 and 2012 finals at the Crucible.\nO'Sullivan has not played competitively since snapping his cue after withdrawing from the Championship League in January. He pulled out of five of the last six World Snooker Tour events on medical grounds but confirmed on Thursday that he will play in this year's tournament.\n\"I'm proud to continue my record of having never missed a World Championship. I have many fond memories at the Crucible and look forward to making more in 2025. I've enjoyed some good prep with my new cue over the last week so feel good ahead of Tuesday,\" O'Sullivan told TNT Sports.\nO'Sullivan and Carter, who overcame a neck injury to qualify, have endured a rocky relationship and notably clashed after last year's Masters final. O'Sullivan said his opponent was \"not a nice person\" during an expletive-laden rant following his 10-7 victory in that match after Carter accused him of \"snotting all over the floor\".\nO'Sullivan has been an ever-present at the Crucible since turning professional in 1992. Widely regarded as the greatest player of all time, he is chasing a record eighth world title in the modern era to move clear of Stephen Hendry's achievements. His match against Carter is scheduled to start on Tuesday.\nSpeaking of the O'Sullivan-Carter match-up, four-time champion Mark Selby told BBC Radio 5 Live: \"I don't think either of them will be happy with that draw. Ronnie, it's great that he's in the competition, we've not seen him since January, so it's great. I want him to play and, as it stands at the moment, it seems like he is playing, which is fantastic for the game. Carter is probably one of the toughest qualifiers to get drawn against; he's played Ronnie in the world final, played in a Masters final, that's a horrible draw.\" Selby, who was in Salford to help conduct the draw on Thursday morning, is set to face fellow Leicester player Ben Woollaston.\nKyren Wilson begins his title defence against debutant Lei Peifan when action starts on Saturday morning, while world No 1 Judd Trump - the 2019 winner - has been paired with Zhou Yuelong. Masters champion Shaun Murphy will play debutant Daniel Wells, four-time winner John Higgins takes on Joe O'Connor and three-time champion Mark Williams faces 21-year-old Wu Yize.\nWith a record 10 Chinese players in the draw, 2016 finalist Ding Junhui will take on Crucible newcomer Zak Surety. Former UK champion Zhao Xintong, who is playing under amateur status after returning from a 20-month ban after an investigation into match-fixing, awaits last year's runner-up, Jak Jones.\nLuca Brecel, the 2023 champion, starts against Ryan Day, while the 2010 winner Neil Robertson takes on Chris Wakelin. In the other first-round matches, Mark Allen faces Fan Zhengyi, Barry Hawkins has been paired with Hossein Vafaei, David Gilbert plays Si Jiahui, Xiao Guodong takes on Matthew Selt and Zhang Anda plays his compatriot Pang Junxu.\nThe final takes place over two days, beginning on Sunday 4 May, with PS500,000 for the winner.",
      "ml_hf_summary": "Ronnie O'Sullivan, a seven-time world champion, will face Ali Carter in the first round of the 2023 World Snooker Championship.  O'Sullivan has not competed since January and was drawn to play Carter, his long-term rival, after recovering from medical issues. The match is scheduled for Tuesday. Other notable matches include Mark Selby facing Ben Woollaston, Kyren Wilson defending his title against Lei Peifan, and Judd Trump playing Zhou Yuelong.

Pre-tax profit jumped from PS277m to PS384m.\nMr Roberts declined to comment on what effect US President Donald Trump's tariffs could have on the business, which also owns Argos and the Habitat brand.\nThere has been speculation that China, faced with high tariffs on selling goods to the US, might re-route products to other countries and sell them cheaply to offload them. \nMr Roberts said that Sainsbury's was \"watching developments carefully\".\nWhile revenue at Sainsbury's grew strongly over the 12 months to 1 March, sales continued to fall at Argos although it said that the situation improved as it boosted traffic to the brand's website.\nThe supermarket also reported an 8.9% drop in fuel sales to PS4.7bn. It blamed \"reduced demand\" as well as the lower cost of petrol and diesel due to \"falling commodity prices in a highly competitive market\".\nOfficial data released on Wednesday showed that the falling cost of motor fuel helped drive down the overall rate of inflation.\nInflation eased by more than expected to 2.6% in the year to March, from 2.8% in February.\nEconomic uncertainty globally and in the UK means there are conflicting forces at play with prices.\nThe food bank in Darlington says it can no longer afford to pay four out of five of its staff.\nInflation falls in the year to March as the price of petrol drops.\nThe rate at which prices are rising remains above the Bank of England's 2% inflation target.\nThe number of job vacancies and people on payrolls fell ahead of changes to National Insurance and wages.\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

      "summary": "Sir Peter Mathieson says ministers must act over the future funding model for Scotland's universities.",
      "content": "A radical shift in the way Scottish higher education students are funded must be found by Holyrood politicians, according to the principal of Edinburgh University.\nSir Peter Mathieson said it is a \"tragedy\" that Dundee University faces the possibility of closure if it does not make major cuts, and it would also be a tragedy if others were to run into similar financial difficulties.\nSir Peter is facing anger from staff at the University of Edinburgh at plans to cut PS140m from its spending - equivalent to at least a month's expenditure each year.\nAnd in a wide-ranging interview with BBC Scotland, he said he cannot rule out compulsory redundancies at the 442-year-old institution.\nSir Peter said there will have to be a \"radical re-wiring\" of the way the university operates, with fewer courses and less organisational complexity and duplication.\n\"There are inefficiencies about the way we deliver things. This is a mammoth university with 22 schools and lots of duplication. We're very good at adding new things, not at taking things away,\" he said.\n\"We need to take a seriously look at the way we do things, and be responsible with the scale of operations we can afford to provide.\n\"So there's radical rewiring (needed) of the way we do our business, but also of political imperatives. \n\"If it's to be a political priority, then it has to be adequately funded to ensure its future.\"\nHe said student numbers are likely to remain at around 50,000 while the number of academic staff will fall from 15,000. But he declined to give a figure for the number expected to go.\nThe warning follows a sharp unplanned rise in the number and cost of staff over the last three years, which has not been matched by growth in income from overseas student fees.\nThe principal says there is no intention to close departments, and while some courses will close, existing students can be sure their current courses will be completed.\nSir Peter denied that nearly PS1bn of financial assets controlled by the university could be tapped to deal with the shortfall. \nAnd he warned recent budget surpluses of PS150m and PS400m cannot be sustained.\nHe also denied that the scale of the challenge is being exaggerated to push through reform, as staff unions have claimed.\nAcross Scotland, rapid growth has been funded through a sharp increase in the number of fee-paying overseas students. \nIn the last academic year, Edinburgh secured PS360m from overseas students, while the Scottish government paid PS27m in fees for Scotland-based students.\nA further PS82m came from the fees paid by students from other parts of the UK, which amounts to nearly PS28,000 for the standard four-year honours degree.\nUniversities in Scotland say that the Scottish contribution of around PS7500 per student per year is far below the cost of their education, and that international student fee income is proving an unreliable way to close the gap. \nIn the rest of the UK, fees are around PS2000 more.\nDundee University is having to shed as many as 700 staff in response to a severe financial crisis, which is partly the result of a sudden drop in the number of overseas student recruits. \nThe most recent one-year figure was a 27% drop, and it is reported to have fallen more sharply in the most recent intake.\nSir Peter said it is \"a tragedy\" that the interim principal on Tayside says closure or break up of the university there is a possible outcome of the crisis.\n\"It would be a tragedy for Scotland if other universities were to get themselves into a similar situation,\" he said. \"What we're doing here is to make sure we don't.\"\nOther universities are taking action to reduce costs as student recruitment falls short of growth expectations. On Thursday, the University of Aberdeen followed Dundee, Edinburgh and Robert Gordon universities in announcing multi-million pound cuts. \n The Edinburgh University principal laid down a challenge to Scotland's political parties to take urgent action on funding. \nHe said the funding shortfall in Scotland is worse than in England because of a tighter squeeze on fees per student, and because the number of recruits in Scotland is capped.\nAn independent assessment of Holyrood funding points to a drop of at least 22% in the real value of Scottish ministers' grants for higher education.\nSir Peter said ministers will either have to fund student tuition at a much higher level, or reduce the number of Scots going to university.\nOtherwise, with volatile fee income from foreign students, he believes other funds have to be allowed.\nHe suggested options of a graduate contribution, or allowing universities to recruit Scottish students who are able and willing to pay towards their fees. At present, they are barred from attending if they cannot get a government-funded place.\nThere's frustration among vice-chancellors that the future of Scottish education is always framed in terms of 'fee or free', and Sir Peter says he is \"not necessarily\" in favour of charging for tuition.\n\"We need more income into the system, either through some kind of means testing or a post-graduate system of earnings repayment.\n\"Either we have tuition fees which are adequate to pay the costs, or we have another mechanism to pay the costs. If we had a hybrid system, where some people pay fees and some people don't, one possibility is that that's means-tested in some way.\"\nResponding to Sir Peter's comments, the Scottish government's Higher Education Minister, Graeme Day, said:\n\"The sector is aware we are open to exploring the future funding model of universities, but we are clear that this government will not reintroduce tuition fees. \n\"Access to higher education must be based on the ability to learn, not the ability to pay.\n\"Broader financial pressures facing the sector remain, including the UK government's migration policies and its decision to raise employers' National Insurance contributions.\"\nSir Peter, who was raised by his mother after his father's early death, said he said he \"would not have gone to university if we had to pay fees\". \nHe also backed free tuition for students from lower income homes.\n\"Providing opportunities to people from less advantaged background is a very important priority for me,\" he added.\nPolice discovered quantities of cannabis in the Lothians, Edinburgh and East Ayrshire.\nThe university says the savings steps are \"regrettable but necessary\" as it seeks to stabilise finances.\nCulture convener Val Walker was described as a \"tireless campaigner\" by a former colleague.\nBrian Dowling, 21, who is from London, tried to hide the murder weapon in the grounds of Holyrood Palace.\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

      "ml_hf_summary": "Edinburgh University principal Sir Peter Mathieson has warned that Scottish higher education faces a financial crisis requiring significant reform, potentially leading to staff reductions and course closures.  He cites a sharp increase in staff costs without corresponding growth in income from overseas student fees as the primary cause of this shortfall. The university is planning to reduce spending by £140 million, which will likely result in job losses and fewer courses offered. Mathieson emphasizes the need for increased funding from the Scottish government or alternative mechanisms like means-tested tuition fees to ensure the long-term sustainability of higher education in Scotland.  He also highlights the challenges faced by other universities across Scotland, including Dundee University, which is facing potential closure due to a significant drop in overseas student recruitment. \n"

And to be told that all promotions are being frozen across the university when people are already overstretched, it's really difficult and demoralising.\"\nProf Clough warned that more redundancies could impact the student experience due to staff being \"even more overstretched\".\nHe said the union would work to find a solution with senior management, but it would consider \"all possible action\" if the university announced compulsory redundancies.\nThe University of Aberdeen's future was recently in \"significant doubt\" due to financial pressures, according to its annual report in May last year.\nUncertainties such as rising costs and falling numbers of international students were highlighted.\nIt described a \"material uncertainty that may cast significant doubt over the ability to continue as a going concern\".\nHowever, the university had said the report set out the potential risk if action was not taken, and that it was now on a firm financial footing.\nHigher Education Minister Graeme Dey said: \"This will be an anxious time for staff and students at the university, and students should be supported through this period and receive timely information about the impact of any disruption on their studies.\n\"While Aberdeen University is an autonomous institution, we would urge the university and trade unions to engage constructively to resolve disputes. \n\"Any decisions taken should be based on the principles of fair work, and compulsory redundancies considered only ever be used as a last resort, after all other cost-saving measures have been fully explored.\"\nThe latest news comes amid a period of enormous uncertainty for Scotland's universities.\nThe University of Dundee is battling to tackle a PS35m deficit and previously announced that 632 positions would be cut.\nEarlier this month, the Unite union said members would be balloted on strike action following reports the institution could cut up to 700 jobs.\nIn February, some staff began three weeks of strike action.\nUCU Scotland said that 74% of its members had backed the walkout, on a turnout of 64%.\nLecturers at RGU in Aberdeen went on strike on Tuesday over redundancies.\nRGU announced in November that more redundancies could be made after 130 staff left through a voluntary severance scheme last year. It hopes there will be fewer than 60 further redundancies.\nThe EIS teaching union said members had been left with \"no other option\" but to take strike action, vowing more strikes in May and September.\nAnd staff at the University of Edinburgh are also being balloted on strike action in a dispute over plans to cut PS140m from its budget and fears of compulsory redundancies.\nSir Peter Mathieson says ministers must act over the future funding model for Scotland's universities.\nUniversity staff posted a notice on Facebook to say Toby, their \"beloved campus cat\" has passed away.\nThe statistics are five times higher than the world figure, a University of Aberdeen study says.\nThe warning comes after concerns about heightened activity by US immigration officials \nThe action is being taken over redundancies, which the university says comes at an extremely challenging time for the sector.\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

      "content": "As the trade war between China and the US escalates, attention has been focused on the increasingly high levels of tit-for-tat tariffs the two countries are imposing on one another.\nBut slapping reciprocal tariffs on Washington is not the only way Beijing has been able to retaliate. \nChina has now also imposed export controls on a range of critical rare earth minerals and magnets, dealing a major blow to the US.\nThe move has laid bare how reliant America is on these minerals.\nThis week, Trump ordered the commerce department to come up with ways to boost US production of critical minerals and cut reliance on imports - an attempt by Washington to reclaim this critical industry. But why exactly are rare earths so important and how could they shake up the trade war? \n\"Rare earths\" are a group of 17 chemically similar elements that are crucial to the manufacture of many high-tech products.\nMost are abundant in nature, but they are known as \"rare\" because it is very unusual to find them in a pure form, and they are very hazardous to extract.\nAlthough you may not be familiar with the names of these rare earths - like Neodymium, Yttrium and Europium - you will be very familiar with the products that they are used in.\nFor instance, Neodymium is used to make the powerful magnets used in loudspeakers, computer hard drives, EV motors and jet engines that enable them to be smaller and more efficient.\nYttrium and Europium are used to manufacture television and computer screens because of the way they display colours.\n\"Everything you can switch on or off likely runs on rare earths,\" explains Thomas Kruemmer, Director of Ginger International Trade and Investment.\nRare earths are also critical to the production of medical technology like laser surgery and MRI scans, as well as key defence technologies.\nChina has a near monopoly on extracting rare earths as well as on refining them - which is the process of separating them from other minerals.\nThe International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates that China accounts for about 61% of rare earth production and 92% of their processing.\nThat means it currently dominates the rare earths supply chain and has the capacity to decide which companies can and cannot receive supplies of rare earths.\nBoth the extraction and processing of these rare earths are costly and polluting. \nAll rare earth resources also contain radioactive elements, which is why many other countries, including those in the EU, are reluctant to produce them.\n\"Radioactive waste from production absolutely requires safe, compliant, permanent disposal. Currently all disposal facilities in EU are temporary,\" says Mr Kruemmer.\nBut China's dominance in the rare earth supply chain didn't take place overnight - but rather, is the result of decades of strategic government policies and investment.\nIn a visit to Inner Mongolia in 1992, the late Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping, who oversaw China's economic reform, famously said: \"The Middle East has oil and China has rare earths\". \n\"Beginning in the late 20th century, China prioritised the development of its rare earth mining and processing capabilities, often at lower environmental standards and labour costs compared to other nations,\" said Gavin Harper, a critical materials research fellow at the University of Birmingham.\n\"This allowed them to undercut global competitors and build a near-monopoly across the entire value chain, from mining and refining to the manufacturing of finished products like magnets.\"\nIn response to tariffs imposed by Washington, China earlier this month began ordering restrictions on the exports of seven rare earth minerals - most of which are known as \"heavy\" rare earths, which are crucial to the defence sector. \nThese are less common and are harder to process than \"light\" rare earths, which also makes them more valuable.\nFrom 4 April, all companies now have to get special export licenses in order to send rare earths and magnets out of the country.\nThat is because as a signatory to the international treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, China has the ability to control the trade of \"dual use products\".\nAccording to the Centre for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), this leaves the US particularly vulnerable as there is no capacity outside China to process heavy rare earths.\nA US Geological report notes that between 2020 and 2023, the US relied on China for 70% of its imports of all rare earth compounds and metals.\nThis means that the new restrictions have the ability to hit the US hard.\nHeavy rare earths are used in many military fields such as missiles, radar, and permanent magnets.\nA CSIS report notes that defence technologies including F-35 jets, Tomahawk missiles and Predator unmanned aerial vehicles all depend on these minerals.\nIt adds that this comes as China \"expands its munitions production and acquires advanced weapons systems and equipment at a pace five to six times faster than the United States\".\n\"The impact on the US defence industry will be substantial,\" said Mr Kroemmer.\nAnd it's not only in the field of defence.\nUS manufacturing, which Trump has said he hopes to revive through the imposition of his tariffs, stand to be severely impacted.\n\"Manufacturers, particularly in defence and high-tech, face potential shortages and production delays due to halted shipments and limited inventories,\" said Dr Harper.\n\"Prices for critical rare earth materials are expected to surge, increasing the immediate costs of components used in a wide range of products, from smartphones to military hardware,\" he says, adding that this could result in potential production slowdowns for affected US companies. \nIf such a shortage from China persists in the long-run, the US could potentially begin diversifying its supply chains and scaling up its domestic and processing capabilities, though this would still require \"substantial and sustained investment, technological advancements and potentially higher overall costs compared to the previous dependence on China\".\nAnd it's clear this is something already on Trump's mind. This week, he ordered an investigation into the national security risks posed by the US' reliance on such critical minerals. \n\"President Trump recognises that an overreliance on foreign critical minerals and their derivative products could jeopardise US defence capabilities, infrastructure development, and technological innovation,\" said the order.\n\"Critical minerals, including rare earth elements, are essential for national security and economic resilience.\"\nThe US has one operational rare earths mine, but it does not have the capacity to separate heavy rare earths and has to send its ore to China for processing.\nThere used to be US companies that manufactured rare earth magnets - until the 1980s, the US was in fact the largest producer of rare earths.\nBut these companies exited the market as China began to dominate in terms of scale and cost.\nThis is largely believed to be part of why US president Donald Trump is so keen to sign a minerals deal with Ukraine - it wants to reduce dependency on China.\nAnother place Trump has had his eye on is Greenland - which is endowed with the eighth largest reserves of rare earth elements. \nTrump has repeatedly showed interest in taking control of the autonomous Danish dependent territory and has refused to rule out economic or military force to take control of it. \nThese might have been places that the US could have sourced some of its rare earth exports from, but the adversarial tone Trump has struck with them means the US could be left with very few alternative suppliers.\n\"The challenge the U.S. faces is two-fold, on the one hand it has alienated China who provides the monopoly supply of rare earths, and on the other hand it is also antagonising many nations that have previously been friendly collaborators through tariffs and other hostile actions,\" said Dr Harper. \n\"Whether they will still prioritise collaboration with America remains to be seen in the turbulent policy environment of this new administration.\"\nChina is encouraging it's retirees to spend their savings on fun initiatives to help boost its economy, as the country's trade war with the US rages on.\nThe firms said operating expenses have risen \"due to recent changes in global trade rules and tariffs\".\nA new initiative aims to boost the local economy by attracting elderly travellers to remote parts of the country.\nThe chip manufacturing giant will require licences to export its H20 AI chip to China.\nBBC Verify's Jake Horton looks into the truth behind the claims, and what we know about how luxury goods are made.\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

The US relies heavily on Chinese imports for rare earths, with a dependence of 70% between 2020-2023.  This move by China has prompted the US to investigate national security risks associated with its reliance on foreign minerals and explore alternative sources like Ukraine or Greenland.  The Trump administration is also considering measures to diversify supply chains and boost domestic production, though this will require significant investment and time.

      "summary": "This week’s Bulls N’ Bears ASX Runner of the Week is… Grand Gulf Energy, after the company acquired an option over a potential billion-barrel oil prospect off the coast of Namibia.",
      "content": "\"Ahhhh stability\" - or at least a little relative stability - was welcomed back to the markets this week.\nThe ASX this week saw some sanity and volume return to trading with the ASX finishing up 1.3 per cent, after a Monday morning sell-off fuelled by Friday losses from the escalating China-United States trade war.\nFollowing China's retaliatory export restrictions on rare earth elements used in defence, energy and automotives - of which China controls some 97 per cent of production for the majority - US President Donald Trump launched a probe into the need for tariffs on critical minerals this week.\nUnderestimating just how dependent dozens of US defence and aerospace companies are on China's rare earth products, the US will perhaps have to look elsewhere for its rare earths. China currently meets 70 per cent of US demand.\nThe probe's announcement saw Australian rare earth and critical minerals stocks take off, securing a stranglehold of two of our four Bulls N' Bears Runners spots on the short week.\nDespite the subdued quiet in markets before the Easter long weekend - relative to the past couple of months - gold continued its legendary march passing US$3000 an ounce just weeks ago to reach a staggering US$3350 per ounce this week.\nThe yellow metal's dominance should not surprise to Runners readers by now but for a country that possesses the most gold reserves in the world, it is a seriously big deal.\nHaving said that, the Bulls N' Bears Runners list does not feature a goldie this week, as rare earths understandably stole the show. The top spot was again awarded to an unlikely all-comer - an Aussie oil and gas minnow that secured an option over a mammoth-scale oil prospect in Africa.\nGRAND GULF ENERGY LTD (ASX: GGE)\nup 167% (0.15c - 0.4c)\nThis week's Bulls N' Bears ASX Runner of the Week is oil and gas exploration company Grand Gulf Energy, which saw its share price go up today after the company announced a binding option agreement to acquire a potential 1.1-billion-barrel oil prospect in the Walvis Basin, in offshore Namibia.\nOffshore Namibia is one of the hottest addresses globally for oil and gas exploration and more than 11 billion barrels of oil have been discovered in the past three years.\nOil and gas super majors active in the region include Shell, Chevron, TotalEnergies and GALP, offering abundant potential suitors for funding arrangements for the seven wells Grand Gulf has planned for 2025.\nThe fanfare and ensuing 167 per cent share price jump on Monday, from 0.15 cents to a peak of 0.4c. This was on the back of an option, over an offshore Namibia application, which still hasn't been approved and must then be converted into a petroleum exploration licence.\nThere is a solid chance it could remain pending for some time and, perhaps, not be permitted at all.\nThat didn't hold some punters back - $220,000 worth of stock traded to open the week. Small-cap oil exploration is about as akin to high-stakes gambling as an investor can find. A successful well can yield multiples in returns, but the more common outcome - a dry well - can nearly wipe out an investment.\nThe exploration block in question covers 16,800 square kilometres in water depths from 1400 metres to 2000m and lies to the south of the Murombe-1 and Wingat-1 wells.\nThe company executed an accompanying $700,000 placement over the weekend to professional and sophisticated gamblers at an issue price of 2c per share. The funds will likely go towards the company's working capital and 'evaluation'.\nMETEORIC RESOURCES (ASX: MEI)\nUp 101% (6.7c - 13.5c)\nMeteoric Resources led the rare earths charge this week, taking out second place on the Runners list after the company unveiled a maiden mineral resource estimate for its Barra do Pacu (BDP) licence within its Caldeira ionic clay project in Brazil.\nThe company's rare earth project falls under the ionic clay classification, a notably cheap-to-exploit mineralisation. To date, it is only the second type of mineralisation - outside of carbonatites such as Lynas Resources' world-class Mt Weld deposit - to be successfully mined.\nThe maiden mineral resource estimate at BDP came in at a substantial 389 million tonnes grading some 2204 parts per million (ppm) total rare earth oxides (TREO), including a high-grade indicated resource of 32Mt grading 4130ppm TREO.\nMeteoric's global Caldeira resource now sits at a whopping 1.5 billion tonnes grading 2359ppm TREO of critical rare earth oxides, including 195,000t yttrium oxide, 195,000t praseodymium oxide, 554,000t neodymium oxide and 65,000t samarium oxide. Yttrium and samarium have both been targeted by China.\nThe company's share price ran throughout the week to close on Friday up more than 100 per cent at 13.5c per share from a close last week of just 6.7c per share.\nMeteoric says its broader global resource contains all the banned Chinese rare earths, except for scandium. The company believes the project could be the next low-cost production alternative outside of China, which it outlined in an initial scoping study in July last year.\nRare earths producers have had a tough time of late. When the world-class Mt Weld project in Western Australia can barely stay afloat, it becomes evident rare earths are decidedly not that rare at all. However, demand for the critical minerals is increasing and non-Chinese alternatives are a must for the US to stabilise supply.\nAUSTRALIAN STRATEGIC MATERIALS LTD (ASX: ASM)\nup 97% (39c - 77c)\nAustralian Strategic Materials (ASM) got on a run early this week prompted by Trump's rare earths dilemma, and the all-knowing ASX booked the company with a speeding ticket on Monday, apparently unaware of why its share price was running.\nASM responded it was not aware of any unknown information, however the company noted that thanks to China's increased export restrictions, it was uniquely positioned to deliver a broad portfolio of rare earth products from ore through to alloy outside of China's influence.\nThe share price ran up 97 per cent by Friday to top at 77c from a close of 39c last week on a very handy $5M in stock traded.\nMany of the materials affected by China's new export restrictions are already available or planned through ASM's alternative supply chain, offering its partners a viable, de-risked solution in the company's Dubbo project in New South Wales.\nASM has been investigating alternative lower capital and shorter implementation options to recover light (neodymium and praseodymium) and heavy (dysprosium and terbium) rare earth elements from the Dubbo project.\nThe company says Dubbo is construction-ready, with all its major permits approved. Dubbo currently contains an estimated 75.18Mt resource at ore grades for heavy rare earths, zirconium, niobium and hafnium.\nNEUROSCIENTIFIC BIOPHARMACEUTICALS LTD (ASX: NSB)\nUp 97% (3.5c - 6.9c)\nNeuroScientific Biopharmaceuticals took out the final spot on the ASX Runners of the Week list, after the neurodegenerative pharmaceutical innovator made a shrewd pickup of the stem cell company, Isopogen WA.\nIsopogen WA holds the rights to utilise its patented StemSmart stem cell technology, which is used to produce a life-changing cellular medicine.\nStemSmart cells interact with a patient's immune system to modulate its response to inflammation. The cellular medicine technology uses cells from adult bone marrow and is grown in culture.\nThe Isopogen acquisition sent NeuroScientific's share price soaring today to peak a huge 97 per cent on the day to 6.9c on $650,000 of stock traded.\nThe company says early indications from a phase two trial in a type of Crohn's disease, which affects the gut, suggest the StemSmart technology is a potent, efficacious and safe therapy suited to a globally massive market.\nCrohn's disease is a type of inflammatory bowel disease, with a global treatment market estimated to be worth US$13.8 billion by 2026.\nAs a result of the acquisition, NeuroScientific had completed a placement to raise $3.5M at 3.5c a share through the boys and girls at Westar Capital. The biotech company hopes the raise will help it to exploit the next powerful technology in regenerative medicine.\nNeuroScientific believes stem cell therapy is a cornerstone of modern medicine. Stem cells have a unique ability to develop into any cell in the body. The stem cells are hailed as the body's master cells. This week's acquisition could potentially be a master stroke by Neuroscientific.\nIs your ASX-listed company doing something interesting?

A 20% \"retaliatory\" tariff on the EU has been temporarily suspended until July.\nMeloni previously called the tariffs \"absolutely wrong\" and said they would end up damaging the EU \"as much as the US\".\nWhile she didn't score any tangible wins on tariffs during the meeting, she did convince Trump to accept an invitation to visit Rome, which she said would be an occasion for him to meet other European leaders.\nGiven the fraught relations between the EU and the US, Meloni will likely chalk that up as a significant win, particularly if Trump agrees to meet the president of the European Commission, Ursula Von der Leyen, during the visit.\nMeloni will return to Europe with stronger credentials as the so-called \"Trump whisperer\", something that will be reinforced when she meets US Vice President JD Vance in Rome tomorrow.\nThe Italian leader was careful to praise Trump and align herself with the US president's viewpoints.\nIn her statement following the meeting, she criticised \"woke ideology\" and championed the \"war against illegal migration\".\n\"The goal for me is to make the West great again, and I think we can do it together,\" she added.\nShe also seized the opportunity to tout the work of her own government. \"I'm proud of sitting here as prime minister of an Italy that today has a very good situation - a stable country, a reliable country,\" Meloni said. \nShe noted that her government had brought inflation down and improved employment, before gesturing towards Trump and adding with a broad smile: \"Forgive me if I promote my country, but you're a businessman and you understand me\". Trump grinned back.\nMeloni basked in the praise lavished on her by Trump - from compliments about her work as prime minister to gushing about her Italian sounding \"beautiful\".\nThe US president praised Meloni for taking a tough stance on immigration and said he wished more people were like her. Meloni said that change was happening, thanks to the example set by Italy, referring to yesterday's EU announcement on safe countries.\nIt was only occasionally that she showed a tinge of irritation when asked about Italy's low defence spending.\nMeloni said that she expects Italy to announce at the next Nato meeting in June that her country would be able to meet the alliance's requirement that each member nation spends 2% of GDP on defence.\nDefence spending has been a key sticking point for Trump, with the US leader repeatedly demanding that Nato allies increase spending. \nItaly is one of eight countries that currently does not meet the 2% threshold, spending 1.49% on defence.\nItalian opposition leader Carlo Calenda said there had been \"two very positive outcomes\" from the visit: that Meloni \"stayed on track on Ukraine and managed to convince Trump to meet EU figures in Italy\".\nCalenda said Meloni had \"gained credibility as a bridge between the US and the EU\" but criticised her praise of \"Trump's fight on woke culture\".\nEarlier this year, King Charles III invited Donald Trump for an unprecedented second state visit.\nHomeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem accused the institution of \"threatening national security\". \nThe Trump administration is headed on a collision course with the judicial branch, a rare and historic scenario.\nPeople coming into Great Britain can no longer bring cured meats or cheese from the EU following an outbreak of foot and mouth disease.\nDifferent rules on farming standards on either side of the Atlantic could make a trade deal tricky\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

Meloni, the first European leader to visit since Trump imposed tariffs on EU imports, aims to bridge the fractured relationship between the US and Europe. While no concrete trade deal was reached, Meloni secured an invitation for Trump to visit Rome, where he will meet with other European leaders. The meeting saw both sides praising each other's stances on issues like immigration and defense spending, although Meloni faced some criticism for her praise of Trump's \"woke culture\" stance.

      "content": "Watch CBS News \n Updated on: April 17, 2025 / 2:20 PM EDT\n / CBS News \n Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni is meeting at the White House on Thursday with President Trump, in what her aides have called a high-stakes \"commercial peace mission.\"\nEuropean leaders are hoping Italy's right-wing premier can position herself as a bridge between the Trump administration and the European Union, which Mr. Trump and his top aides have bashed as a deadbeat, if not abusive partner on defense and trade.\nMr. Trump told reporters Thursday that \"of course\" there will be a trade deal with the EU, amid the 90-day pause on his \"reciprocal\" tariffs. Asked if the EU is on his priority list of nations for reaching trade deals, Mr. Trump said, \"Everybody's on my priority list.\" \nThe president said he and Meloni discussed trade and \"many, many things\" in their first meeting of the day. But it's unclear how much progress Mr. Trump and Meloni made in discussing any sort of trade deal. \nThe hope not only in Rome, but in EU capitals across the 27-nation bloc is likely that Meloni can persuade Mr. Trump not to impose the steep tariff hikes he's threatened, which could devastate European economies. A reporter asked Meloni if she believes the U.S. is a reliable partner. \n\"If I wouldn't think it's a reliable partner, I wouldn't be here,\" Meloni responded. \nMeloni said she's \"here to find the best way to make us both stronger.\" \n\"The goal for me is to make the West great again,\" Meloni said. \"And I think we can do it together.\"\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent told reporters he believes there have been trade calls with the EU already, and the U.S. is trying to work with the world's 15 largest economies first. The president said \"tariffs are making us rich.\" \nMeloni has positioned herself as the European leader Mr. Trump is most likely to listen to. The two have developed a relationship based on shared political and ideological affinities on issues including immigration and LGBTQ rights. \nMeloni was the only European leader to be invited to Mr. Trump's inauguration in January, and he has praised her multiple times, calling her a \"fantastic leader and person,\" and someone he could potentially work with to \"straighten out the world a little bit.\"\nAfter the reopening of the Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris last year, which both leaders attended, Mr. Trump was quoted by the New York Post as saying: \"I was with her a lot\" and \"we get along great.\"\nBut the Italian leader will have to try to balance that budding special relationship with her mandate to protect the interests not only of her own nation's economy, but the EU's, with which Italy's financial future is inextricably linked. \nMeloni and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen discussed strategies on how to approach her meeting with Mr. Trump during multiple phone calls ahead of the trip, according to a commission spokesperson. \nVon der Leyen herself has not yet been granted a meeting with Mr. Trump, despite repeated requests. Meloni's sit-down at the White House will be the first with any European leader since the administration announced its tariffs on virtually every nation with which the U.S. conducts trade at the beginning of April. The EU was hit with a blanket 20% tariff rate on all exports to the U.S. with that announcement, though Mr. Trump put those higher rates on hold for 90 days about a week later, as global stock markets reeled, leaving a 10% universal rate in place.\nMeloni has gently chided the sweeping tariffs on the EU as \"wrong,\" but she's been one of the voices urging the continental bloc not to impose retaliatory measures, insisting that a calm response focused on negotiations would bring a more constructive resolution.\nThe White House claims dozens of counties have come forward seeking to negotiate new trade agreements with the U.S., with Mr. Trump boasting that leaders were calling him and \"kissing my ass,\" begging to strike deals to avoid the reimposition of the higher levies.\n\"We know we're going through a difficult period, let's see how it goes in the coming hours. I am feeling no pressure, as you can imagine, for my next two days,\" Meloni said with a note of clear irony at an awards ceremony two days before her White House meeting. \"I am aware of what I represent, and I am aware of what I am defending.\"\nNot all European politicians were so sanguine about the potential outcome of the Trump-Meloni meeting, however. Italian opposition politician Carlo Calenda said, \"the most important thing is that Meloni does not allow herself to be used by Trump to split the European front.\"\nIn other European capitals, there was clear anxiety over the possibility that the White House could use the meeting to try to undermine EU unity.\n\"If we start having bilateral discussions, obviously it will break the current dynamic,\" the French government's Minister for Industry and Energy, Marc Ferracci, said last week, adding: \"Europe is only strong if it is united.\" \nThe French news agency AFP said a government spokeswoman later stressed that any voices capable of encouraging dialogue between Washington and the EU were to be welcomed. That statement echoed the remarks by the EU spokesperson on Monday, who noted the close coordination between Meloni and Von der Leyen ahead of the Italian leader's trip to Washington and said the \"outreach is very welcome.\"\nAfter her brief visit to Washington the Italian leader will return home, where she's expected to meet on Friday with Vice President JD Vance during his visit to the Italian capital and the Vatican.\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Irish Prime Minister Micheal Martin have met with Mr. Trump in the Oval Office since he took office for his second term, but those encounters all came prior to the massive tariffs announcement on April 2. \n (c) 2025 CBS Interactive Inc.

European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen recognises that and they have been speaking regularly ahead of the trip.\nTrump and Meloni famously enjoy a good relationship and have lavished praise on one another in the past. He has called her a \"fantastic woman\" who has \"really taken Europe by storm\".\nFor her part, Meloni - who has headed a right-wing coalition government since 2022 - is ideologically closer to Trump than to some of her European neighbours. \nIn a video message to a US conservative conference in February, she echoed some of Trump's common talking points, railing against mass migration, \"globalist elites\" and \"woke ideology\". \nShe was also the only European leader to attend the US president's inauguration in January, and has steered clear of overtly criticising the work of his administration since.\nThe harshest criticism she has dispensed was earlier this month, when she said Trump's decision to impose 20% tariffs on the EU was \"absolutely wrong\" and that it would end up damaging the EU \"as much as the US\".\n\"Meloni has always said that Europe shouldn't take any decisions that put it on a collision course with the US, and that Europe should adapt rather than resist,\" said Riccardo Alcaro of the Italian Institute for International Affairs in Rome.\n\"If the Trump administration is immovable on tariffs, she'll agree to counter-tariffs. But her first move is always to say no. Because ultimately she thinks the importance of the West in the world is thanks to the US, and that the West revolves around the US.\"\nMeloni's world view is also closer to that of many of Trump's main allies than many of her European neighbours.\n\"She knows that Italy is strategically, politically and economically subordinate to the EU - but she also has a genuine proximity to MAGA Republicans,\" Alcaro added.\nUS Vice-President JD Vance is due to travel to Rome on Friday for Easter, and will see Meloni as well as leading officials at the Vatican.\nMeloni's natural affinity to an administration many in Europe are having trouble finding common ground with has sparked concern among some Europeans that, in the privacy of the Oval Office, she may be tempted to go at it alone and argue for more favourable terms for Italy.\nLast week France's Industry Minister Marc Ferracci spoke out against \"bilateral talks\" and warned Trump's strategy was to \"divide Europeans\". \nHis comments irritated Rome and had to be toned down later by a French government spokesperson.\nThe European Commission has signalled it has confidence in Meloni, and a spokeswoman said \"any outreach to the US [was] very welcome\". \nHowever, the spokeswoman also said Meloni's trip was being \"closely coordinated\" with the institutions, and underlined that handling trade policy was a job for the EU. \nThe EU negotiates on behalf of all member states, and no single country can negotiate lower tariffs for its own benefit. \nMeloni's team appears clear on this and Italian Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani said that Meloni \"isn't going to negotiate for Italy against Europe but is going to champion a European stance\".\nUltimately the Italian leader's mission may be to emphasise to Trump that the EU is keen to reach a zero-tariff agreement and commit to buying American - especially when it comes to defence and liquified natural gas (LNG).\nAnd, in more hushed tones, she may also tell him that Europe is in no rush to make any deals with China. \n\"I don't know how public this will be but I think there will be some anti-China discourse as an incentive for the US administration,\" Riccardo Alcaro said.\nAt home, party allies were singing Meloni's praises before her plane to Washington even left the ground. \n\"This meeting shows Giorgia Meloni's courage and stature,\" said Brothers of Italy (FdI) MP Augusta Montarulli - although Senator Giovanbattista Fazzolari, somewhat less encouragingly, warned the trip would be \"full of potential pitfalls\". \nAnd centre-left opposition parties took the opportunity to berate Meloni's proximity to the Trump administration. \n\"I have a feeling that upon her return Meloni will be flying the Trump flag rather than Italy's or Europe's,\" said Peppe Provenzano of the Democratic Party (PD). \n\"I hope to be proven wrong.\"\nAt an awards ceremony in Rome on Tuesday, Meloni addressed a room packed with entrepreneurs and business leaders - the very same who stand to lose the most from Trump's tariffs.\nLooking ahead to her trip to Washington, she chuckled nervously.\n\"As you can imagine,\" she joked, \"I'm feeling no pressure at all.\"\nIt is the second major case Google has lost in a year, after it was found to have a monopoly on online search.\nThe pause is a major blow to the US's wind energy industry which has been targeted by President Trump.\nOne person was taken into custody after the shooting on Thursday, according to CBS News, the BBC's US partner.\nThe pair hope to take a step towards release - decades after killing their parents in a high-profile US case.\nBBC Verify looks at the evidence behind allegations that the Salvadoran mistakenly deported to a mega-prison was a dangerous gang member.\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

Scholz failed to get a meeting with Trump and Merz's request is reportedly pending.\nMeloni had previously described Trump's tariffs on EU goods as \"wrong\" but she appears to be taking a more cautious approach as she manages a delicate balancing act between her political ideals, which are more in tune with Trump's, and Italy's role within the EU.\nThe meeting provoked trepidation among some of Italy's European allies as well as Meloni's domestic opposition amid fears their closeness risks jeopardising the bloc's unified approach to the tariffs and other issues.\nEnrico Borghi, a politician with the centrist Italia Viva party, told a TV talkshow: \"The advice from the opposition is that the prime minister returns home with reopened negotiations between the US and EU that will guarantee a framework of relative tranquility to our economic and productive system, which has been weakened by what is a real trade war.\"\nItaly is the third-largest exporter to the US from the EU.

Having complained that the football gods were against him last week, Dominic Solanke's penalty after an intervention from the video assistant referee - another of the Tottenham manager's pet peeves - was enough to seal progress to the semi-finals of the Europa League.\nPostecoglou may have regretted his decision to point out back in September after a defeat to Arsenal that he \"always\" wins trophies in his second year at a club. But after their north London rivals eased past the might of Real Madrid 24 hours earlier, Spurs also still have something to hang on to in a season that has otherwise been filled with disappointment.\nA showdown with Bodo/Glimt or Lazio awaits in the last four after this dogged display against an Eintracht Frankfurt side who could not break down a disciplined Tottenham defence. Solanke had not scored since 4 January - a run of 12 matches - but there were unbridled celebrations in the away end when he stroked home the decisive spot-kick just before half-time and at the full-time whistle after more than five minutes of injury time.\nPostecoglou has increasingly cut a defiant figure in recent weeks as results in the Premier League have gone from bad to worse despite the return from injury of several key players. The Australian spikily suggested beforehand that Spurs supporters should not take being one match away from the last four of a European competition as a regular occurrence \"because it certainly hasn't been for this club\". In the absence of the captain, Son Heung-min, due to a foot injury, Mathys Tel was the only change from the 1-1 draw in the first leg, while Frankfurt were unchanged.\nTheir manager, Dino Toppmoller, had urged his players to make home advantage count after surviving a Tottenham onslaught during the second half in north London last week. The Frankfurt supporters packed out the end behind one of the goals almost an hour before kick-off and there was an electric atmosphere as they unfurled a tifo when the players emerged with the message \"the Eagles are on the hunt\" with trophies representing their two previous triumphs in this competition and its predecessor, the Uefa Cup.\nAlmost 3,000 Spurs fans also braved the incessant rain as Jean-Matteo Bahoya and Mario Gotze both tested Guglielmo Vicario's handling on the greasy surface with early shots. There was a moment of panic when Hugo Ekitike raced on to a long punt forward from goalkeeper Kaua Santos but Micky van den Ven ate up the ground to get back just in time. Gotze's evening came to a premature end when he was taken off clutching his hamstring just before Tottenham had their first sight of goal in the 20th minute, although Tel could not make proper contact with Brennan Johnson's cutback. The Frenchman was on target with his next effort from distance that drew a good save from Santos, with Pedro Porro pelted by plastic cups as he prepared to take the resulting corner.\nPostecoglou will have been pleased with how his side had grown into the game and he was given even more hope on the stroke of half-time. Santos thought he had escaped when he clattered dangerously into James Madison but VAR thought differently to the Armenian referee and sent him to the replay screen. Tel initially looked as if he would take it but eventually Solanke sent the goalkeeper the wrong way as a groggy Maddison was replaced by Dejan Kulusevski after trying to carry on.\nOne of Toppmoller's assistants was sent off after reacting to a foul by Johnson that earned him a yellow card just before the break and the hosts began the second half feeling hard done by. A free-kick from 35 yards out from Gotze's replacement, Fares Chaibi, that had Vicario sprawling across his goal, must have quickened Postecoglou's pulse.

He described the tariffs as \"extremely regrettable\" and urged the White House to pursue a deal that would strengthen both economies.\nHe said he was \"very grateful\" that the US president met his delegation, which also held talks with US Treasury secretary Scott Bessent and trade representative Jamieson Greer.\nBessent wrote on X on Thursday that the \"discussions on trade are progressing in a highly satisfactory direction\", and looked forward to more talks with \"our friends from Japan soon\". \nThe US-Japan talks are being closely scrutinised by governments around the world for clues on Trump's strategy in escalating a global trade war.\nJapan, America's biggest outside investor and closest ally in Asia, has a great deal at risk in economic and security terms if relations with Washington sour. \nThe US has already imposed a 25 per cent tariff on Japanese cars, steel and aluminium and has refused a succession of requests for exemptions from Tokyo.\nThe prospect of an additional 24 per cent levy under Trump's \"reciprocal\" tariff regime has shaken corporate Japan and led Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba to declare a \"national crisis\". \nJapan recorded a Y=9tn ($63bn) trade surplus with the US for the fiscal year to the end of March, its finance ministry announced on Thursday, down 1.3 per cent from the previous year.\nSpeaking to reporters in Tokyo on Thursday morning, Ishiba highlighted Japan's potential advantage from its trade negotiations being a top priority for Trump.\n\"Of course, the negotiations will not be easy going forward,\" he warned.\nAhead of joining the talks, Trump signalled he would raise the question of whether Japan should bear a greater financial burden for hosting US military forces at bases around the country.\nThe US president has repeatedly described the allies' security treaty as \"unfair\", last week repeating the assertion that \"we pay hundreds of billions of dollars to defend them . . . they don't pay anything\".\nJapan pays about $1.4bn a year towards the cost of supporting the US military presence. \nRecommended\nThe prospect that the next round of talks would involve Japan pledging higher defence spending boosted shares in Japanese defence contractors, with IHI rising 5 per cent, Kawasaki Heavy Industries gaining 6.3 per cent and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries up 1.6 per cent on Thursday.\nAccording to Akazawa, the talks did not cover foreign exchange issues and the weak yen, a preoccupation for the US administration.\nTalks on that issue would be conducted separately between Bessent and Japan's finance minister Katsunobu Kato, he said.\nAkazawa later reiterated Japan's position that it was not manipulating markets to weaken the yen.",
      "ml_hf_summary": "US President Donald Trump met with Ryosei Akazawa, Japan's chief trade negotiator, in an effort to negotiate the removal of US tariffs on Japanese goods.  The meeting resulted in agreement to hold a second meeting this month and seek a quick resolution to the trade dispute. The tariffs have caused significant economic turmoil for Japan, leading to a decline in its trade surplus with the US.  Japan's Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has declared a \"national crisis\" due to the prospect of additional tariffs. Trump also raised the issue of Japan potentially contributing more financially to hosting US military bases in the country. \n"

      "content": "Chinese online retail giants Shein and Temu have warned US customers that goods will get pricier from next week, after President Donald Trump imposed hefty tariffs on goods from China.\nIn almost identical statements, the rival companies said they have seen operating expenses rise \"due to recent changes in global trade rules and tariffs\", adding they will make \"price adjustments\" from 25 April.\nThe shopping sites have gained tens of millions of customers in the US, attracted by their ultra-low prices. \nTheir popularity has put pressure on Amazon, prompting it to launch a new platform called Haul last November, featuring items for under $20 (PS15.10). \nSince returning to the White House in January, Trump has imposed taxes of up to 145% on imports from China. His administration said this week that when the new tariffs are added on to existing ones the levies on some Chinese goods could reach 245%.\nTrump has also ended a duty-free exemption for goods worth less than $800, which helped Shein and Temu make rapid inroads to the US market.\nUS lawmakers on both sides had raised concerns about how these companies had \"exploited\" the provision. \nAn estimated 1.4 billion packages entered the US under this arrangement last year, up from 140 million in 2013, according to US customs authorities.\nSince Trump started imposing the tariffs, Shein and Temu have seen the ranking of their apps fall sharply.\nTemu is now the 75th most downloaded free app on the US Apple Store, after having consistently taken one of the top five spots in the last two years. Shein is in 58th place, down from number 15 last month. \nBut other Chinese retail apps continue to be ranked highly in the US, including DHgate in second place and Alibaba's Taobao at number seven. \nShein and Temu have also slashed their advertising spending in the US. \nTemu has \"turned off all their Google Shopping ads in the US\" as of 9 April, Mike Ryan, head of e-commerce insights at online advertising agency Smarter Ecommerce, said on LinkedIn.\nTemu's average daily US advertising spend on social media platforms include Facebook, Instagram and YouTube fell by 31% in the two weeks leading to 13 April, compared with the past month.\nShein's average daily US ad spend fell by 19% over the same period, according to data from market intelligence firm Sensor Tower. \nIn their statements, Temu and Shein encouraged customers to shop before higher prices kick in.\n\"We stand ready to make sure your orders arrive smoothly during this time.\n\"We're doing everything we can to keep prices low and minimize the impact on you. Our team is working hard to improve your shopping experience,\" the statements said. \nTemu and Shein did not immediately respond to requests from the BBC for further comment.\nEarlier this year, King Charles III invited Donald Trump for an unprecedented second state visit.\n\"There will be a trade deal, 100%,\" Trump said, while Meloni said she was \"sure\" they could reach agreement.\nThe international economic group predicts \"notable markdowns, but not recession\".\nHomeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem accused the institution of \"threatening national security\". \nThe Trump administration is headed on a collision course with the judicial branch, a rare and historic scenario.\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

Trump's trade policies, including ending a duty-free exemption for goods under $800, have contributed to the price increases.

      "content": "After British actress Aimee Lou Wood called a Saturday Night Live (SNL) sketch that impersonated her using exaggerated prosthetic teeth \"mean and unfunny,\" impressionists have told BBC News how they tread the line between being funny and offensive.\nIt all began with five minutes on NBC last Saturday night. \nTitled The White Potus - a spin on hit HBO dark comedy The White Lotus - a SNL sketch depicted US president Donald Trump, his family and top team spending time at a fictional tropical hotel.\nAfter jokes showing Eric Trump blending a gold Rolex watch and Ivanka Trump rejecting a spiritual call to give up material wealth, Wood's White Lotus character Chelsea is portrayed by cast member Sarah Sherman using a pronounced accent and large teeth.\nIn response to a comment made by a character playing US Health Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr, she asks: \"Fluoride? What's that?\"\nThe mineral is added to some water supplies and brands of toothpaste to help prevent tooth decay.\nFor BBC Radio 4's Dead Ringers star Jan Ravens, the first misstep of the writers behind the SNL sketch was \"not reading the room\".\nIt was a bad idea to joke about someone's appearance in a sketch about The White Lotus, Ravens says, given Wood's casting has been praised for a character lacking \"those all-American, fake-looking teeth\".\n\"In the wake of all that, she's been talking about how she was bullied at school and the butt of jokes. So then you think, 'why would you do that joke'?\"\nIt meant that in making fun of Wood's appearance, the sketch \"punched down,\" says Ravens.\n\"You might make a joke about Donald Trump's appearance because you're definitely not punching down on the most powerful man in the western world.\"\nRonni Ancona, co-writer and star of the early 2000s TV series The Big Impression, said she \"could see\" that the writers were also trying to make a point about US Health Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr's pledge to remove fluoride from US drinking water.\nBut in doing so, \"they would have made this tenuous link between fluoride and Aimee Lou's teeth. It's a bit of a cheap shot,\" she told BBC Breakfast on Tuesday.\nAfter the show aired, Wood, 31, said she was \"not thin skinned\" and understood that SNL was about \"caricature\".\n\"But the whole joke was about fluoride,\" she wrote on Sunday. \"I have big gap teeth not bad teeth.\"\nLater on, in a post on social media, she said: \"I've had apologies from SNL.\"\nHowever, Francine Lewis, a comedian whose impersonations have earned her a large following on social media, says the whole purpose of the US show is to \"take the mick\".\nWhile she can sympathise with someone being \"embarrassed\" by being the target of a sketch, Lewis adds that she thinks Wood's response was \"too sensitive\".\nIn her own impressions of celebrities, which include TV stars Gemma Collins and Stacey Solomon, Lewis has stuffed a pillow up her top to appear to be physically larger and put cotton wool on her teeth \"to make them really white and jut out a bit\".\nIn recent times, both fans and some of her targets have taken offence. \n\"I don't know if it's just the new generation of young people that just take offence to every little thing,\" she says.\n\"People that say you're a troll, you're a bully... I find myself hiding at celebrity events because I think 'oh I do their impression, they might not like me'.\"\nBut she believes that being impersonated is actually a marker of someone's popularity and fame, saying that \"it means you've arrived\".\nRather than adapting her impressions, Lewis is steadfast in her belief that \"to make comedy funny, unfortunately you have to overstep the mark.\"\nIt's a view shared by Steve Nallon, known for impersonating former UK Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher on satirical TV programme Spitting Image. \n\"What caricaturists do by nature... is exaggerate the physicality. If a caricaturist is stopped from doing that, there's no point in him being a caricaturist,\" he says.\nDuring the 1980s, one of his targets - former Labour minister Roy Hattersley - was mocked for a slight speech impediment, with water spurting out of his mouth as he spoke.\n\"The joke was Roy Hattersley spits,\" says Nallon, who adds that Hattesley allegedly got on board with the joke after initially taking offence.\nFor Nallon, those in the public eye will always be fair game. \"Maybe it's not a bad lesson to learn that you've got to have the mickey taken out of you occasionally,\" he says.\nBut times have changed. Ravens says that \"people are much more sensitive\" about targeting certain aspects of people's appearances and mannerisms \"than they used to be earlier on in my career, for example, and I think rightly so\".\nThis is not the first time SNL has received criticism of their portrayals.\nIt doesn't mean the comedy is lost, says Ravens. In political satire - which was the main thrust of the SNL sketch - a really good impression satirises what the person is saying, rather than just fixating on how they look or how they deliver it, she adds.\nDuring our phone interview, she seamlessly breaks into an impression of former UK Prime Minister Theresa May, but notes that just speaking in a tense, clipped way, \"is only good for one line really\".\n\"You're pricking pomposity and you're exposing hypocrisy. That's the point of satire.\"\nGet our flagship newsletter with all the headlines you need to start the day.

But that's about to change. \n Climate reporter\n @SeabrookClimate\n \n Thursday 17 April 2025 11:25, UK\nA team of Japanese scientists have created chunks of lab-grown chicken - in a \"breakthrough\" experts say could pave the way for the creation of larger cuts of meat.\nIn the quest to cultivate meat without the climate impact of farmed animals, scientists have so far only been able to grow tiny chunks of animal cells that have been used to recreate minced meat products like pork meatballs.\nBut a Japanese team has pioneered a new method to grow larger pieces of chicken in a lab, which they say recreates the texture and structure of a piece of meat that has so far proved so elusive.\nIndependent experts have hailed it a \"breakthrough\" and a \"meaningful technical achievement\".\nThe researchers involved believe it paves the way for whole cuts of chicken, beef, and fish to be grown in the lab.\n\"Cultured meat offers a sustainable, ethical alternative to conventional meat,\" said Shoji Takeuchi from Tokyo University, senior author of the paper published this week in peer-reviewed journal Trends in Biotechnology.\n\"However, replicating the texture and taste of whole-cut meat remains difficult. Our technology enables the production of structured meat with improved texture and flavour.\"\nTheir method used fine hollow fibres that mimic blood vessels to deliver oxygen and nutrients to living chicken muscle cells, growing them into lumps of meat up to 2cm long and 1cm thick, weighing 10 grams.\n\"These fibres are already commonly used in household water filters and dialysis machines for patients with kidney disease.\n\"It's exciting to discover that these tiny fibres can also effectively help create artificial tissues and, possibly, whole organs in the future.\"\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player \n Overcoming the 'ick factor'\nProf Derek Stewart from The James Hutton Institute, told Sky News: \"I'd class this as a technical breakthrough\".\nDr Rodrigo Amaro-Ledesma from Imperial College London called it a \"meaningful technical achievement that they have produced a cultivated chicken meat several centimetres thick\".\nThis, combined with other work on fine-tuning flavours and reducing costs, puts us \"comfortably on track towards an exciting and appealing new range of products\", he said.\nBut in order for cultivated meat products to \"hit the supermarket shelves in a big way, they need to also be a hit with consumers\".\nBe the first to get Breaking News\nInstall the Sky News app for free\nThe industry prefers the term \"alternative protein\" to \"lab-grown meat\" because it is worried the former gives people the \"ick\".\nOne survey by the Food Standards Agency found a third of UK consumers would be willing to try lab-grown meat.\nAlthough the science has advanced rapidly in recent years, no products have yet been authorised for humans to eat, though they have for pets.\nFollow our channel and never miss an update.\nBut the government wants to change that, last year announcing PS15m of funding, topping up PS23m from other sources, to try to get them onto our plates in the next two years.\nThat includes speeding up the approvals process so that it can keep up with the evolving science, and lowering currently high input costs.\nDr Amaro-Ledesma added: \"Cultivated meat is a promising alternative to conventional meat because it offers the potential to reduce environmental impacts (e.g. greenhouse gas emissions, land and water use), eliminate the need for animal slaughter, and improve food safety by avoiding the use of antibiotics and reducing the risk of zoonotic diseases, amongst other advantages.\"\nLydia Collas, head of natural environment at Green Alliance, said: \"We keep seeing exciting breakthroughs towards more sustainable sources of protein, and with decisive action this can be a real opportunity for the UK.\n\"We already have a lead, thanks to our world-leading biotech industry and high food quality and safety standards.\n\"The government's forthcoming industrial strategy must include measures to grow the UK industry, which, according to our research, could add PS6.8bn to the UK economy every year and create 25,000 new jobs by 2035.\"",

Experts consider this a significant technical achievement as it addresses the challenge of replicating the texture and taste of whole-cut meat. The research team believes this advancement could lead to the development of cultivated meat products that are both sustainable and appealing to consumers.  The UK government has allocated funding to accelerate the approval process for these products, aiming to have them available on supermarket shelves within the next two years. \n"

We disagree with the court's decision regarding our publisher tools. Publishers have many options and they choose Google because our ad tech tools are simple, affordable and effective.\"\nThe ruling is the latest win for the former antitrust officials appointed by ex-president Joe Biden who brought and litigated the case before Donald Trump returned to the White House.\nJonathan Kanter, the former head of the DoJ's antitrust unit, said in a post on X on Thursday: \"Today is a huge victory for antitrust enforcement, the media industry, and the free and open internet . . . Google is now an illegal monopolist twice over.\"\nAntitrust officials appointed by Trump have strongly signalled they intend to adopt a tough stance on enforcement, especially against Big Tech. The US Federal Trade Commission this week began making its case against Meta in a monopoly trial in Washington federal court.\nRecommended\n\"This is a landmark victory in the ongoing fight to stop Google from monopolising the digital public square,\" US attorney-general Pam Bondi said in a statement. \"This Department of Justice will continue taking bold legal action to protect the American people from encroachments on free speech and free markets by tech companies.\"\nThe EU's competition chief Teresa Ribera said earlier on Thursday: \"We take note of the decision and we will study it with interest. The case being analysed by the European Commission continues.\"\nThe commission is also investigating Google for favouring its own advertising services.\nAdditional reporting by Barbara Moens in Brussels",

Google plans to appeal the ruling regarding their publisher tools, while the DoJ seeks remedies including forcing Google to sell parts of its business. This decision follows a previous antitrust case where Google was found to have illegally maintained a monopoly on search. The second phase of that trial will begin next week, with potential remedies including requiring Google to divest assets or cease payments to Apple for its default search engine.  The ruling is considered a significant victory for antitrust enforcement and the media industry, as it marks the latest in a series of legal challenges against Google's dominance in digital advertising. \n"

      "summary": "Could discoveries of alien life ever change the human psyche in how we view ourselves and each other?",
      "content": "Listen to this article on BBC Sounds\nThere are some scientific discoveries that do much more than advance our knowledge: they create a shift in our psyche as they show us the scale of the Universe and our place in it. \nOne such moment was when space craft sent back images of the Earth for the first time. Another is the discovery of life on another world, a moment that has inched a little closer today with the news that signs of a gas, which on Earth is produced by simple marine organisms, has been found on a planet called K2-18b.\nNow, the prospect of really finding alien life - meaning we are not alone in the Universe - is not far away, according to the scientist leading the team that made the detection.\n\"This is basically as big as it gets in terms of fundamental questions, and we may be on the verge of answering that question,\" says Prof Nikku Madhusudhan of the Institute of Astronomy at Cambridge University.\nBut all of this prompts even more questions, including, if they do find life on another world, how will this change us as a species?\nOur ancestors have long created stories of beings that might dwell in the skies. In the early 20th Century, astronomers thought they could see straight line features on the Martian surface, raising speculation that one of our nearest planets might be home to an advanced civilisation: an idea that spawned a wealth of pulp science fiction culture involving flying saucers and little green aliens.\nIt was during an era when western governments generated fear of the spread of communism, so visitors from outer space were more often than not portrayed as menaces, bringing peril rather than hope.\nBut decades on, what has been described as \"the strongest evidence yet\" of life on another world has come, not from Mars or Venus, but from a planet hundreds of trillions of miles away orbiting a distant star.\nPart of the challenge when it comes to researching the existence of alien life is knowing where to look. \nUntil relatively recently, the focus for Nasa's search for life was Mars, but that began to change in 1992 with the discovery of the first planet orbiting another star outside of our solar system. \nAlthough astronomers had suspected that there were other worlds around distant stars there had been no proof until that point. Since then, nearly 6,000 planets outside our solar system have been discovered.\nMany are so-called gas giants, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. Others are either too hot or too cold to support liquid water, thought to be essential for life. \nBut many are in what astronomers call \"The Goldilocks Zone\" where the distance is \"just right\" to support life. Prof Madhusudhan believes there could be thousands in our galaxy.\nAs these so-called exoplanets were being discovered, scientists began to develop instruments to analyse the chemical composition of their atmospheres. Their ambition was breathtaking, some would say audacious. \nThe idea was to capture the tiny amount of starlight glancing through the atmospheres of these faraway worlds and study them for chemical fingerprints of molecules, which on Earth can only be produced by living organisms, so-called biosignatures.\nAnd they succeeded in developing such instruments for ground and space-based telescopes.\nNasa's James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), which detected the gas on the planet called K2-18b in this week's discovery, is the most powerful space telescope ever built and its launch in 2021 generated excitement that the search for life was at long last within humanity's grasp.\nBut JWST has its limits - it can't detect faraway planets as small as ours or as close to their parent stars, because of the glare. So, Nasa is planning the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO), scheduled for the 2030s, which will be able to spot and sample the atmospheres of planets similar to our own. (This is possible using what is effectively a high-tech sunshield that minimises light from the star which a planet orbits.)\nAlso coming online later this decade is the European Southern Observatory (ESO)'s Extremely Large Telescope (ELT), which will be on the ground, looking up at the crystal-clear skies of the Chilean desert. \nIt has the largest mirror of any instrument built, 39-metres in diameter, and so can see vastly more detail at planetary atmospheres than its predecessors.\nProf Madhusudan, however, hopes to have enough data within two years to demonstrate categorically that he really has discovered the biosignatures around K2-18b. But even if he does achieve his aim, this won't lead to mass celebrations about the discovery of life on another world. \nInstead, it will be the start of another robust scientific debate about whether the biosignature could be produced by non-living means.\nEventually though, as more data is gathered from more atmospheres and as chemists fail in finding alternative explanations for biosignatures, the scientific consensus will slowly and gradually shift towards the probability that life does exist on other worlds, according to Prof Catherine Heymans, from Edinburgh University, who is Scotland's Astronomer Royal.\n\"With more time on telescopes, astronomers will get a clearer vision of the chemical compositions of these atmospheres. You won't know that it's definitely life. But I think the more data that's built up, and that if you see this in multiple different systems, not just this one particular planet, it gives us more confidence\".\nThe world wide web emerged in a series of incremental technological breakthroughs that didn't necessarily feel of enormous consequence at the time. \nIn similar fashion, it may dawn on people that possibly the most enormous scientific, cultural and social transformation in the whole of human history has happened, but that the moment the balance was tipped in terms of there being other life out there was not fully recognised at the time.\nA much more definitive discovery would be to discover life in our own solar system using robotic space craft containing portable laboratories. Any off-world bug could be analysed, possibly even brought back to Earth, providing prima facie evidence to at least significantly limit any scientific push back that may ensue.\nThe scientific case for the possibility of life or past life in our own solar system has increased in recent years following data sent back by various spacecraft, so several missions to search for signs of it are on their way.\nThe European Space Agency's (ESA) ExoMars rover, planned for launch in 2028, will drill below the surface of Mars to search for signs of past and possibly present life. Given the extreme conditions on Mars, however, the discovery of fossilised past life is the more likely outcome.\nChina's Tianwen-3 mission, also planned for launch in 2028 is designed to collect samples and bring them back to Earth by 2031. Nasa and ESA each have spacecraft on their way to the icy moons of Jupiter to see if there may be water, possibly vast oceans, under their icy surfaces.\nBut the spacecraft are not designed to find life itself. Instead, these missions lay the ground for future missions which will, according to Prof Michele Dougherty of Imperial College, London.\n\"It is a long, slow process,\" she says. \"The next decision to make would be a lander, which moon it goes to, and where we should be landing. \n\"You don't want to land where the ice crust is so thick that there is no way you can get underneath the surface. And so, it's a long, slow burn, but it's pretty exciting en route\".\nNasa is also sending a spacecraft called Dragonfly to land on one of the moons of Saturn, Titan in 2034. It is an exotic world with what are thought to be lakes and clouds made from carbon-rich chemicals which give the planet an eerie orange haze, bringing The Beatles' song, Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds to mind: a world with \"marmalade skies\". \nAlong with water these chemicals are thought to be a necessary ingredient for life.\nProf Dougherty is one of the leading planetary scientists in her field. Does she think there is life on one of the icy Moons of Jupiter or Saturn?\n\"I'd be very surprised if there wasn't,\" she says, beaming with delight.\n\"Three things are required: a heat source, liquid water and organic (carbon-based) chemicals. If we have those three ingredients, the chances that life is able to form rises really steeply.\nIf simple life forms are found to exist that is no guarantee that more complex life forms are out there.\nProf Madhusudhan believes that, if confirmed, simple life should be \"pretty common\" in the galaxy. \"But going from that simple life to complex life is a big step, and that is an open question. How that step happens? What are the conditions that govern that? We don't know that. And then going from there to intelligent life is another big step.\"\nDr Robert Massey, who is the deputy executive director of the Royal Astronomical Society, agrees that the emergence of intelligent life on another world is much less likely than simple life.\n\"When we see the emergence of life on Earth, it was so complex. It took such a long time for multi-cellular life to emerge and then evolve into diverse life forms.\n\"The big question is whether there was something about the Earth that made that evolution possible. Do we need exactly the same conditions, our size, our oceans and land masses for that to happen on other worlds or will that happen regardless?\"\nHe believes that the discovery of even simple alien life would be the latest chapter in the diminution of humanity's place in the cosmos.\nAs he puts it, centuries ago, we believed we were at the centre of the Universe and with each discovery in astronomy we have found ourselves \"more displaced\" from that point. \"I think the discovery of life elsewhere it would further reduce our specialness,\" he says.\nProf Dougherty, on the other hand, believes that such a discovery in our own solar system would be good for science, and good for the soul.\n\"The discovery of even simple life will allow us a better understanding about how we might have evolved way back those millions of aeons ago when we first evolved. And so, for me, it's helping us find our place in the Universe.\n\"If we know there is life, elsewhere in our solar system and potentially beyond, [this] would somehow be comforting to me, knowing that we're a fabric of something larger will make us bigger\".\nNever before have scientists searched so hard for life on other worlds and never before have they had such incredible tools to do this with. And many working in the field believe that it is a matter of when, rather than if, they discover life on other worlds. And rather than bringing fear, the discovery of alien life will bring hope, according to Prof Madhusudhan.\n\"When we would look at the sky, we would see not just physical objects, stars and planets, we would see a living sky. The societal ramifications of that are immense. It will be a huge transformational change in the way we look at ourselves in the cosmic scene.\n\"It will fundamentally change the human psyche in how we view ourselves and each other, and any barriers, linguistic, political, geographical, will dissolve, as we realise we are all one. And that will bring us closer,\" he continues.\n\"It will be another step in our evolution\". \n Top picture credit: Getty Images\nBBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

      "content": "Near a planet far, far away, astronomers have found traces of chemicals that on Earth are only produced by living beings.\nAstronomers have found the clearest evidence yet that life might exist beyond the solar system, from the atmosphere of a planet 124 light years away from Earth, setting off rare excitement - tinged with caution - in the global scientific community.\nUsing the James Webb Space Telescope, researchers led by astronomers at the University of Cambridge in the United Kingdom have found chemical signatures of two compounds that on Earth are only produced by living creatures. \n \"These are the first hints we are seeing of an alien world that is possibly inhabited,\" Nikku Madhusudhan, an astronomy professor at Cambridge and the lead researcher behind the discovery, told reporters at a media briefing on April 15. \"This is a revolutionary moment.\"\nSo where is the planet that might possibly host life, what evidence have scientists found, and is there reason for scepticism?\nThe researchers relied on data captured by NASA's James Webb telescope, which was carried into outer space in 2022, and sits about 1.5 million kilometres (930,000 miles) away from Earth, as humanity's watchtower peering into the universe.\nThey focused on one particular planet, K2-18b, because it had already shown promising signs as a candidate extraterrestrial body with conditions similar to those on Earth.\nK2-18b lies in a constellation called Leo, and is so far away from Earth that a spaceship would need to travel for 124 years at the speed of light to get there. In reality, it would take much, much longer since the laws of physics don't allow anything other than light to travel that fast.\nThe planet is 8.6 times heavier than Earth, and 2.6 times as large. Critically, it sits in what is known as the \"Goldilocks Zone\" of its sun: that's the region around a star where a planet's temperature could, in theory, support water in its liquid form on the surface.\nIn 2023, Cambridge astronomers found methane and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere of the planet.\nThat was the first time that carbon-based molecules had been discovered in the atmosphere of any planet in the habitable zone of its sun - the distance from a sun where it's neither too hot, nor too cold, and so possible for life to survive. The scientists said that a surface covered first by an ocean, and then a hydrogen-rich atmosphere, would explain the presence of carbon-based molecules. Simply put, it was possible that the planet could have water.\nResearchers have now found much harder evidence suggesting that the planet might not only have the conditions to host life - but could, at least in theory, be hosting life itself.\nTo explore planets light years away from Earth, scientists wait for them to pass in front of their suns. They study the light from the suns as it streams through the atmospheres of these planets, searching for clues.\nThat's how the team found traces of either dimethyl sulfide (DMS) or dimethyl disulfide (DMDS) - or both - in the atmosphere of K2-18b.\nOn Earth, these compounds are only produced by living beings, particularly microbes such as marine phytoplankton. What's more, what the scientists found suggests that the concentration of these chemicals in the K2-18b atmosphere was thousands of times higher than on Earth.\n\"It was an incredible realisation seeing the results emerge and remain consistent throughout the extensive independent analyses and robustness tests,\" said co-author Mans Holmberg, a researcher at the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, United States, in a media statement on the Cambridge University website.\nThe scientists published their findings in the peer-reviewed Astrophysical Journal Letters publication, which means that other experts in the field who studied their paper found it convincing.\nBut that does not mean that the scientists have found irrefutable evidence of life. Far from it.\nMadhusudhan acknowledged that it is possible that the traces of DMS and DMDS found in the atmosphere of K2-18b are the outcome of chemical phenomena that are as of now, unknown to humanity.\n\"It's important that we're deeply sceptical of our own results, because it's only by testing and testing again that we will be able to reach the point where we're confident in them,\" Madhusudhan said. \"That's how science has to work.\"\nHis colleagues in the research team agreed.\n\"Our work is the starting point for all the investigations that are now needed to confirm and understand the implications of these exciting findings,\" said co-author Savvas Constantinou, also from Cambridge's Institute of Astronomy.\nThe findings of the Cambridge-led team follow a series of breakthroughs in recent years that have excited scientists about the possibilities of finding life beyond Earth.\nIn 2011, NASA scientists announced that they had found chemicals that are components of DNA on meteorites that had landed in Antarctica. The chemical traces they had discovered couldn't have been the result of contamination after the meteorites landed on Earth. The only explanation - that asteroids and comets could contain the building blocks of life.\nA year later, astronomers at Copenhagen University tracked down a sugar molecule in a distant star system. That molecule is an essential component of ribonucleic acid or RNA, a molecule that is critical for most biological functions.\nIn 2023, astronomers found traces of organic molecules in the gases around one of Saturn's moons, Enceladus.\nAnd in mid-2024, scientists identified five greenhouse gases that they said would be telltale signs of life on any other planet.\nBut the journey of science is also about setbacks. In 2005, two NASA scientists claimed they had found potential traces of extraterrestrial life on Mars after they discovered signs of methane there. Yet those findings eventually did not hold up to scientific scrutiny and NASA distanced itself from their conclusions.\nThe Cambridge-led team has found DMS and DMDS with 99.7 percent certainty. But while that might sound like a near-perfect score, it is far from what is accepted as the benchmark for a new discovery by the exacting standards of science.\nFor their conclusions to be considered bulletproof, they need to get to what is known as the five-sigma threshold - 99.99994 percent certainty.\nThe astronomers believe that more hours on the James Webb telescope could help them reach that level of confirmation.\n\"Decades from now, we may look back at this point in time and recognise it was when the living universe came within reach,\" said Madhusudhan. \"This could be the tipping point, where suddenly the fundamental question of whether we're alone in the universe is one we're capable of answering.\" \n Follow Al Jazeera English:",

      "content": "Scientists have found new but tentative evidence that a faraway world orbiting another star may be home to life.\nA Cambridge team studying the atmosphere of a planet called K2-18b has detected signs of molecules which on Earth are only produced by simple organisms.\nThis is the second, and more promising, time chemicals associated with life have been detected in the planet's atmosphere by Nasa's James Webb Space Telescope (JWST).\nBut the team and independent astronomers stress that more data is needed to confirm these results.\nThe lead researcher, Prof Nikku Madhusudhan, told me at his lab at Cambridge University's Institute of Astronomy that he hopes to obtain the clinching evidence soon.\n\"This is the strongest evidence yet there is possibly life out there. I can realistically say that we can confirm this signal within one to two years.\"\nK2-18b is two-and-a-half times the size of Earth and is 700 trillion miles, or 124 light years, away from us - a distance far beyond what any human could travel in a lifetime.\nJWST is so powerful that it can analyse the chemical composition of the planet's atmosphere from the light that passes through from the small red Sun it orbits.\nThe Cambridge group has found that the atmosphere seems to contain the chemical signature of at least one of two molecules that are associated with life: dimethyl sulphide (DMS) and dimethyl disulphide (DMDS). On Earth, these gases are produced by marine phytoplankton and bacteria.\nProf Madhusudhan said he was surprised by how much gas was apparently detected during a single observation window.\n\"The amount we estimate of this gas in the atmosphere is thousands of times higher than what we have on Earth,\" he said.\n\"So, if the association with life is real, then this planet will be teeming with life,\" he added.\nProf Madhusudhan went further: \"If we confirm that there is life on K2-18b, it should basically confirm that life is very common in the galaxy.\"\nHe told BBC Radio 5Live on Thursday: \"This is a very important moment in science, but also very important to us as a species.\n\"If there is one example, and the universe being infinite, there is a chance for life on many more planets.\"\nDr Subir Sarkar, a lecturer in astrophysics at Cardiff University and part of the research team, said the research suggests K2-18b could have an ocean which could be potentially full of life - though he cautioned scientists \"don't know for sure\".\nHe added that the research team's work will continue to focus on looking for life on other planets: \"Keep watching this space.\"\nThere are lots of \"ifs\" and \"buts\" at this stage, as Prof Madhusudhan's team freely admits.\nFirstly, this latest detection is not at the standard required to claim a discovery. \nFor that, the researchers need to be about 99.99999% sure that their results are correct and not a fluke reading. In scientific jargon, that is a five sigma result. \nThese latest results are only three sigma, or 99.7%. Which sounds like a lot, but it is not enough to convince the scientific community. However, it is much more than the one sigma result of 68% the team obtained 18 months ago, which was greeted with much scepticism at the time.\nBut even if the Cambridge team obtains a five sigma result, that won't be conclusive proof that life exists on the planet, according to Prof Catherine Heymans of Edinburgh University and Scotland's Astronomer Royal, who is independent of the research team.\n\"Even with that certainty, there is still the question of what is the origin of this gas,\" she told BBC News.\n\"On Earth it is produced by microorganisms in the ocean, but even with perfect data we can't say for sure that this is of a biological origin on an alien world because loads of strange things happen in the Universe and we don't know what other geological activity could be happening on this planet that might produce the molecules.\"\nThat view is one the Cambridge team agree with. They are working with other groups to see if DMS and DMDS can be produced by non-living means in the lab.\n\"There is still a 0.3% chance that it might be a statistical fluke,\" Prof Madhusudhan said.\nSuggesting life may exist on another planet was \"a big claim if true\", he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme, adding: \"So we want to be really, really thorough, and make more observations, and get the evidence to the level that there is less than a one-in-a-million chance of it being a fluke.\"\nHe said this should be possible in \"maybe one or two years\".\nOther research groups have put forward alternative, lifeless, explanations for the data obtained from K2-18b. There is a strong scientific debate not only about whether DMS and DMDS are present but also the planet's composition.\nThe reason many researchers infer that the planet has a vast liquid ocean is the absence of the gas ammonia in K2-18b's atmosphere. Their theory is that the ammonia is absorbed by a vast body of water below. \nBut it could equally be explained by an ocean of molten rock, which would preclude life, according to Prof Oliver Shorttle of Cambridge University.\n\"Everything we know about planets orbiting other stars comes from the tiny amounts of light that glance off their atmospheres. So it is an incredibly tenuous signal that we are having to read, not only for signs of life, but everything else,\" he said.\n\"With K2-18b part of the scientific debate is still about the structure of the planet.\"\nDr Nicolas Wogan at Nasa's Ames Research Center has yet another interpretation of the data. He published research suggesting that K2-18b is a mini gas giant with no surface. \nBoth these alternative interpretations have also been challenged by other groups on the grounds that they are inconsistent with the data from JWST, compounding the strong scientific debate surrounding K2-18b.\nProf Chris Lintott, presenter of the BBC's The Sky at Night, said he had \"great admiration\" for Prof Madhusudhan's team, but was treating the research with caution.\n\"I think we've got to be very careful about claiming that this is 'a moment' on the search to life. We've [had] such moments before,\" he told Today.\nHe said the research should be seen instead as \"part of a huge effort to try and understand what's out there in the cosmos\".\nProf Madhusudhan acknowledges that there is still a scientific mountain to climb if he is to answer one of the biggest questions in science. But he believes he and his team are on the right track.\n\"Decades from now, we may look back at this point in time and recognise it was when the living universe came within reach,\" he said.\n\"This could be the tipping point, where suddenly the fundamental question of whether we're alone in the universe is one we're capable of answering.\"\nThe research has been published in The Astrophysical Journal Letters.\nGet our flagship newsletter with all the headlines you need to start the day.

      "content": "The leaders of Canada's four major federal parties have been grilled about their response to US President Donald Trump and clashed over energy and housing in their first televised debate of the country's election campaign.\nThe French-language face-off marked a key moment in the election as it gave leaders a chance to woo voters in the seat-rich province of Quebec. \nIt was also a big test for Liberal leader Mark Carney, who has a slight lead in the polls, but whose French is the weakest among the federal leaders. He at times struggled to articulate his points on stage.\nThere is a second debate in English on Thursday, before Canadians vote on 28 April. \nOn the stage were the four main party candidates: Liberal leader and current Prime Minister Carney, Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre, Bloc Quebecois leader Yves-Francois Blanchet, and leader of the New Democratic Party (NDP), Jagmeet Singh. \nThe debate was moderated by Radio-Canada journalist Patrice Roy. \nMr Roy opened the forum saying that Canada's short 36-day federal election had been \"hijacked by Trump\", and asked each leader to outline two campaign promises unrelated to the US or its tariffs.\nBut soon afterwards, Mr Roy plunged into a question on how each party would handle the trade war with the US, calling it the \"elephant in the room\". \nTrump has implemented blanket 25% tariffs on goods from Canada, with an exemption on products covered by the USMCA - a North American free trade deal. Canada is also hit with global US tariffs on steel and aluminium and cars. \nThe president has also publicly mused about Canada becoming the 51st US state. \nPoilievre, of the opposition Conservatives, accused the governing Liberals of weakening the country over the past decade, making Canada more vulnerable to economic threats.\nCarney touted his experience as a former central banker for both Canada and the UK, as well as his time in the private sector.\n\"[Trump] respects people who understand the world and how the private sector works,\" Carney said. \nSingh, of the left-leaning NDP, sought to paint both Poilievre and Carney as the wrong option for Canadians whose jobs may be affected by US tariffs.\n\"Both will cut taxes for millionaires and billionaires,\" he said.\nFor Carney, the French-language debate was arguably the first major test of the campaign trail. \nA second debate will be held on Thursday night with the contenders speaking in English.\nThat forum will be more widely watched nationwide, but the stakes were high on Wednesday for Carney's Liberals, which are leading in Quebec where the majority of French-speaking Canadians live.\nHis French was the weakest on stage, and he often kept his answers brief and sometimes struggled to get his points across in a debate format with opportunities for rapid exchanges.\nHe also faced the most frequent attacks as the others leaders tried to tie him to the Liberal record of former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who resigned last month. \n\"We are still talking about the same party, the same caucus,\" the Bloc's Blanchet said. \nHe added: \"It's not because you change the leader that you change your philosophy.\"\nCarney countered that he had accomplishments despite only being sworn in as PM last month. He had \"just arrived\", he said. \nThere was a moment of levity when Mr Roy asked the leaders if they were buying fewer US products - like many Canadians are in the face of tariffs - at the grocery store. \nCarney had admitted in an interview early this month that he does not do his own groceries when asked if he still buys US strawberries. \nSingh and Blanchet both said they bought Canadian berries. Carney said he had given up US wine, while Poilievre said he buys Canadian beef. \nTrump was not the only issue on the agenda. The leaders were asked about their plan to address Canada's housing crisis, and how they would balance climate and the economy.\nOn housing, Poilievre vowed to cut taxes and red tape that he says act as a barrier to home building. \n\"We don't need more bureaucracy, we need more front doors,\" the Conservative leader said in a jab directed at Carney. \nBut the two found common ground on energy, saying the country should ramp up its oil and gas production. \nCarney said climate remains a priority for his party, adding that he would focus on producing \"low-risk\", \"low-carbon\" oil. \nOn immigration, there was also wide agreement that Canada must look at its capacity to integrate newcomers and asylum seekers. \nCanada has seen a rapid population boom in recent years and social and housing infrastructure has struggled to catch up.\nCanadian border officials recently noted an uptick in asylum seekers looking to cross the Quebec-US border as a result of the Trump administration's hardline immigration policies.\nAbsent from the debate stage was the Green Party. In a last-minute decision by the debate commission, it was disqualified for failing to meet the criteria by not endorsing candidates in at least 90% of Canada's federal ridings, or constituencies. \nThe party, which had two MPs in parliament when the election was called, also failed to meet the threshold of at least 4% in national support. \nGreen Party co-leader Jonathan Pedneault called the commission's decision \"baseless\" and \"undemocratic\". \nIt wasn't the only change to the debate. \nOn Tuesday, the start time was officially moved forward by two hours to accommodate an NHL game between the Montreal Canadiens and the Carolina Hurricanes, with a spot in the Stanley Cup play-offs at stake.\nCanadian Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre is seeking to bring the Liberal Party's nine years in power to an end. \nThe former banker may not have been elected to office before, but is now seeking a mandate from Canadians. \nCanadians will vote on April 28. Here is a breakdown of who could be the country's next prime minister.\nCanada is holding a national election amid growing tension with the US over trade and tariffs.\nTariffs are a key part of the US president's political vision but economists fear a global trade war.\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

The majority of Canada's about 10 million French speakers live in the province of Quebec, where the team is based.\nHere were the top takeaways from Wednesday's debate:\nIn just under three months in office, US President Donald Trump has undertaken one of the most significant shifts in US relations with Canada in history.\nHis actions have included imposing wide-ranging tariffs on the northern neighbour and, in an unprecedented threat of annexation, repeatedly suggesting making Canada the \"51st\" state.\nOn Wednesday, Carney, whose Liberal party has seen surging support in the face of Trump's threats, sought to centre the US president, saying the election is about \"who will face up to Trump\". \n \"In a crisis, you have to have a plan,\" said Carney, who spent the night pushing his economic bonafides, which included leading the Bank of Canada and the Bank of England\nPoilievre, who in the past has been likened to a Canadian \"mini Trump\", pledged to negotiate a deal that would bring down tariffs, while saying he would protect Canadian sovereignty.\n\"We will never be an American state,\" he said.\nBloc Quebecois leader Blanchet, meanwhile, accused Carney of failing to protect Quebec in his early response to Trump.\n\"So far, all we have seen is efforts being deployed to protect the Ontario economy, which is the way Canada defines itself,\" he said.\nFor Poilievre, who for months had a commanding polling lead over the Liberals, sought to drive home one unifying theme: That Canadians want change after nine and a half years of a Liberal government, led mostly by Justin Trudeau.\nPoilievre said Carney was repeating the same promises Trudeau had made during his time in power and accused his party of driving up housing prices and weakening the economy by blocking natural resource development. \n Carney shot back that he was leading the Bank of England from 2013 to 2019, as he sought to distance himself from the Liberals' policies during that period.\n\"You are just like Justin Trudeau ... we need change and you, Mr Carney, are not change,\" Poilievre told Carney.\n\"Mr Poilievre is not Mr Trudeau and neither am I,\" Carney shot back.\nPoilievre also took particular aim at the Liberals' immigration policies.\nTrudeau had boosted visas to work in Canada to address labour shortages after the COVID-19 pandemic, but cut those caps dramatically last year as critics seized on the country's rapid population growth.\nThe Conservative candidate said liberals allowed immigration to \"spiral out of control\".\nCarney also sought to differentiate himself from the Liberals' past policies, saying the \"system isn't working, especially after the pandemic\". He said he supported keeping the lowered caps in place for the time being.\nPoilievre added he would block those seeking safety from violence-wracked Haiti, while Carney said he supported temporary caps on asylum seekers.\n\"We have to be human, but we have to be realistic. Canada can't accept everyone,\" he said.\nMeanwhile, the New Democratic Party's Singh said that in light of Trump's crackdown on refugees and asylum seekers, Canada should end its \"Safe Third Party\" agreement with the US. The agreement allows Canada to turn back asylum seekers who enter from the US.\n\"We're talking about a dangerous situation, and we should respond with compassion,\" Singh said.\nThe economic uncertainty spurred by Trump's tariffs has also brought renewed focus on Canada's energy policy.\nHailing from the country's oil capital, Alberta, Poilievre has long pushed for deregulation and boosting oil production. On Wednesday, he promised to surge oil production through more oil pipelines.\nCarney also signalled a willingness to boost oil production through pipelines, but said approval would be needed from both Quebec and Indigenous groups, as is required under law.\n\"This is Canada. That's how Canada works,\" Carney said. Still, upon being pressed, he said the environment remained a Liberal priority.\nBloc Quebecois leader Blanchet accused both the Liberal and Conservative leaders of ignoring the ravages of climate change.\n\"The denial of the reality of climate change since the beginning of this campaign and the change of heart of Mr Carney, who decided to be more conservative than Mr Poilievre, is very harmful for our environment,\" Blanchet said.\nCarney, the only candidate on stage lacking a strong grasp of the French language, generally managed to hold his own throughout the debate and avoid any major faux pas.\nStill, the issue of language rights and preservation featured prominently, including discussion of Bill 96, a sweeping 2022 reform to Quebec's law that limited the use of English in some government services and courts.\nThe law has been challenged by non-French-speaking groups in the province, and remains a delicate subject for candidates seeking to win support in Quebec.\nPoilievre said he \"will continue to support laws and policies that allow Quebec and the federal government to protect the French language all across Canada\".\nCarney was more circumspect, saying, \"The question is, do we have rights and freedoms here in Canada? Are we equal?\"\n\"We need to consider the right balance.\"\nCarney also pledged that the Liberal government would seek to bolster the declining French-speaking population in Canada by increasing the rate of francophone immigrants to provinces outside of Quebec from 10 to 12 percent. \n Follow Al Jazeera English:",

      "content": "Abolishing tariffs would be welcome, but not at the price of reducing high regulatory standards or a reset with the European Union\nLooked at objectively, a bilateral trade agreement between Britain and the United States is of relatively small economic significance to this country. Back in 2020, Boris Johnson's government estimated that a US deal \"could increase UK GDP in the long run by around 0.07%\" - a figure that is not exactly transformative. The view touted by some Brexiters that a US trade deal would fire up the entire British economy was always a fantasy, the product of deregulatory yearning for which there was little public support, even among leave voters. Any urge of that kind is clearly even more delusional now, in the wake of Donald Trump's tariff wars.\nHopefully, the right's across-the-board deregulatory horror is now a thing of the past. But global trade has new traumas too. Mr Trump's protectionism and bullying of US rivals are resetting the terms. There are nevertheless specific reasons why it is in Britain's interest to pursue freer trade talks with the US. Chief among these is the threat posed by current tariffs, especially on cars and pharmaceuticals, as well as the prospect that a 10% tariff will be reimposed on all UK exports to the US after the current pause ends in July.\nThe problem with any deal lies with the prices that the US may try to extract for tariff reductions or exemptions. Although the vice-president, JD Vance, said this week that he sees a \"good chance\" of a deal, this could still be contingent on UK concessions in sectors such as agriculture, sanitary and phytosanitary rules and digital regulation. These are essentially the same sectors that, for good reason, proved to be stumbling blocks in the post-Brexit discussions. Efforts to rebrand things like AI, biotech and digital as strategically important industries of the future do not dispel some real threats now facing British food standards, healthcare or online controls.\nAll this is multiplied by the Trump administration's unreliability and geostrategic approach. The administration's goal in Europe is to weaken and destroy the EU. Urged on by rightwing Brexiter politicians, the president sees pulling Britain away from the EU's orbit as part of that effort. So, however, does the EU. As a result, any attempt by Washington to offer generous terms to the UK in particular sectors is likely to make any reset with the EU more difficult. Sir Keir Starmer says that Britain does not need to make an either/or choice. Like Mr Johnson, he says Britain can have its cake and eat it. The brutal reality is that neither the US nor the EU will necessarily take the same generous view.\nEven if the prospective UK-US deal is less wide-ranging than it might once have been, it is still significant. Politically, the Trump factor also makes any such deal more explosive. UK treaties and trade deals are traditionally made under prerogative powers. As the Brexit argument about a \"meaningful vote\" showed, there is a very limited role for parliament. That needs to change. It would be intolerable in the UK-US case. This is clearly a matter for parliament to debate, both during and after negotiations, and for both houses of parliament to vote on.\nThis week, the Labour chairs of the Commons foreign affairs and trade select committees called for such votes. The Liberal Democrats and the Scottish National party are both in favour. The government should make clear that no agreement will go ahead without a meaningful Commons vote in favour.",
      "ml_hf_summary": "A bilateral trade agreement between Britain and the United States is of limited economic significance, with potential benefits estimated at 0.07% increase to UK GDP.  The article highlights the impact of tariffs imposed by the Trump administration on trade between the two countries, particularly on cars and pharmaceuticals. While a deal could offer tariff reductions or exemptions, it may require concessions in sectors like agriculture, sanitary regulations, and digital regulation, similar to those that hindered post-Brexit negotiations. The US administration's focus on weakening the EU further complicates any reset with the bloc, potentially impacting trade negotiations.  The article emphasizes the need for parliamentary involvement in any agreement, as traditional UK treaty making relies on prerogative powers, requiring a meaningful vote from parliament before proceeding. \n"

      "content": "UK politicians and industry have options if they want steel to make money while minimising emissions\nThe government has taken control of British Steel, so averting the closure within days of the UK's last two blast furnaces. However, the takeover leaves a big question: what next?\nSteep losses at British Steel prompted its Chinese owner, Jingye, to decide last month to close its blast furnaces in Scunthorpe, Lincolnshire, which would end the production of \"virgin\" steel in the UK. The government stepped in with emergency legislation, passed in a single day last Saturday, to prevent that.\nThe legislation has given the industry, workers and politicians time to work out how to build a doubly sustainable UK steel industry: one that makes money, while minimising carbon emissions.\nThe future for Scunthorpe, if it is to have a future, will almost certainly be the electric arc furnace (EAF). Blast furnaces use coal to strip oxygen from iron ore to make iron, which is then refined into steel. The oxygen combines with carbon, eventually to be vented into the atmosphere as planet-heating carbon dioxide. By contrast, EAFs use electricity to melt down scrap steel sourced from old cars and demolished buildings.\nThe Celsa steelworks in Cardiff is one such factory, using high-voltage electrical currents that generate the 1,600C needed to turn scrap metal to liquid.\nThat route to decarbonisation has already been chosen by Tata Steel at Port Talbot in south Wales: it closed its two blast furnaces last year to make way for electric arc replacements.\nDan Marks, a research fellow who has studied steel at the Royal United Services Institute (Rusi), a defence thinktank, said the shift to electric arc furnaces was inevitable, but that successive governments had taken too long to act.\n\"This was something that needed to be done in 2019,\" said Marks. Back then it was clear that only a few years remained for the four operating blast furnaces at Port Talbot and Scunthorpe. \"Nobody is going to invest in blast furnaces over a 25- to 30-year commitment,\" he said.\nFor Charlotte Brumpton-Childs, national officer for the GMB union, the priority is preserving good jobs for the workers of Scunthorpe, where she used to work. To that end, she said the government should consider electric arc furnaces but should also look at using methane or hydrogen in blast furnaces. That technology, which already exists, would cut emissions and would have the advantage from the unions' point of view of minimising disruption for the workforce at Scunthorpe, although it appears to be a long shot.\nMuch lower carbon is a key attraction, but the other side of sustainability is financial.\nFrank Aaskov, director for energy and climate change policy at UK Steel, welcomed the government's action on Scunthorpe. However, he said: \"The UK steel industry needs an improved business framework, which requires significant changes to trade, energy, scrap, and procurement policies, which have held the industry back.\"\nAsk pretty much any UK steel industry executive what they want from government and the answer is the same: cheaper energy. UK companies will pay about PS68 a megawatt hour (MWh) for electricity this year, compared with PS44 in France and PS52 in Germany, according to the consultancy Baringa. Prices in Sweden, which has abundant cheap hydropower, can be less than a third those of the UK.\nThe government has already committed to a big increase in renewables such as wind and solar to wean power generation off fossil gas. However, those promises may not provide much help for a few years yet.\nLiam Bates, the president of long products at the Sheffield-based stainless steelmaker Marcegaglia, said: \"The real ask is to have green electricity at a price similar to the rest of Europe. It's that simple.\"\nIt could be relatively simple: UK Steel, the industry lobby group, has argued that it could cost less than 50p a year for each household to match France's cheaper electricity for steel. However, the subsidies suggested could force the government to pay more if gas prices surge, pushing up the price of electricity.\nGovernment policy on the steel industry has been pulled between the desire for a free market and state control for most of the past century. Clement Attlee's Labour government nationalised the steel industry in 1949, and then the Conservatives privatised it in 1951. Labour renationalised it in 1967 and Margaret Thatcher privatised it in 1988.\nMany people in the steel industry argue that it has never really been a free market. Too many governments tip the scales to support strategic industries. Now that the free market is in retreat around the world, thanks in part to Donald Trump's tariffs, the steel industry insists that protectionism is necessary for the UK industry to survive.\nQuotas set in response to Trump's first-term tariffs are now bigger than demand, leaving them out of date, said one senior UK steel executive. British companies allege that foreign rivals are dumping steel in the UK in their desperation to find a buyer. The industry wants the UK government to react to trade distortions sooner.\n\"We need to be quicker,\" said the executive. \"We're suffering a serious diversion of trade from EU and other countries, and prices no longer follow EU levels as has been the norm for many years.\"\nIt is not all bad for the UK steel industry. Companies are relieved that the Labour government has stuck by a pledge to spend PS2.5bn to help the industry, even as other parts of the budget, such as international aid and welfare spending, have been cut.\nHow that money is spent is still up for grabs. The government could be tempted by eye-catching investments as monuments to their support.\nAlasdair McDiarmid, assistant general secretary at Community, another union representing steelworkers, called for two big projects backed by the UK government. The first would be a large plate mill that would be capable of making the steel needed for wind turbine towers needed for the government's expansion of green energy. Only 2% of the steel used in British offshore wind projects over the past five years was made in the UK, according to Lumen Energy & Environment, a consultancy.\nIf that proportion does not rise then the UK will miss out on up to 2m tonnes of demand at the peak. The government is thought to be prepared to pay higher prices for British steel if it supports jobs in the UK, a consideration that will also inform the planned defence spending boom.\nThe second big investment would be a factory making direct reduced iron (DRI). That would use methane and then, ideally, hydrogen made with clean electricity, to produce iron from iron ore, thereby almost eliminating the need for coal in virgin steel production.\nDRI plants already produce millions of tonnes a year using methane, with India the biggest producer of lumps of iron known as hot briquetted iron.\nThe unions may be pushing at an open door. The government has made clear that it is seriously considering DRI. It has received a report on the technology by the Middlesbrough-based Materials Processing Institute, formerly a research arm of Tata Steel, and ministers have talked of DRI's potential for several years.\nJonathan Reynolds, the business secretary, told parliament on Saturday: \"I believe that the capacity for primary steel production is important. Direct reduced iron technology is of significant potential interest to us for the future.\"\nWhat that would look like is unclear, however. None of the major steel companies in the UK has expressed a desire to run a DRI plant, despite government waving the possibility of huge subsidies. A person with knowledge of the government's thinking said it was likely that a commercial partner would be sought to build a DRI plant, if recommended in a study by the Materials Processing Institute.\nHowever, Rusi's Marks argued that the focus on making virgin steel from iron ore is misplaced. Preserving British primary steelmaking is popular across the House of Commons, but Marks pointed out that in an extreme wartime scenario the UK would still be dependent on imports (of iron ore from Australia or Brazil).\nMarks said he believed that the ability to make different kinds of product in a pinch was more important: flat steels, or long products, aerospace-grade or speciality steels for nuclear submarine reactors. For instance, during the Covid-19 pandemic Tata Steel had to work flat out to produce food cans. Without that existing ability, there might have been shortages of some food products during the crisis.\nThe government may have to pay more attention to the unglamorous world of scrap yards, and preventing the export of the valuable metal. The UK produces between 10m and 11m tonnes of scrap every year, most of which is exported to places such as Turkey to be sorted and recycled. That metal would provide more than enough to replace the UK's 5.6m tonnes of steel produced in 2023.\n\"Worrying about whether your steel is recycled or not is pointless,\" said Marks. \"The question is: is your supply secure?\"",
      "ml_hf_summary": "British Steel, facing financial losses and closure threats, was taken over by the government to prevent a shutdown. The government's intervention has given time for the industry to develop a sustainable model that generates profits while minimizing emissions.  Electric arc furnaces (EAF) are being promoted as a key technology for achieving this goal. \n\nThe UK steel industry is facing challenges from global trade distortions and competition, leading to calls for protectionist measures like import quotas. The government has pledged financial support for the industry through projects like a large plate mill and a direct reduced iron (DRI) plant.  However, the future of DRI remains uncertain as major steel companies haven't expressed interest in building such plants. \n\nThe UK also faces challenges with scrap metal recycling, which could be used to replace domestic production. The government is exploring ways to secure domestic supply chains and ensure a stable future for the industry. \n"

This decline is attributed to high costs and unpredictable weather conditions. The Welsh government's statistics show a decrease in tourist arrivals since April, with many businesses facing financial challenges due to the impact of the weather.  The study also highlights that 38% of businesses have taken steps to prepare for potential economic difficulties in the coming years. Despite these challenges, tourism experts remain optimistic about the future and believe that the industry will bounce back once the weather improves. \n"

We hope Omer will reflect on his ill-judged comments.\"\nRiza maintains he is 'right person' to keep Cardiff up\nCardiff boss Riza calls for fans' 'help'\nRiza deserves more from board and players - Perry\nSupporters had been audibly frustrated at Cardiff's most recent defeat, a 1-0 home loss to survival race rivals Stoke City last weekend.\nWith the Welsh club one point from safety - and inferior goal difference to many sides around them - Riza said he was aware of the severity of the situation and was ready to accept responsibility.\nComments regarding fans came following a question over the personal toll the pressures have taken on him during his first permanent senior management position, having replaced Erol Bulut in the Bluebirds dug out in September.\n\"It's something I need to be better at,\" he said. \"I've got a family. I can be obsessed with the situation and knowing the importance of it and sometimes you can neglect your family, and ignore them at times. Then you reflect and think that shouldn't happen and as a young manager it's something I need to get better at.\n\"I know how important it is. It's a failure on my part if we go down. I have standards, I have goals, ideas about where I feel I can take this club.\n\"I do read comments, I read all the comments from fans and unfortunately a lot of them are clueless.\n\"That's what I've got to learn, I've got to learn to come away from that side of things so I can stay focused on what I am doing - because there are lot of good people out there, around the club, a lot of good fans and we've got to do this together. \"\nOmer Riza has won nine, drawn 14 and lost 13 Championship games since replacing Erol Bulut as Cardiff City manager in September 2024\nIt is the not the first time supporters have picked up on comments from Riza, a subject he had addressed earlier in the press conference where he admitted he had tried to be more cautious with what he said.\nThe former Watford coach had previously described Cardiff's remaining games as cup finals, something he suggested had been mocked by some critics among the fanbase.\n\"That got turned into a joke - but this isn't the time for jokes or for people to take the mick out of the situation,\" he said.\n\"For me that's painful because it seems like any opportunity for people to latch onto something that is supposed to be a positive and turn it into a negative, that's not a togetherness.\n\"Whether it's a manager making mistakes, a player or some of the fans are disgruntled, it's about everyone pulling together.\n\"Every press conference I have, maybe a sentence is turned into something it shouldn't be and that's disappointing for me.

It also applies to pet food.\nIn addition, milk and dairy products - like butter, cheese and yoghurt - from the EU have also been prohibited. \nIt covers items such as sandwiches and cured meats as well as raw meats and milk \"regardless of whether it is packed or packaged or whether it has been bought at duty free\".\nHowever, there are exceptions such as chicken, duck, goose and any other products made from these.\nThe measure is only directed at people arriving in Great Britain - as in, England, Wales or Scotland - from the EU.\nIt does not apply to Northern Ireland, which has its own measures in place to contain foot and mouth disease.\nThe ban covers anyone travelling by any mode of transport - whether that's by plane, train, bus or by car.\nBut it will not be imposed on those arriving to Great Britain from Northern Ireland, Jersey, Guernsey, or the Isle of Man.\nThe ban only applies to travellers bringing in items personally - not commercial importers such as farmers or shops.\nThe reason, according to the UK government, is that commercial meat and cheese imports face higher standards than individuals are subjected to.\nThey must go through heat treatment, which is meant to kill germs, and come with health certificates signed by vets.\nThe disease typically spreads between animals through direct contact. But they can also catch it by eating contaminated meat or dairy products.\nAny products of animal origin, like meat and dairy, could be contaminated with foot and mouth disease.\nEven if they are for human consumption, if they are thrown away in a way that could come into contact with foraging wildlife or domestic livestock, that presents a risk.\nFoot and mouth disease is harmless to humans and there are no cases in the UK - but it is highly contagious for animals.\nIt affects cattle, sheep, pigs and, according to the government, \"other cloven-hoofed animals such as wild boar, deer, llamas and alpacas\".\nAnimals that catch it typically come down with a high temperature before developing blisters, usually around the mouth or feet. It can make animals lame and, for the very young, result in fatalities. \nThe Department for Environment, Food, and Rural Affairs introduced the measure on Saturday, 12 April and did not give an end date.\nThe BBC understands the ban will stay in place until the government believes there is no significant risk from travellers bringing banned meat and dairy into Great Britain.\nThe government put out a release last Friday ahead of the ban coming into force on Saturday.\nIt told border control and airlines to make passengers aware of the rules and has rolled out a digital and social media campaign.\nEurostar has also been sending out emails to passengers letting them know about the UK rules.\nHowever, many people who have travelled from the EU to Great Britain since the weekend told the BBC they were unaware of the measure and were not told - with no signs in the airport and no checks carried out.\nAnyone travelling should follow the rules.\nThe government says items could be seized and destroyed at the border and, in serious cases, offenders could be fined up to PS5,000 in England.\nNo, travellers are not normally allowed to bring meat and milk products into the EU from the UK for personal use. \nThis has nothing to do with the latest announcement though - it has been the case since Brexit, with the UK facing the same rules as every other non-EU country.\nBut there is an exemption for powdered baby milk, baby food, or special foods for humans or animals where there is a medical need.\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

It blamed Hamas for refusing to extend the first phase of the ceasefire, while Hamas accused Israel of reneging on its commitment to hold talks on the second stage.\nThe Board president accused Hamas of rejecting the latest ceasefire proposal, saying: \"Given that Hamas just this week rejected yet another mediation put forward via Egypt, which would have required the terrorist group to disarm, I am simply unable to agree with the viewpoint aired in the FT letter which lays blame squarely on the Israeli Government. \n\"I am confident that the vast majority of Deputies and the Jewish community as a whole agree with me.\"\nHe added that he believed the signatories of the open letter \"have a strong and completely genuine concern for the situation in Israel and Gaza\".\nMr Rosenberg also visited Israel on Thursday, where he met Israel's Minister of Foreign Affairs Gideon Saar.\nIn a post on social media, featuring a picture of the two shaking hands, Mr Rosenberg wrote: \"@BoardofDeputies is clear: Jewish leadership is standing up for peace & security in Israel & the Middle East:\n\"Getting hostages out, defeating Hamas, pursuing lasting peace & security.\n\"Unity is strength. Division serves only our enemies.\"\nIn Wednesday's open letter, signatories took aim at the Israeli government, warning \"Israel's soul is being ripped out\".\nThe letter accused Israel's government of choosing to \"break the ceasefire and return to war in Gaza\", rather than engage in diplomacy and agree the next phase of a ceasefire deal.\nIsrael blocked the entry of food, medicine and other supplies on 2 March, a day after the first phase of the ceasefire expired, saying it did so to pressure Hamas. It resumed the war two weeks later.\nIsrael launched its military campaign after Hamas carried out an unprecedented attack on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.\nAt least 51,065 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. Of that number, 1,691 have been killed since Israel restarted the war, it says.\nThe group says it lost communication after an Israeli strike on where Edan Alexander was being held.\nThe plan also gives no commitment to end the war in return for hostages, a Palestinian official says.\nThe agency says it is seeing \"attack after attack\" and supply shortages following an Israeli strike on al-Ahli hospital.\nAsaad al-Nassasra has been missing since Israeli troops killed 15 other emergency workers in south Gaza three weeks ago.\nDonald Trump has suggested Iran could face military action if it does not agree to a new nuclear deal. \nCopyright 2025 BBC.

So I don't understand what he's talking about,\" said Zelensky.\nIn his interview with Fox News, Witkoff said: \"This peace deal is about these so-called five territories. But there's so much more to it... I think we might be on the verge of something that would be very important for the world at large.\"\n\"On top of that, I believe there's a possibility to reshape the Russian-United States relationship through some very compelling commercial opportunities that I think give real stability to the region too,\" he added.\nThe US and Russia have been holding talks aimed at restoring diplomatic relations.\nZelensky's intervention is not the first time he has criticised Witkoff.\nIn March, he said: \"He doesn't look like a military man. He doesn't look like a general, and he doesn't have such experience. As far as I know, he is very good at selling and buying real estate. And this is a little different.\"\nThe Ukrainian leader's comments came after top US, Ukrainian and European diplomats met in Paris to discuss the war - a group that included Witkoff and US Secretary of State Marco Rubio.\nMeanwhile Donald Trump renewed his own criticisms of Zelensky on Thursday. He appeared to row back on earlier comments accusing the Ukrainian leader of starting the war but said he was \"not a big fan\".\n\"I don't hold Zelensky responsible but I'm not exactly thrilled with the fact that that war started,\" Trump said. \n\"I'm not blaming him, but what I am saying is that I wouldn't say he's done the greatest job, OK? I am not a big fan.\"\nZelensky also told journalists that he had \"information\" China was supplying weapons to Russia.\n\"We have finally received information that China is supplying weapons to the Russian Federation,\" he said. \n\"We believe that Chinese representatives are engaged in the production of some weapons on Russian territory,\" he added.\nChina has not yet responded but has previously portrayed itself as a neutral party in the war.\nBeijing did respond to an assertion last week by Zelensky that Chinese nationals were fighting for Russia by advising \"relevant parties to correctly and soberly understand China's role and not to make irresponsible remarks\".\nLt Gen Vadim Shamarin was sentenced to seven years in a penal colony after being accused of taking bribes.\nThe US president apportioned blame to Ukraine's leader hours after the deadliest strike on civilians this year.\nHow are Russia and Ukraine placed after three years of fighting and with Donald Trump pushing for a negotiated settlement to halt the war.\nA Russian missile killed 34 people on Sunday in an attack that Trump described as \"a mistake\" and Germany called \"a war crime\".\nThe BBC's James Waterhouse describes the scene of a Russian strike that has killed at least 34 people.\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

Jenniffer Gonzalez, who cut her weeklong vacation short and returned to Puerto Rico Wednesday evening. \nThe blackout snarled traffic, forced hundreds of businesses to close and left those unable to afford generators scrambling to buy ice and candles. \nIt's the second island-wide blackout to hit Puerto Rico in less than four months, with the previous one occurring on New Year's Eve. \n\"Why on holidays?\" griped Jose Luis Richardson, who didn't have a generator and kept cool by splashing water on himself every couple of hours.\nThe roar of generators and smell of fumes filled the air as a growing number of Puerto Ricans renewed calls for the government to cancel the contracts with Luma Energy, which oversees the transmission and distribution of power, and Genera PR, which oversees generation. \nGonzalez promised to heed those calls. \n\"That is not under doubt or question,\" she said, but added that it's not a quick process. \"It is unacceptable that we have failures of this kind.\" \nGonzalez said a major outage like the one that occurred Wednesday leads to an estimated $230 million revenue loss daily. \nRamon C. Barquin III, president of the United Retail Center, a nonprofit that represents small- and medium-sized businesses, warned that ongoing outages would spook potential investors at a time that Puerto Rico urgently needs economic development. \n\"We cannot continue to repeat this cycle of blackouts without taking concrete measures to strengthen our energy infrastructure,\" he said. \nMany also were concerned about Puerto Rico's elderly population, with the mayor of Canovanas deploying brigades to visit the bedridden and those who depend on electronic medical equipment. \nMeanwhile, the mayor of Vega Alta opened a center to provide power to those with lifesaving medical equipment.\nIt wasn't immediately clear what caused the shutdown, the latest in a string of major blackouts on the island in recent years. \nDaniel Hernandez, vice president of operations at Genera PR, said Wednesday that a disturbance hit the transmission system shortly after noon, a time when the grid is vulnerable because there are few machines regulating frequency at that hour. \nThe island's grid has been deteriorating as a result of decades of a lack of maintenance and investment.\nPuerto Rico has struggled with chronic outages since September 2017 when Hurricane Maria pummeled the island as a powerful Category 4 storm, razing a power grid that crews are still struggling to rebuild. As the island was just starting to rebuild, it was hit hard again by Hurricane Fiona in 2022.\nThe island of 3.2 million residents has a more than 40% poverty rate, and not everyone can afford solar panels or generators. While there was a push to use more renewable energy sources under the administration of former President Joe Biden, which provided Puerto Rico with mega generators and other resources, experts worry that won't happen under President Trump. \n (c) 2025 CBS Interactive Inc.

(FOX NEWS DIGITAL)\nRyan Enos, a Harvard professor of government, said he was glad that his employer opposed the government's demands. \n\"You shouldn't have the government coming in and telling a private institution what it can do in its internal affairs like that,\" he said.\nEnos also commented on antisemitism on campus, stating that while he hasn't seen antisemitism directly, he believes there's a difference between anti-Jewish sentiment and protesting a war. \n\"People have a right to protest whatever they want,\" Enos said. \"I think we need to be really careful not to conflate those two things, because otherwise we have a danger of doing things like shutting down free speech.\"\nBrendan, a Kennedy School graduate student, agreed with Enos about First Amendment rights. \n\"I find that criticism of Israel is not antisemitic, and we should be protecting free speech, and I think that's important right now. I'm glad Harvard's standing up for free speech,\" Brendan said.\nHarvard received an \"F\" grade in 2024 from the Anti-Defamation League in its Campus Antisemitism Report Card due to what it deemed inadequate administrative responses and a hostile campus climate for Jewish students. Harvard moved to a \"C\" grade in 2025, after settling two lawsuits and providing additional protections for Jewish students.\nHARVARD IS FIGHTING THE WHITE HOUSE HARDER THAN IT EVER FOUGHT ANTISEMITISM\nA drone view shows anti-Israel protesters voluntarily packing up their encampment on the Yard at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, on May 14, 2024. (Reuters/Brian Snyder TPX IMAGES OF THE DAY)\nTrump's Joint Task Force to Combat Antisemitism responded to Garber's statement of noncompliance, saying, \"The disruption of learning that has plagued campuses in recent years is unacceptable. The harassment of Jewish students is intolerable.\" \nAside from the $2.2 billion from the federal government, Harvard has the largest endowment among U.S. universities, sitting at $53.2 billion in 2024. The endowment funds come from philanthropic gifts, investments, trusts and other sources.\n\"I, of course, can understand why people would say, 'why should taxpayer funding go to something that already has $53 billion?'\" Enos told Fox News Digital. \"This is a question about the freedom of institutions and free speech in the United States, and so we could put aside that dollar amount and I would ultimately be fine with that as long as Harvard remains a place that is free like all institutions should be in the United States to decide what they can do for themselves.\"\nStudents Carter and Brendan had differing thoughts on whether taxpayers should be funding Harvard. Brendan would prefer taxpayer funds going to Alzheimer's research, rather than \"defense or to arming Israel,\" and Carter didn't believe Americans should foot the bill. \n\"I think if Harvard was doing the right kinds of things, if Harvard was actually supporting sort of a robust patriotic education that served Americans, then yes, I think federal funding would make sense,\" Carter said. \nStill, without government funding, Harvard is limited in its ability to use donor funds at its disposal, as most donations come with restrictions on how funds can be used. \nCarter also noted that he wasn't concerned if the school lost federal funding, citing events like \"Sex Week\" as a waste of the university's money. \n\"I mean, every single year they [Harvard] spend money doing something called 'Sex Week,' where we all learn how to do - I mean there's events offered for crazy sex practices, and that's something that the university has time and money to put on. I think that if Harvard really cares about whatever particular piece of research currently funded by the federal government, they'll be able to find the money in their budget to support it,\" he said.\nFREE SPEECH ADVOCATE SAYS HARVARD DOESN'T HAVE 'CLEAN HANDS' BUT OPPOSES TRUMP PRESSURE CAMPAIGN\nBrendan, a Kennedy School graduate student, is glad Harvard is standing up for free speech. (FOX NEWS DIGITAL)\nIn previous years, the university used private sponsor funds for events like Harvard's \"Sex Week,\" which was a series about sexual health and included educating students on events like \"Backdoor Basics: Anal 101.\"\nEnos, however, was concerned about the loss of federal funding, pointing to scientific research and the military. \nBillions of dollars of research grants to Harvard have resulted in the creation of new drugs and therapies. One example of this is Harvard-affiliated researchers helping with the early development of the COVID-19 vaccines. \n\"I am worried about the funding disappearing,\" Enos said. \"That funding goes towards things like research for deadly diseases.

If federal action is taken against a member of our community, we expect it will be based on clear evidence, follow established legal procedures, and respect the constitutional rights afforded to all individuals.\"\nThe threat to visas marks a fresh pressure point after the suspension of $2.2bn in federal grants this week following Harvard's rejection of the White House's demands for tight government oversight of its operations. \nIt also reflects broader calls by Trump and several of his officials to declare war on the country's elite universities. \nHowever, the threat will fuel the tensions within the government between Maga populists calling for tighter controls on all immigration and Silicon Valley entrepreneurs including Elon Musk who support H-1B visas for highly skilled foreign immigrants. H-1B visas are typically issued to international students choosing to stay in the US after completing their studies in the country.\nFiona Hill, chancellor of Durham university in the UK and a member of Harvard's Board of Overseers, said: \"This is the end of the golden age of the American university.\"\nAn alliance of networks of US universities earlier this month cautioned that 1mn international students attend the country's colleges and universities and contributed about $43.8bn to the economy during the 2023-2024 academic year. \nConcern has been growing about hundreds of foreign students in the US whose visas have been revoked in recent weeks. Dozens of international students have been detained by immigration officials since Trump took office.",

Noem accused Harvard of harboring anti-American and pro-Hamas ideology, while Harvard maintains its commitment to the rule of law and expects federal action to be based on clear evidence and legal procedures. This escalation follows a previous suspension of $2.2 billion in federal grants due to Harvard's refusal to comply with government oversight demands.

      "summary": "The ruling concluded a long-running dispute between feminist advocacy groups and the Scottish government.",
      "content": "The ruling concluded a long-running dispute between feminist advocacy groups and the Scottish government.\nThe United Kingdom's Supreme Court has ruled that the terms \"woman\" and \"sex\" refer to a \"biological woman and biological sex\" under UK equality laws, bringing a long-running court battle between feminist groups and the government of Scotland to an end.\nWednesday's ruling is expected to have far-reaching consequences for policies on whether and how spaces and services reserved for women should be extended to include \"trans women\" - those born male who have transitioned socially or medically or who identify as women - such as changing rooms, domestic violence shelters and medical services.\nAlthough the case originally began in Scotland, the court's interpretation of the law will be effective across the UK, including in England and Wales.\nReactions towards the ruling have been mixed: Feminist advocacy groups involved in the legal case have voiced satisfaction, while trans groups and some members of the Scottish government expressed disappointment and fear about future discrimination.\nHere's what we know about the Supreme Court's ruling and how the case started:\nThe legal dispute began in March 2018 when the Scottish Parliament passed an act stating that 50 percent of non-executive members of the boards of Scottish public bodies must be women.\nThe act, which is known as Holyrood's Gender Representation on Public Boards (Scotland) Act 2018, was supposed to ensure better representation for women in public bodies.\nA sticking point in the policy, however, was the definition of \"woman\". The act itself said that \"women\" included transgender women who held gender recognition certificates (GRCs) - that is, trans women who have legally transitioned and are certified by the government as having changed their gender.\nA feminist group, For Women Scotland (FWS), challenged the new law and launched a petition against it in 2018. The group argued that the Scottish parliament had wrongfully defined \"woman\" and that the law had failed to use legal definitions as set out in the UK Equality Act of 2010.\nThat Act prohibits discrimination based on age, disability, gender reassignment, marriage or civil partnership (in cases of employment), pregnancy and maternity, race, religion or belief, sex, and sexual orientation.\nHowever, the UK Equality Act 2010 does allow for separate or single-sex services to be provided when this is reasonably necessary, such as for reasons of privacy, decency or preventing trauma.\nA Scottish court dismissed the first case brought by FWS in 2022, concluding that the Scottish legislation did not necessarily redefine \"woman\" by including transgender women. The judge ruled that women were \"not limited to biological or birth sex\".\nFWS launched an unsuccessful appeal in 2023. The case was then heard at the Scottish Court of Session several times as the group sought to clarify how to correctly interpret the term \"woman\" as enshrined in the Equality Act.\nIn March 2024, the advocacy group, backed by other feminist organisations and lesbian groups, appealed to the Supreme Court. The group was also supported by Harry Potter author and women's rights campaigner JK Rowling, who reportedly donated 70,000 pounds ($92,000) to a crowdfunding campaign by FWS.\nOn Wednesday, five judges ruled unanimously that the term \"woman\" in the existing UK Equality Act should be interpreted as only people born biologically female, and that trans women, even those with GRCs, should be excluded from that definition.\nThe ruling further clarified, therefore, that trans women can be excluded from certain single-sex spaces and groups designated for women, such as changing rooms, homeless and domestic violence shelters, swimming areas and medical or counselling services.\n\"Interpreting 'sex' as certificated sex would cut across the definitions of 'man' and 'woman' ... and, thus, the protected characteristic of sex, in an incoherent way,\" Justice Patrick Hodge said while summarising the case. \"It would create heterogeneous groupings.\"\nThe court added that the ruling was not a \"triumph\" of one side over the other, and emphasised that transgender people are still protected from discrimination under UK law. However, some protections, the judges clarified, should only apply to biological females and not transgender women.\nUntil now, trans women with GRCs could be counted as women for the purpose of all-women shortlists for political parties or to fill quotas for women on boards or within organisations. This will no longer be the case.\nIn the 20 years since the Gender Recognition Act was passed in the UK, nearly 8,500 GRCs have been issued.\nThe Gender Recognition Panel received 1,397 applications for GRCs in 2023-2024 - a record number. Of those, 1,088 were granted. This was triple the number of applications in 2020-2021, after which the application fee dropped from 140 to 5 pounds ($180 to $7).\nThe ruling provides some clarification on an issue that has proved polarising not only in the UK but also in the United States.\nDebates have raged in both countries, as well as in other Western nations, on whether certain women's rights, services or spaces should be extended to trans women. US President Donald Trump is facing legal challenges for signing orders to define sex as only male or female. Trump has also tried to ban transgender people from entering the military and block trans people from participating in sports teams that do not align with their biological sex.\nIt's unclear how the ruling could affect sport in the UK, but trans women may now be restricted, if not excluded, from women's categories. There's no nationwide rule on how different sport organisations should include transgender people. Presently, the English Football Association allows trans women to compete in the women category if their testosterone levels are below five nanomoles per litre for at least 12 months. Women typically have 2.5 nanomoles per litre. On the other hand, British Cycling bans trans women from women's competitions altogether.\nRules regarding how domestic violence centres run may also be reassessed. In 2021, RISE, a shelter for women in Brighton, lost 5 million pounds ($6.2m) in local government funding after an assessment found that it did not provide services to trans women. The organisation said it was forced to close its refuge services for women, but was able to continue providing services like therapy.\nGroups like FWS argue that biological sex cannot be changed and that the rights of transgender people should not come at the expense of women. Allowing trans women to be included in the definition of women would reduce protection for people born female, they argue.\nPreviously, FWS director Triba Budge argued that the Scottish Act at the root of the legal case could be interpreted to mean that public boards could legally consist of \"50 percent men and 50 percent men with certificates\" - referring to trans women holding GRCs - therefore excluding biological women altogether.\nOn the other hand, trans rights groups say they require the same protections as women. The ruling on Wednesday excludes transgender people from sex discrimination protections and conflicts with human rights laws, they argue.\nThe Supreme Court's decision would also undermine protections for trans people covered in the UK's 2004 Gender Recognition Act, opponents said. The law allows trans people to obtain a GRC and update the sex recorded on their birth certificate accordingly, but trans groups say that recognition could now be undermined.\nSome believe the ruling will lead to more attacks on trans people. Rights and hate monitoring groups note that the average trans person is more likely than others to face discrimination and physical, sexual, or verbal harassment.\nStop Hate UK, which monitors attacks on minority groups in the country, reports that the UK police recorded 2,630 hate crimes against transgender people in 2021. The group said that was a 16 percent increase from the previous year and that it was likely an undercount, as most trans people do not feel safe enough to report attacks.\nFWS and other feminist groups that joined the organisation in the final Supreme Court case celebrated outside the court on Wednesday after the ruling was pronounced.\nSupporters chanted \"Women's rights are human rights\" and popped bottles of wine in celebration.\n\"Everyone knows what sex is and you can't change it,\" Susan Smith, who co-directs FWS, told The Associated Press news agency. \"It's common sense, basic common sense, and the fact that we have been down a rabbit hole where people have tried to deny science and to deny reality, and hopefully this will now see us back to reality.\"\n\"We are delighted,\" Sex Matters, another group involved in the court case, said in a statement on Wednesday. \"The court has given us the right answer: The protected characteristic of sex - male and female - refers to reality, not to paperwork,\" the statement read.\nOn the other hand, trans advocacy groups voiced disappointment.\n\"We are really shocked by today's Supreme Court decision, which reverses 20 years of understanding on how the law recognises trans men and women with Gender Recognition Certificates,\" Scottish Trans said in a statement.\nThe group also accused the court of hearing only from organisations on one side of the debate, and not from trans people. \"We think their judgement reflects the fact that trans people's voices were missing,\" the statement read.\nMaggie Chapman, a legislator of Scotland's Green Party which has been at the forefront of championing trans rights, said the ruling was \"deeply concerning\" for human rights and \"a huge blow to some of the most marginalised people in our society\".\n\"Trans people have been cynically targeted and demonised by politicians and large parts of the media for far too long. This has contributed to attacks on longstanding rights and attempts to erase their existence altogether,\" Chapman added.\nMeanwhile, the Scottish government said it would accept the ruling.\nThe Scottish Government accepts today's Supreme Court judgement. The ruling gives clarity between two relevant pieces of legislation passed at Westminster. We will now engage on the implications of the ruling. Protecting the rights of all will underpin our actions.\n-- John Swinney (@JohnSwinney) April 16, 2025 \n In a statement posted on X, Scotland's First Minister John Swinney said the law provided clarity and would be followed.\n\"We will now engage on the implications of the ruling. Protecting the rights of all will underpin our actions,\" Swinney said.\nThe UK government said the law would clarify issues of service provision in hospitals, refuges, and sports clubs, although in what ways exactly is not yet clear.\n\"Single-sex spaces are protected in law and will always be protected by this government,\" a spokesperson said.\nIt is expected that government institutions across the UK will begin to make changes in line with the ruling.\nOne example of the ruling's potential effect is the case of a Scottish health organisation which is being sued by a nurse it suspended over her objection to a trans woman using a female changing room. The organisation, NHS Fife, said it had noted the judgement.\n\"We will now take time to carefully consider the judgement and its implications,\" a spokesperson said.\nBritish Transport Police has already updated a controversial search policy from September 2024 that allowed transgender detainees with a GRC to be searched by officers of their acquired gender. That has now changed, spokesperson Daisy Collingwood told Al Jazeera.\n\"We have advised our officers that any same-sex searches in custody are to be undertaken in accordance with the biological birth sex of the detainee,\" Collingwood said. \"We are in the process of reviewing the implications of the ruling and will consider any necessary updates to our policies and practices in line with the law and national guidance.\"\nMeanwhile, legal experts say the ruling showed equality legislation might need to be urgently updated to ensure trans people are protected. \n Follow Al Jazeera English:",
      "ml_hf_summary": "This article provides a detailed account of the Supreme Court's decision on transgender rights in the UK. Here's a breakdown of the key points:\n\n**The Decision:**\n\n* The Supreme Court ruled that the definition of \"sex\" under UK law should be based on biological sex at birth, not gender identity. This means that protections for trans people are limited and may require significant changes to existing legislation.\n* The ruling clarifies the legal distinction between male and female in terms of service provision (e.g., hospitals, refuges, sports clubs). \n\n**Reactions:**\n\n* **Transgender Advocacy Groups:**  Express disappointment and concern about the impact on trans rights. They argue that the ruling ignores the lived experiences of transgender people and undermines their human rights.\n* **Feminist Groups:** Celebrate the decision as a victory for women's rights, arguing that it clarifies the definition of sex and protects women's spaces. \n* **Scottish Government:**  Acknowledges the ruling and will engage in further discussions about its implications. They emphasize protecting the rights of all individuals.\n* **British Transport Police:**  Has updated their search policy to align with the ruling, requiring searches based on biological sex at birth.\n\n**Potential Impacts:**\n\n* **Healthcare:** Hospitals and other healthcare facilities may need to review policies regarding access to single-sex spaces and services for transgender patients. \n* **Refugees:** Shelters and support organizations will likely face challenges in providing safe and inclusive environments for trans individuals seeking refuge.\n* **Sports Clubs:**  The ruling could impact the provision of single-sex spaces in sports clubs, potentially leading to changes in policies and practices.\n\n**Legal Implications:**\n\n* The ruling highlights the need for urgent updates to equality legislation to ensure that transgender people are protected under the law. \n\n\n**Overall:** This decision has significant implications for trans rights in the UK. It is likely to lead to ongoing legal challenges, policy changes, and social debate about gender identity and its place within society.  \n"

Under the ruling this would be scrapped. \nThe EHRC says it is \"working at pace\" to provide an updated code of conduct for services, including the NHS and prisons, and it expects its updated guidance to be in place by the summer.\nThe ruling could have implications for spaces such as hospital wards, changing rooms and domestic refuges.\nAsked whether the EHRC would pursue the NHS if it doesn't change, Baroness Falkner replied \"yes we will\". \n\"We will be having those conversations with them to update that guidance,\" she said.\nAn NHS spokesperson told the BBC the service was \"reviewing guidance on same sex accommodation\" and as part of this process \"will consider and take into account all relevant legislation and the Supreme Court ruling\".\nWednesday's case was brought by women's rights campaigners who challenged the Scottish government, arguing sex-based protections should apply only to people that are born female.\nJudges ruled that when the term \"woman\" is used in the Equality Act it means a biological woman, and \"sex\" means biological sex.\nThis means a Gender Recognition Certificate (GRC) - a legal document that recognises an individual's gender identity - will now not change a person's legal sex for the purposes of the Equality Act.\nThe Supreme Court justices argued this was the only consistent, coherent interpretation.\nThere is already Equality Act guidance which allows for women-only spaces, such as toilets, changing rooms and hospital wards in certain circumstances.\nBut under the new ruling a person who was born male but identifies as a woman does not have a right to use a space or service designated as women only.\nThat includes transgender women who have legally changed their gender and hold a GRC.\nBaroness Falkner said trans people should use their \"power of advocacy\" to ask for facilities including a \"third space\" for toilets.\n\"Single-sex services like changing rooms must be based on biological sex if a male person is allowed to use - it's no longer a single sex space.\"\nShe added the ruling was \"a victory for common sense only if you recognise that trans people exist, they have rights and their rights must be respected\".\nBritish Transport Police said trans women in custody would now be searched by male officers as an interim measure while it reviews its policies and practices.\n\"Under previous policy, we had advised that someone with a GRC may be searched in accordance with their acquired sex,\" a spokesperson said.\n\"However as an interim position while we digest yesterday's judgement, we have advised our officers that any same sex searches in custody are to be undertaken in accordance with the biological birth sex of the detainee.\"\nBaroness Falkner said the next stage of litigation may well be tests of the efficacy of GRCs.\nAsked about whether she thought GRCs were now \"worthless\", she replied: \"We don't believe they are. We think they're quite important.\"\nThe new guidance could also have an impact on women's sport, where the question over whether transgender women can participate has been a high-profile issue in recent years.\nSports have tightened up rules around transgender athletes at the elite levels. Athletics, cycling and aquatics have banned transgender women from taking part in women's events, while other sports have put in place eligibility criteria. \nConservative leader Kemi Badenoch said a review on gender and equality laws was \"a good idea\".\nSpeaking to broadcasters during a visit to Cambridge, she said: \"We need to make sure that the law is clear and the public bodies follow the law, not guidance from organisations that don't understand it.\"\nShe added the laws needed to be updated to ensure that they are \"there to prevent discrimination, not for social engineering\".\nScottish Greens MSP Maggie Chapman, a prominent supporter of trans rights, told the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme the decision would \"stoke the fires of the culture war\" and trans people now feared they could lose access to facilities they've used, in some cases, for decades.\nShe added that trans people had been attacked in recent years \"just for being who they are\" and she was \"concerned\" about the impact of the Supreme Court decision.\nTrans rights campaigners have said they will be examining the judgment closely to decide on their next steps.\nThe UK government has welcomed the \"clarity and confidence\" for women and service providers brought by the judgement.\nA government spokesperson said: \"Single sex spaces are protected in law and will always be protected by this government, and trusts should follow the clarity the ruling provides.\"\nHealth minister Karin Smyth said the government would be reviewing the ruling to \"make sure we are fully compliant with it\" and would be working with equality bodies to make sure organisations were fully compliant.\nShe said the government was not interested in \"so-called culture wars\" and believed that everybody should have \"their dignity and privacy and their rights respected\".\n\"I think now is the time to make sure that we look to the future, that rights are very clear for people and that service providers absolutely make sure they comply with the law,\" she said.\nCampaigners say the trans community is now worried that \"people are coming after their right to exist\" as a result of the ruling. \nThe call comes after the Supreme Court gave a legal definition of a woman under equality law. \nThe ruling on the meaning of the term \"woman\" in law is a \"victory for common sense\", the EHRC's chair says.\nPolice are investigating a suspected hate crime after an LGBTQ-themed bench is set on fire.\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

      "content": "After years of argument and dispute about the meaning of gender, the watchword of Wednesday's Supreme Court ruling has to be clarity.\nEquality law has been made clear with the unambiguous statement that the term \"woman\" refers to a biological woman and does not include biological men who identify as women.\nIt is a \"victory for common sense\", according to the chairwoman of the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC).\nBaroness Falkner added: \"If a male is allowed to use a women-only service, it isn't any longer a single-sex space.\"\nThis is a world away from the carefully chosen language which has been used to navigate gender issues for much of the last decade.\nThe Equality Act, which protects people who have been through gender reassignment from harassment, discrimination and sex discrimination, is enforced by the EHRC. \nIt is now updating its statutory code of conduct to take account of the judgment, saying that, with this new framework, it should be in a better position to enforce the law where it finds breaches.\nIt was directly involved in the Supreme Court case because it said inconsistencies over whether the term sex included or excluded transgender people with gender recognition certificates (GRC) was making equality law unworkable.\nThe ruling removes any ambiguity. Now, a GRC will not change a person's legal sex for the purposes of the Equality Act.\nPublic bodies - from the NHS and prisons to sports clubs and businesses - will already be reviewing their policies.\nWomen's toilets, changing rooms and other single sex spaces will be for biological women only.\nIn theory, that means a transgender man or woman should use facilities that correspond to their biological sex.\nHowever, this is likely to present other difficulties as the person will be presenting as their gender identity to the outside world.\nBaroness Falkner argues that transgender people should use \"their power of advocacy\" to persuade organisations to provide third spaces such as unisex toilets.\nCases such as that of the nurse, Sandie Peggie, who was suspended after refusing to share a changing room with a transgender doctor, are likely to be reviewed.\nNHS Fife, the health board involved in the case, told the BBC that it noted the clarity provided by the ruling and would \"carefully consider the judgment\".\nFollowing the ruling, transwomen cannot compete in women's sport, the EHRC says.\nSport has been one of the most hotly contested areas in the debate about gender. In recent years, many sports have tightened rules around transgender athletics at elite levels.\nAthletics, cycling and aquatics, for example, have banned transgender women from taking part in women's events.\nOther sports have put eligibility criteria in place. Earlier this month, the English Football Association introduced stricter rules - but still allowed transgender women to continue to compete in the women's game on the condition that their testosterone was kept below a certain level.\nHowever, it will take time to consider the implications on eligibility in elite sport, so there will not be any immediate change. Governing bodies are not compelled to amend or reconsider their rules - but if their rules now break equality law, they could face enforcement action.\nFor some there will be concerns about what the ruling means for transgender people.\nThe Supreme Court justices emphasised that transgender people already have protections against discrimination and harassment written into the Equality Act.\nThe EHRC will look to protect these rights, and Baroness Falkner said they \"stand ready to support those people\".\nTrans rights campaigners have said they will be examining the judgment closely to decide their next steps - and it is possible they could attempt to put pressure on the government to change the Equality Act.\nCampaigners say the trans community is now worried that \"people are coming after their right to exist\" as a result of the ruling. \nThe call comes after the Supreme Court gave a legal definition of a woman under equality law. \nIt comes after a Supreme Court ruling that the legal definition of a woman is based on biological sex.\nThe suit comes after a public spat between the state's governor and Donald Trump over transgender women competing in sports.\nSir Keir Starmer and other leaders have tied themselves in knots over the question: \"What is a woman?\"\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

Under the law I am a woman. I dress like a woman. I act like a woman. And I am a woman.\n\"If I go to the toilet and there is another woman in there, they don't know whether I have got a gender recognition certificate or not.\"\nKerrie also believes that recognition certificates should only be granted if someone has undergone gender reassignment surgery.\nUnder the new ruling, a person who was born male but identifies as a woman does not have a right to use a space or service designated as women only, even if they have legally changed their gender.\nBaroness Kishwer Falkner, the chair of the EHRC, said trans people should use their \"power of advocacy\" to ask for facilities including a \"third space\" for toilets.\nShe told the BBC's Today programme: \"Single-sex services like changing rooms must be based on biological sex. If a male person is allowed to use, it no longer is a single sex space.\"\nShe added the ruling was \"a victory for common sense only if you recognise that trans people exist, they have rights and their rights must be respected\".\nBaroness Kishwer added public bodies like the NHS would be expected to update their advice, and that the EHRC would pursue any organisations which did not.\nBillie Robertson, a hotel worker from Arran who now lives in Ayrshire, told BBC Scotland News she had been left in shock by the news and was concerned about the impact on day to day life.\nShe said: \"It feels like I've been placed in an 'other' category. The court said transgender rights aren't going to be affected, but there's been no further discussion on 'this is where you can and can't be, so here's alternatives'.\n\"It just feels like a very definitive statement without any follow-up for the group of people who are affected.\"\nMs Robertson, 28, said she felt she had regressed within herself after the news as \"you do take the opinion of so many people onboard, and you think maybe I am delusional\".\nHowever she added she was trying to focus on the small things and the \"love and respect\" friends and colleagues have shown her.\nScottish Greens MSP Maggie Chapman, a prominent supporter of trans rights, told the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme the decision would \"stoke the fires of the culture war\" and trans people now feared they could lose access to facilities they've used, in some cases, for decades.\nShe said: \"The response by For Women Scotland and other associated groups was very, very clear - they are taking this as a victory and that is potentially dangerous about where they go next.\n\"We've already heard people say they want to repeal the gender recognition act 2004, and trans people are worried that people are coming after their right to exist.\" \nHowever Rachel Hamilton, of the Scottish Conservatives, told Good Morning Scotland the court's decision was \" basic common sense\" and would being \"clarity\" to the trans debate.\nShe said: \"The reason we ended up at the Supreme Court is because there was confusion in Scotland. Now we have a clear and unambiguous decision on what is a biological woman.\"\nShe said the Scottish government must set out a ministerial statement on how they would move forward with the Supreme Court ruling.\nAsh Regan, the Alba party MSP who quit the SNP over the party's stance on gender, lodged a motion in the Scottish Parliament calling for \"urgent action\" to end self-identification in Scottish hospitals, public bodies, schools and prisons.\nShe claimed it was a \"victory for women across the country\" and that current gender self-identification laws jeopardised \"the safety, privacy and dignity\" of women and girls.\nRegan told BBC Scotland News the verdict yesterday was a \"humiliation\" for the Scottish government.\nShe added: \"The government has been making a mockery of Scotland by going to the Supreme Court to argue that men can be lesbians. They've got to take notice of this - this ideology has taken root across the public sector. \n\"The government could start [upholding women's rights] today by issuing very clear guidance for the whole of the public sector and they could send out a very strong signal by removing men from the women's prison estate.\" \nAn updated code of practice by the EHRC is expected to be laid before Parliament before the summer recess.\nThe code helps service providers, public bodies and associations to understand their duties under the Equality Act and put them into practice.\nThe Scottish government's finance minister Shona Robison previously told BBC News the administration would work with the EHRC and the UK government \"at pace\" on the guidance.\nBritish Transport Police announced that while previously someone with a GRC could be searched by their acquired sex, officers have now been advised that same sex searches in custody would be undertaken by the person's biological birth sex.\nPolice discovered quantities of cannabis in the Lothians, Edinburgh and East Ayrshire.\nIt comes after a Supreme Court ruling that the legal definition of a woman is based on biological sex.\nThe ruling on the meaning of the term \"woman\" in law is a \"victory for common sense\", the EHRC's chair says.\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

      "content": "First Minister John Swinney has been urged to apologise to women over the government's plan to reform gender recognition laws. \nScottish Conservative leader Russell Findlay attacked Swinney over a bill passed by MSPs in 2022 that would have made it make it easier for people to change their legally recognised sex. \nThat bill was blocked by the UK government and Findlay's comments came after the Supreme Court sided against Holyrood ministers in a ruling on the definition of a woman. \nSocial Justice Secretary Shirley-Anne Somerville said ministers were committed to protecting protecting women's and transgender rights. \nThe Supreme Court sided with campaign group For Women Scotland in ruling that the terms \"woman\" and \"sex\" in the 2010 Equality Act \"refer to a biological woman and biological sex\".\nThe ruling means people who are born male no longer have access to female-only facilities and services. \nSwinney said he accepted the judgement.\nThe Scottish Parliament passed the Gender Recognition (Reform) Bill in 2022, with MSPs from all parties backing the proposals.\nThe move was blocked by the UK government, and has since been dropped by Scottish ministers.\nThe proposed reforms sparked years of heated over debate over women's rights.\nIn a speech in Edinburgh, Findlay said: \"To restore trust in politics, John Swinney must be big enough to admit his mistakes and apologise for the bitter divisions that this has created.\n\"If he really wants to bring people together, he should start with the women and girls who have lost faith in Scotland's political establishment.\"\nHe urged the first minister to \"formally end the divisive policy of gender self-identification\".\nFindlay said: \"He must send a clear message that he and his government fully respect the law and women's rights.\"\nSomerville reiterated that the Scottish government had \"no intention\" of bringing the gender recognition reforms back to parliament or seeking to overturn the UK government block on the bill. \nShe said the Supreme Court judgement, as well as updated guidance from the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC), would provide clarity on access to public services. \nThe EHRC said it will release an updated code of conduct for services, including the NHS and prisons, in the summer.\nSomerville said Scottish ministers would meet with body next week. The government will also set out its next steps in a statement to parliament in the coming days. \nEHRC chair Baroness Kishwer Falkner told the BBC's Today programme: \"Single-sex services like changing rooms must be based on biological sex.

      "content": "Equality watchdog says health service 'now has clarity' as managers draw up new policy for hospitals and surgeries\nNHS bosses are scrambling to overhaul guidelines for single-sex spaces in thousands of hospitals and GP surgeries after the equality watchdog warned they would be pursued if they fail to do so.\nThe British Transport Police became the first to change policies on Thursday amid the fallout from the supreme court ruling on the legal definition of a woman, piling pressure on the health service and other organisations to revamp their guidance.\nCurrent NHS guidance in England says trans people should be accommodated based on how they dress, their names and their pronouns. Under Wednesday's ruling that a woman is defined by biological sex under the Equality Act 2010, this would be scrapped.\nSenior NHS legal officials and estates and facilities managers are racing to draw up proposals for how hospitals, community care centres and GP practices should reflect the ruling, sources told the Guardian.\nThe ruling poses a challenge for the NHS, which has an estate spanning 25m square metres in England alone, with infrastructure repair bills of more than PS14bn. The issue is further complicated by the fact that health policy and spending is devolved in Wales and Scotland.\nKishwer Falkner, the chair of the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC), told BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Thursday: \"They [the NHS] have to change it. They now have clarity.\n\"There is no confusion as of yesterday, at 10.30 in the morning, and they can start to implement the new legal reasoning and produce their exceptions forthwith, but they have to change it. We will be having conversations with them to update that guidance.\"\nAsked if the EHRC would pursue the matter if the NHS did not do so, she replied: \"Yes, we will.\"\nAn NHS England spokesperson said: \"The NHS is currently reviewing guidance on same-sex accommodation and, as part of this process, will consider and take into account all relevant legislation and [Wednesday's] ruling.\"\nMeanwhile, the BTP, which patrols the railways in Great Britain, announced that male officers would conduct intimate searches of trans women \"in accordance with the biological birth sex of the detainee\", while trans men would be searched by female officers.\nUnder the force's previous policy, officers had been told that anyone in custody with a gender recognition certificate would be searched by an officer matching a detainee's acquired gender.\nThe update comes during a legal battle between gender-critical campaigners and the force over its guidance that allowed transgender officers to strip-search women, so long as the officer held a gender recognition certificate.\nThe rapid change of approach came after Lady Falkner said the EHRC would be issuing updated and legally binding codes of practice on single-sex spaces and services in the wake of the \"enormously consequential\" court ruling.\n\"We are going to have a new statutory code of practice [meaning] it will be interpreted by courts as the law of the land. We're hoping we're going to have that by the summer,\" she told Today.\nShe said the judgment meant only biological women could use single-sex changing rooms and women's toilets, or participate in women-only sporting events and teams, or be placed in women's wards in hospitals.\nEven so, the commission \"will not tolerate\" discrimination or harassment of trans people, which remains unlawful under the Equality Act, and would support trans women taking out equal pay claims under sex discrimination laws.\nFalkner said the ruling was \"a victory for common sense\" but \"only if you recognise that trans people exist, they have rights and their rights must be respected. Then it becomes a victory for common sense.\"\nThe UK government has avoided making any substantial comment on the ruling, but a strong indication of Labour's approach came from Anas Sarwar, the Scottish Labour leader, who swung the party behind the supreme court and the EHRC's stance.\nPreviously a supporter of self-identification for trans people, Sarwar said there was now a need for an \"urgent\" update of Scotland's policies on single-sex spaces. Scottish ministers are expected to update Holyrood next week on their response to the ruling.\n\"I've always said that we should protect single-sex spaces on the basis of all biological sex,\" he said during a visit in Falkirk. \"There's a clear ruling now from the supreme court.\"\nThe bulk of the reaction from Westminster politicians continued to come from the Conservatives. Speaking during a local elections campaign visit to Cambridgeshire, Kemi Badenoch, the Tory leader, said the court decision was a vindication of their views.\nShe said she would support changes to the Equality Act and Gender Recognition Act to cement the court's view. \"These laws were written 20 years ago plus when the world was different. A lot of people are trying to change what the law means,\" she said.\nIn contrast, there was little sign of how ministers will help institutions navigate the new framework. Rachel Reeves, the chancellor, on a visit to Scunthorpe, dodged some questions on the issue, saying only that more advice would come in \"due course\".\nAmong the issues that will need to be tackled is provision of toilet facilities for transgender people, given the EHRC said the ruling means they will not be able to use single-sex toilets.\nA directive introduced by Badenoch when she was equalities minister last year requires new public buildings such as offices and shopping centres to prioritise single-sex toilets, and to provide universal toilets only \"where space allows\".\nThat regulation remains in force, meaning public buildings could become increasingly inaccessible for transgender users.",
      "ml_hf_summary": "The UK Supreme Court ruling on the legal definition of a woman has prompted NHS England to overhaul its guidelines for single-sex spaces. The Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) stated that the NHS must change its guidance based on the new legal reasoning, which now defines a woman as someone with biological sex.  This follows the British Transport Police's update to their policies, reflecting the ruling. The EHRC has pledged to issue updated codes of practice by summer and will pursue the NHS if they fail to comply. The UK government has remained silent on the ruling, while Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar called for an urgent policy update in Scotland. Conservative MP Kemi Badenoch expressed support for changes to the Equality Act and Gender Recognition Act to reflect the court's decision.

      "content": "The supreme court judgment is contradictory and confused. And there seems no prospect of the Labour government sorting this out\nA person has to be tough to be transgender. Given the problems that can be associated with coming out to family, friends and work colleagues, the constant vilification of trans people by certain parts of the media and on social media and the internal emotional turmoil transition entails, it requires mental strength beyond the ordinary. I should know - I have walked that path.\nYesterday, transgender people were dealt a blow from a source I would not have predicted when I transitioned 13 years ago - the UK supreme court. In a case concerning representation on the boards of public bodies in Scotland, the supreme court ruled that in the 2010 Equality Act (EA), \"sex\" should be taken to be \"biological sex\", in the sense of the sex recorded on a citizen's original birth certificate, and does not include \"certified sex\" where a transgender person has obtained a gender recognition certificate (GRC) by the process set out in the 2004 Gender Recognition Act. This renders a GRC valueless for the purposes of the Equality Act.\nThe 2004 legislation was not granted by a benevolent UK government but enacted after the UK lost the case of Goodwin v UK in 2002, in the European Court of Human Rights, which held that the UK lacked a process for the state to acknowledge and accept a transgender person's acquired gender. The 2004 GRA included a number of exceptions, including one that deferred to any future legislation.\nIn this case, the supreme court found that, while there is not explicit exemption in the EA, there was an implied exemption given the stresses and strains caused by \"sex\" meaning different things in different parts of the act, and in particular the possibility that a \"trans man\" might be pregnant when the pregnancy and maternity provisions referred to protecting \"women\". Strangely enough, at the two previous stages of the case at the outer and inner houses of the Scottish court of sessions, the courts had felt able to live with those stresses and strains and ruled that \"sex\" included \"certified sex\".\nWe now know that the supreme court was indeed wrong in its judgment. Melanie Field, the civil servant who led the team that created the EA, has since come out publicly to say that it was \"based on the clear premise that for a person with a gender recognition certificate (GRC), their 'sex' for the purposes of the EA is that recorded on their GRC\". Harriet Harman, the minister who introduced the bill, has contradicted this, saying that the ruling \"correctly interprets the Equality Act, giving effect to our intention when drafting it\". This may be true of the EA, but it doesn't seem to take into account the GRA position on certified sex - and as Field has correctly pointed out, some of the exceptions written into the EA permitting the exclusion of trans people (for example, in competitive sport) make no sense under the supreme court's interpretation. They were clearly based on the assumption of certified sex. It seems that the law of unintended consequences now stalks the halls.\nThe fact that no trans person or organisation appeared before the supreme court (an intervention by two trans grandees, one a professor of equalities law and the other a retired judge was refused) seems telling to trans people. Imagine, if you will, a discussion of women's rights with all women excluded. The trans-positive intervention of Amnesty earns an honourable mention.\nThe supreme court's judgment is clearly wrong in another way. Following Goodwin, the UK was obliged to provide an effective route for transgender people to have their affirmed gender recognised. If a significant part of the legal protections afforded to citizens is denied to them, the UK would once again appear to be in breach of its obligations to the European convention of human rights.\nThere seems no prospect, in the present political climate, of the Labour government sorting this out. It seems that transgender people will have to find the right case and walk the long path to the European court of human rights in Strasbourg once again.\nIn the meantime, what difference will the 88-page judgment actually make for transgender people in the UK? Most do not have a GRC. Estimates vary, but there are about 100,000 trans people and perhaps 6,000 with GRCs. I have already seen comments suggesting that some among the anti-trans lobby think that trans people are likely to be banned from toilets in public buildings, changing rooms and the like by the end of the Easter holidays. Fortunately, while service providers can exclude trans people - and this ruling makes it easier to do so - most do not. We do not have laws requiring that, and the discussions in the hours after the ruling with service providers did not suggest that any I spoke to are going to change their practice or instigate an anti-trans crusade. Nevertheless, we would expect responsible politicians to be calming the debate rather than fuelling the flames.\nThe supreme court was keen to emphasise the continuing protection for trans people - most, if not all of whom, will have the protected characteristic of gender reassignment. It is highly likely that if a policy of \"use your birth sex facility\" were imposed, it would be indirectly discriminatory against those with the protected characteristic of gender reassignment - and given the unacceptability of having trans women using the men's facilities and trans men the ladies', such a policy could not be justified as a proportionate means of achieving a legitimate aim. More concerning, perhaps, are the implications for other legislation in which the meaning of \"sex\", \"woman\" and \"man\" are important.\nA certainty is that this will remain a fertile area for lawyers for some time to come - and will therefore provide some further tough and uncertain days for trans people across the UK.\nRobin Moira White is a discrimination barrister at Old Square Chambers, London, and joint author of A Practical Guide to Transgender Law\nDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The Supreme Court's decision is controversial, with experts questioning its reasoning and potential consequences for other legislation. While the Labour government may face challenges in addressing this issue, it remains unclear how trans rights will be affected in practice. \n"

      "content": "It is vital that we give credit to the tireless campaigners who brought us to this point\nSo, after all that, it turns out that under the Equality Act, a woman is an adult human female. A man is an adult human male.\nThe unanimous UK supreme court ruling delivered on Wednesday is a big step towards clearing up the almighty mess created by politicians in Scotland, who got so carried away with promoting transgender rights that they decided transgender women ought to be eligible for seats on public boards on preferential terms that are for women.\nThis argument was taken apart in a judgment that was as far as possible from the fudge predicted by some. The judges ruled in favour of For Women Scotland, the feminist voluntary organisation that brought the case, that the protected characteristic of \"sex\" and the terms \"man\" and \"woman\" in the Equality Act refer to biology, not gender identity. A gender recognition certification (which formally acknowledges a person's transition) does not alter their sex in this piece of legislation.\nAcross 88 pages, the judges explained how any other reading of the act would render it unworkable. They showed that language used in clauses about pregnancy and maternity makes it clear that sex refers to biology. The claim by the inner house of the court of session, Scotland's highest court, that words could mean different things in sections of the same act was dismissed. Instead, the UK supreme court emphasised \"the need for a meaning which is constant and predictable\". People ought to be able to understand the law without a glossary to guide them.\nPublic services including prisons and hospital changing rooms have been in the news a good deal recently. Provisions in the Equality Act dealing with associations have had less attention until now, but submissions on this issue appear to have been crucial. Had the court ruled in favour of the Scottish government, lesbians and gay men would have lost the legal right to form associations limited to people of the same sex and orientation. People of the other sex, with a gender recognition certificate, could no longer have been excluded.\nThat the resulting \"loss of autonomy and dignity for lesbians\" was part of the court's reasoning is one of the most significant elements of this judgment. Resistance to transgender rights activism from lesbian and gay groups has been alternately dismissed and denounced. But the impact on lesbians of gender identity policies is massive, since they have a particular and historic commitment to female-only culture and spaces.\nThe judges stress that their role is limited to interpreting statute. It is not for them to adjudicate on the definitions of gender or sex, or \"the meaning of the word 'woman'\", in other contexts. People can continue to use words in whatever way they want. But the Equality Act - which incorporated earlier legislation including the Sex Discrimination Act 1975 - is the vital underpinning for societal rules and norms around fairness and equal treatment. Ever since another volunteer-led feminist group, Woman's Place UK, highlighted the single-sex exceptions in the act as a basis for their campaign to defend sex-based rights, questions about the functioning of the exceptions, and the language in the act, have been hotly debated. That has now been settled. Unless the supreme court's decision is appealed and overturned, or legislation is changed, biological women are a protected class in law.\nAs important as this is, it is not an end-point. It is almost four years since Maya Forstater won a crucial appeal and established that the gender-critical belief that sex is binary and immutable is legally protected. Since then, numerous cases have been brought by women who were penalised by employers because they did not subscribe to the contrary belief in gender identity. Several more are working their way through the system. Outside the courts, gender critical feminist activists have engaged in other forms of campaigning and lobbying, setting up groups and charities, producing research, writing books and articles.\nI have thought about all this for years, and still don't fully understand how trans activist demands, above all the push for legal gender self-identification, were so widely adopted. Under Boris Johnson, the Tories changed direction. But it must be remembered that it was under Maria Miller, a Conservative chair, that the women and equalities committee recommended a system of self-ID about a decade ago.\nI think the absorption of these ideas into western progressive orthodoxy has been a grave error. By re-energising socially conservative opposition to shifting gender norms, roles and behaviours, this uncritical adoption of a contested belief that goes far beyond the protection against discrimination to which trans people are, of course, entitled, has fuelled a broader backlash against human rights. Hostility to \"gender ideology\" from the right of the Tory party, Putin, Trump and other authoritarian leaders has made it hard for some liberals to admit this possibility. Despite their borrowings from intellectual postmodernism, gender identity activists (including such luminaries as Judith Butler) take a binary view of our complicated world in which anyone who doesn't line up with them must be on Team Trump. This polarising stance has already had the effect of increasing division and hostility.\nThe judges have done their job in upholding the rights of women, and same-sex attracted people, alongside those of transgender people - all of whom have the legally protected characteristic of gender reassignment. It must be hoped that the court's unequivocal judgment brings the ending of this wounding chapter in our politics closer, along with a sharper awareness that equality law is always a balancing process.\nBut the plaudits this week should go to For Women Scotland. The determination to hold on to sex-based rights and protections built up over centuries has galvanised an extraordinary renaissance of the women's movement in Britain.\nSusanna Rustin is a social affairs journalist and the author of Sexed: A History of British Feminism\nDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

We're hoping we're going to have that by the summer.\"\nShe said it would give \"clarity\" that trans women could not participate in women's sports or use women-only toilets or changing rooms, and the NHS must update its guidance on single-sex wards based on biological sex.\nAsked if the supreme court ruling was \"a victory for common sense\", she said: \"Only if you recognise that trans people exist, they have rights and their rights must be respected. Then it becomes a victory for common sense.\n\"It's not a victory for an increase in unpleasant actions against trans people. We will not tolerate that. We stand here to defend trans people as much as we do anyone else. So I want to make that very clear.\"\nShe emphasised that trans people still had clear protection under legislation. \"They are covered through gender reassignment ... and they're also covered by sex discrimination.\"\nAsked to give an example, she said: \"We'll have to flesh this out in the reasoning, but I think if you were to have an equal pay claim, then depending on which aspect of it that it was, you could use sex discrimination legislation. If a trans person was fired, lost their employment because they happen to be trans, that would be unlawful, still absolutely unlawful, and we stand ready to support those people and those claims.\"\nOn the risk that trans people will no longer be able to use facilities designed for either male or female, she added that trans rights organisations should push for more neutral third spaces. \"But I think the law is quite clear that if a service provider says we're offering a women's toilet, that trans people should not be using that single-sex facility.\"\nFalkner added that the EHRC would pursue the NHS to change its existing guidance on the treatment of trans patients, which currently say that trans people should be accommodated in single-sex accommodation according to their gender identity, rather than their assigned sex at birth.\n\"They [the NHS] have to change it. They now have clarity,\" she said. \"We will be having conversations with them to update that guidance.\"\nThe \"efficacy\" of the gender recognition certificate, a UK legal document that recognises an individual's gender identity, allowing them to legally change their sex, would be re-examined, she believed. The government is considering introducing digital IDs, \"and if digital IDs come in, then what documentation will provide the identity of that person? So it's going to be a space that we'll have to watch very carefully as we go on.\"",
      "ml_hf_summary": "The Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) chair, Lady Kishwer Falkner, stated that a new statutory code of practice will clarify the UK Supreme Court ruling regarding sex definition.

      "summary": "A mysterious group has accused Justice Minister Gérard Darmanin of declaring \"war\" on prisoners.",
      "content": "Officially, all lines of enquiry are still open into a wave of arson and gun attacks at French prisons. \nThat means police haven't ruled out the extremist left, or a foreign power such as Russia or Algeria.\nBut the conviction is growing that the attacks - 12 since Sunday night - can only have been the work of drugs gangs, hitting back at the government's latest crackdown.\nThat is certainly the belief of the government itself.\nSpeaking on Thursday morning, Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau said he was \"certain that what we're dealing with is the drugs-yobs [in French, narco-racaille]\".\n\"It's not they who have declared war on us. It's we who declared war on them with our new law on drugs trafficking. They know we're going to be hitting their wallets.\"\nIn what was obviously a co-ordinated plan over three nights, gangs set fire to cars outside prisons and a prison officer training centre. In two locations, guns were used.\nIn many attacks, the perpetrators sprayed graffiti bearing the initials DDPF, which stands for Droits des Prisonniers Francais - Rights for French Prison Inmates.\nThe group was previously unheard of, but on Tuesday it posted a video on the messaging platform Telegram showing the burning of a prison officer's car.\nIn French that is full of mistakes, the video's text accuses Justice Minister Gerard Darmanin of declaring \"war\" on prisoners.\n\"All we want is that human rights be respected,\" the text reads. \"If in 2025 we can watch TV, smoke and eat our meals without being bothered in our cells, it's only because our elders fought for these fundamental rights.\"\nPresenting themselves as defenders of human rights may not be the usual methodology of drugs gangs.\nBut nor does the DDPF come across as a classic far-left or anarchist organisation, which might more naturally be fighting for the cause.\nFor one thing, such groups tend to have intellectual underpinning which means they write grammatical and properly spelled French. Nor have far-left groups till now made prisoners' rights a particular issue.\nInvestigators have said that perpetrators of the attacks caught on video were dressed more like drugs-gang foot soldiers rather than far-left militants, who tend to come from a different social background.\nAnd in one location they wrote the wrong set of initials - DDFM - suggesting that their attachment to the supposed organisation was not exactly deep.\nThe theory of foreign manipulation is taken seriously - especially after proven cases of Russian interference such as the spraying of Stars of David in Paris after the October 7 attacks.\nRelations with Algeria are also at an all-time low at the moment.\nBut if the drugs gang theory is the favoured one, it is because means and motivation are both so easy to grasp.\nThe French government currently includes an unusual tandem: an interior and a justice minister who are not rivals; who are both on the political right; and who have pledged to fight head-on the scourge that they say is the drugs trade.\nTo this end Darmanin and Retailleau are currently steering a bill through parliament that they say will seriously hamper the drugs lords' ability to operate.\nA dedicated branch of the prosecutors' office will be created. There will be extra powers for investigators, and a special, protected status for informers.\nEven more of a threat to the drugs barons - so the government says - will be two newly converted prisons, where the 100 most powerful of them will be interned from later this year.\nIn these top-security jails, there will be much stricter rules governing visits and communication with the outside world. New measures will be in place to stop the infiltration of mobile telephones (of which tens of thousands are known to circulate in French jails).\nThe purpose is to prevent gang leaders from continuing their operations from behind bars - a security breach which has become widespread.\nThe case of Mohamed Amra, the drugs-lord whose escape last year led to the murder of two prison-officers near Rouen, is typical. \nPrison staff who went on strike in protest told the BBC how laxity inside jails was undermining morale and presenting a growing security risk. \nAmra was recaptured in Romania last month.\nThe French government sees in the prison attacks a sign that for once the drugs gangs feel intimidated - and that's why they're hitting back.\nOf course it suits the French government to say that, because it's evidence they can present to the voters that they are indeed getting tough.\nThe clincher will be when they catch one of the perpetrators and get him to explain why he did it. Investigators say we should not have to wait long.\nThe French president announced the commission on the 200th anniversary of France ordering Haiti to pay a debt for its freedom.\nThe scheme would return illegal migrants who cross the Channel in exchange for the UK taking legal migrants.\nFrance recalls its ambassador to Algeria and orders 12 Algerian diplomats to leave as tensions continue to rise.\nReal Madrid striker Kylian Mbappe will be available for the Copa del Rey final against Barcelona after receiving one-match ban for red card against Alaves. \nHelen and Gordon Mills died instantly in the crash in France, an inquest heard.\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

      "ml_hf_summary": "Since Sunday night, twelve arson and gun attacks have targeted French prisons, with authorities suspecting drug gangs as the perpetrators.  Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau believes these attacks are a response to the government's crackdown on drugs trafficking, citing the DDPF group's graffiti referencing \"human rights\" as evidence. The attacks involved setting fires outside prisons and a training center, using guns in some instances, and spray-painting initials \"DDPF,\" which stands for \"Droits des Prisonniers Français.\"  While the possibility of foreign manipulation is being considered, particularly given past Russian interference cases, the drug gang theory is favored due to its clear motives and ease of implementation. The French government has implemented a series of measures to combat drugs gangs, including a dedicated prosecutor's office, enhanced investigative powers, and the creation of high-security prisons for the most powerful offenders.  The attacks are seen as a sign that the drug gangs feel intimidated by the government's efforts. \n"

The Department of Justice's lawsuit against Maine for refusing to comply with Title IX is proof of that, as it would not exist if she had. Her insistence that this issue has nothing to do with biological males in girls' sports is not only baseless--it's absurd,\" Libby said. \n\"This isn't about states' rights, as she claims; it's about Governor Mills and Maine Democrats pushing far-left ideologies that ignore biological reality. By disregarding Title IX, they've discriminated against and endangered women and girls, and put Maine students and families at a disadvantage. Frankly, by promoting policies that erase the identities of women and girls in Maine, it's hard to believe even Governor Mills believes what she's saying.\" \nMAINE GOV JANET MILLS RESPONDS TO DOJ LAWSUIT AGAINST HER STATE OVER TRANS ATHLETES IN GIRLS' SPORTS\nLibby, who was at Wednesday's press conference where U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi announced the lawsuit, has been one of Mills' harshest critics over the last two months as the state has refused to comply with President Donald Trump's Keeping Men Out of Women's Sports executive order. After Trump signed the order on Feb. 5, Maine was one of the earliest states to show its intent not to comply with it. \nLibby brought attention to the state's ongoing trans inclusion policies when she made a social media post that identified a biologically male trans athlete who won a girls' pole vault competition for Greely High School in mid-February.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nSince the post, two federal agencies have launched investigations into the state. The Department of Agriculture has frozen funding to it, and now an official lawsuit by the DOJ has been filed. Maine has filed its own lawsuit against the Trump administration over the funding freeze and a federal judge has ruled the funding must be unfrozen.\nMeanwhile, Libby was censured by the Democrat majority in the Maine House of Representatives for her social media post on the premise that she identified a minor. Libby has since sued House Speaker Ryan Fecteau to have the censure overturned, arguing that the minor she identified had already been publicized in other media.\nFollow Fox News Digital's sports coverage on X, and subscribe to the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter.\nJackson Thompson is a sports writer for Fox News Digital.

      "content": "Trump does not have the authority to force Powell to resign. The Fed chair's term is up in May 2026\nUnited States President Donald Trump has hinted at firing Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell amid the president's frustration that the central bank will not aggressively cut interest rates.\nOn Thursday, Trump said that Powell's \"termination cannot come fast enough\".\nPowell's term does not expire until May 2026. The president does not have the authority to remove Powell from the central bank.\nTrump's attacks on Powell come after the Fed chair's speech at the Economic Club of Chicago on Wednesday. Powell said the Fed would base its decisions solely on what is best for all Americans.\n\"That's the only thing we're ever going to do,\" Powell said. \"We're never going to be influenced by any political pressure. People can say whatever they want. That's fine, that's not a problem. But we will do what we do strictly without consideration of political or any other extraneous factors.\n\"Our independence is a matter of law,\" Powell continued. \"We're not removable except for cause. We serve very long terms, seemingly endless terms.\"\nThe Republican president's broadside comes a day after Powell signalled that the Fed would keep its key interest rate unchanged, while it seeks \"greater clarity\" on the effect of policy changes in areas such as immigration, taxation, regulation and tariffs.\nPowell also reiterated that Trump's tariffs would likely raise inflation and slow the economy, which could make it harder for the Fed to cut rates anytime soon. The Fed chair suggested that the central bank would focus on fighting inflation in the wake of the tariffs, even if the duties did weaken the economy. Powell's comments contributed to a drop in stock prices on Wednesday. \n Pushing back on Powell, Trump in a social media post said, \"Oil prices are down, groceries (even eggs!) are down, and the USA is getting RICH ON TARIFFS.\"\nOn the contrary, oil prices have risen 2 percent in the last two weeks. Grocery prices have actually increased under Trump, according to the most recent consumer price index report in April, and egg prices hit record highs last month, as per the same report. Last week, the president falsely claimed the US brought in $2bn a day thanks to tariffs - it was $200m a day.\nReferring to the European Central Bank (ECB), Trump added that Powell \"should have lowered Interest Rates, like the ECB, long ago, but he should certainly lower them now. Powell's termination cannot come fast enough!\"\nThe ECB on Thursday lowered its key interest rate from 2.5 percent to 2.25 percent.\nPowell was initially nominated by Trump in 2017 and was appointed to another four-year term by former President Joe Biden in 2022. At a November news conference, Powell indicated he would not step down if Trump asked him to resign, pointing out that removal or demotion of top Fed officials was \"not permitted under the law\".\nLater on Thursday, the president doubled down on his remarks. Trump said that Powell would vacate his position as Fed chair if he asked him to. Powell has explicitly said that he would serve out the remainder of his term.\nThe president has also reportedly been talking for months with former Fed governor Kevin Warsh about his interest in removing Powell from the top post and replacing him potentially with Warsh, the Wall Street Journal reported, adding that Warsh advised Trump against such a move.\nTrump's comments come against the backdrop of a legal case at the Supreme Court that could determine whether presidents can fire the heads of independent agencies such as the Fed.\nThe case stems from Trump's firings of officials from two independent agencies. The Supreme Court last week let the firings stand while it considers the case. It could issue a broader ruling later this year that would enable the president to fire Fed officials, including the chair.\nPowell said the Fed is watching the case closely, adding it might not apply to the Fed. Lawyers for the Trump administration have argued that allowing the president to fire the two officials would not erode the Fed's independence.\n\"It is difficult to overstate the consequences at this stressed moment of a Court ruling that found that President Trump ... does have the authority to dismiss the heads of independent agencies and did not establish a clear carve-out for the Fed,\" Krishna Guha, an analyst at investment bank Evercore ISI, wrote on Thursday. \"If you liked the tariff debacle in markets, you'd love the loss-of-Fed-independence trade.\"\nPowell started Trump's second term in a relatively secure spot with a low unemployment rate and inflation progressing closer to the Fed's 2 percent target, conditions that could have spared the US central banker from the president's vitriol.\n \n But Trump's aggressive and haphazard tariffs have raised the threat of a recession with both higher inflationary pressures and slower growth, a tough spot for Powell, whose mandate is to stabilise prices and maximise employment. With the economy weakening because of Trump's choices, the president appears to be looking to pin the blame on Powell.\nTrump has unleashed a rash of tariffs that have put the US economy and the Fed in an increasingly perilous spot.\nOn April 2, the president rolled out aggressive tariff hikes based on US trade deficits with other nations, causing a financial market backlash that almost immediately led him to announce a 90-day pause in which most countries would be charged a baseline 10 percent tariff while negotiations go forward. But Trump increased his tariff hikes on China to a rate of 145 percent in addition to his existing tariffs on Canada, Mexico, autos and steel and aluminium.\nWall Street banks such as Goldman Sachs have raised their odds that a recession could start. Consumers are increasingly pessimistic in surveys about their job prospects and fearful that inflation will shoot up as the cost of the import taxes gets passed along to them. The risk of stagflation - stagnant growth and high inflation - would make it harder for the Fed to respond with the same playbook as recent downturns.\nThe Budget Lab at Yale University estimated that the increased inflationary pressures from the tariffs would be equal to the loss of $4,900 in an average US household. \n Follow Al Jazeera English:",

Powell's term expires in May 2026, and he is not subject to presidential removal without cause. Trump's comments stem from the Fed's decision to maintain current interest rates despite pressure to cut them due to economic factors like tariffs. Powell has stated that the Fed will prioritize American well-being and independence, and his term will continue as planned.  The President's actions are being scrutinized in light of a Supreme Court case regarding presidential authority over independent agencies, which could impact future Fed chair appointments. The ongoing trade disputes and their economic consequences have placed significant pressure on Powell and the Fed to navigate a complex economic landscape. \n"

      "content": "When US President Donald Trump hit China with tariffs in his first term, Vietnamese entrepreneur Hao Le saw an opportunity.\nHis company is one of hundreds of businesses that have emerged to compete with Chinese exports that have increasingly been facing restrictions from the West.\nLe's SHDC Electronics, which sits in the budding industrial hub of Hai Duong, sells $2m (PS1.5m) worth of phone and computer accessories every month to the US. \nBut that revenue could dry up if Trump imposes 46% tariffs on Vietnamese goods, a plan that is currently on hold until early July. That would be \"catastrophic for our business,\" Le says. \nAnd selling to Vietnamese consumers is not an option, he adds: \"We cannot compete with Chinese products. This is not just our challenge. Many Vietnamese companies are struggling in their own home market.\"\nTrump tariffs in 2016 sent a glut of cheap Chinese imports, originally intended for the US, into South East Asia, hurting many local manufacturers. But they also opened new doors for other businesses, often into global supply chains that wanted to cut their dependence on China. \nBut Trump 2.0 threatens to shut those doors. And that's a blow for fast-growing economies like Vietnam and Indonesia that are gunning to be key players in industries from chips to electric vehicles.\nThey also find themselves stuck between the world's two biggest economies - China, a powerful neighbour and their biggest trading partner, and the US, a key export market, which could be looking to strike a deal at Beijing's expense.\nChinese President Xi Jinping has been visiting Vietnam, Malaysia and Cambodia this week, urging unity against Trump's tariffs. The trip was long planned but has fresh urgency given how significant South East Asia is to the Chinese economy. \nChina earned a record $3.5tn from exports in 2024 - 16% of its exports go to South East Asia, making it the biggest market. \n\"We can't choose, and we will never choose [between China and the US],\" Malaysia's trade minister Tengku Zafrul Aziz told the BBC on Tuesday, ahead of Xi's visit.\n\"If the issue is about something that we feel is against our interest, then we will protect [ourselves].\"\nIn the days after Trump unveiled his sweeping tariffs, South East Asian governments scrambled into deal-making mode.\nIn what Trump described as a \"very productive call\" with Vietnamese leader To Lam, the latter offered to completely scrap tariffs on US goods. \nThe US market is crucial to Vietnam, an emerging electronics powerhouse where manufacturing giants like Samsung, Intel and Foxconn, the Taiwanese firm contracted to make iPhones, have set up shop.\nMeanwhile, Thai officials are headed to Washington with a plan that includes higher US imports and investments. The US is their largest export market, so they are hoping to avoid the 36% levy on Thailand that Trump may reinstate.\n\"We will tell the US government that Thailand is not only an exporter but also an ally and economic partner that the US can rely on in the long term,\" Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra said.\nThe Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) has ruled out retaliation against Trump's tariffs, instead choosing to emphasise their economic and political importance to the US.\n\"We understand the concerns of the US,\" Mr Zafrul told the BBC. \"That's why we need to show that actually we, Asean, especially Malaysia, can be that bridge.\"\nIt's a role that South East Asia's export-driven economies have played well - they have benefitted from both Chinese and US trade and investment. But Trump's paused levies could derail that. \nIndonesia, which could face 32% tariffs, is home to vast nickel reserves and has its sights set on the global electric vehicle supply chain. Malaysia, which is gearing up to be a semiconductor hub, could be hit with 24% tariffs.\nCambodia, a Chinese ally, faces the steepest levies: 49%. One of the poorest countries in the region, it has thrived as a trans-shipment hub for Chinese businesses seeking to skirt US tariffs. Chinese businesses currently own or operate 90% of the clothes factories, which mainly export to the US.\nTrump may have hit pause on these tariffs but \"the damage is done,\" says Doris Liew, an economist at Malaysia's Institute for Democracy and Economic Affairs.\n\"This serves as a wake-up call for the region, not only to reduce reliance on the US, but also to re-balance overdependence on any single trade and export partner.\"\nIn these uncertain times , Xi Jinping is tyring to send a steadfast message: Let's join hands and resist \"bullying\" from the US.\nThat is no easy task because South East Asia also has trade tensions with Beijing. \nIn Indonesia, business owner Isma Savitri is worried that Trump's 145% tariffs on China means more competition from Chinese rivals who can no longer export to the US. \n\"Small businesses like us feel squeezed,\" says the owner of sleepwear brand Helopopy. \"We are struggling to survive against an onslaught of ultra-cheap Chinese products.\"\nOne of Helopopy's popular pyjamas sells for $7.10 (119,000 Indonesian rupiah). Isma says she has seen similar designs from China going for around half that price.\n\"South East Asia, being close by, with open trade regimes and fast-growing markets, naturally became the dumping ground,\" says Nguyen Khac Giang, visiting fellow at the ISEAS Yusof-Ishak Institute in Singapore. \"Politically, many countries are reluctant to confront Beijing, which adds another layer of vulnerability.\"\nWhile consumers have welcomed competitively-priced Chinese products - from clothes to shoes to phones - thousands of local businesses have not been able to match such low prices.\nMore than 100 factories in Thailand have closed every month for the last two years, according to an estimate from a Thai think tank. During the same period in Indonesia, around 250,000 textile workers were laid off after some 60 garment manufacturers shut, local trade associations say - including Sritex, once the region's largest textile maker.\n\"When we see the news, there are lots of imported products flooding the domestic market, which messes up our own market,\" Mujiati, a worker who was laid off from Sritex in February after 30 years, tells the BBC.\n\"Maybe it just wasn't our luck,\" says the 50-year-old, who is still hunting for work. \"Who can we complain to? There's no-one.\"\nSouth East Asian governments responded with a wave of protectionism, as local businesses demanded to be shielded from the impact of Chinese imports.\nLast year Indonesia considered 200% tariffs on a range of Chinese goods and blocked e-commerce site Temu, popular among Chinese merchants. Thailand tightened inspections of imports and imposed additional tax on goods worth less than 1,500 Thai baht ($45; PS34).\nThis year Vietnam has twice imposed temporary anti-dumping duties on Chinese steel products. And after Trump's latest tariffs announcement, Vietnam is reportedly set to crack down on Chinese goods being trans-shipped via its territory to the US.\nAllaying these fears would have been on Xi's agenda this week. \nChina is concerned that channelling its US-bound exports to the rest of the world would \"end up really alienating and aggravating\" its trading partners, David Rennie, the former Beijing bureau chief for the Economist newspaper, told BBC's Newshour.\n\"If a tidal wave of Chinese exports ends up swamping those markets and damaging employment and jobs ... that's a massive diplomatic and geopolitical headache for the Chinese leadership.\"\nChina has not always had an easy relationship with this region. Barring Laos, Cambodia and a war-torn Myanmar, the others are wary of Beijing's ambitions. Terrirorial disputes in the South China have soured ties with the Philippines. This is also an issue with others such as Vietnam and Malaysia, but trade has been a balancing factor. \nBut that might change now, experts say. \n\"South East Asia had to think about whether they really wanted to offend China. Now this complicates things,\" says Chong Ja-Ian, associate professor at the National University of Singapore. \nChina's loss could be South East Asia's gain. \nHao Le, in Vietnam, says he has seen a surge in enquiries from American customers scouting for new electronics suppliers, outside of China: \"In the past, US buyers would take months to switch suppliers. Today, such decisions are made within days.\"\nMalaysia, with sprawling rubber plantations and the world's largest medical rubber glove maker, has nearly half the world's market for rubber gloves. But it is poised to grab a bigger share from its main competitor, China. \nThe region still faces a 10% baseline tariff, like most of the world. And that is bad news, says Oon Kim Hung, president of the Malaysian Rubber Glove Manufacturers Association. \nBut even if the paused tariffs kick in, he says, customers will find paying an additional 24% on Malaysian gloves vastly preferable to the 145% levy they will jave to cough up for Chinese-made gloves.\n\"We're not exactly jumping with joy, but this may well benefit our manufacturers, as well as those in Thailand, Vietnam and Cambodia.\"\nAdditional reporting by Bui Thu and Tessa Wong\nChina is encouraging it's retirees to spend their savings on fun initiatives to help boost its economy, as the country's trade war with the US rages on.\nA new initiative aims to boost the local economy by attracting elderly travellers to remote parts of the country.\nAs the trade war continues to escalate, China has hit back at Trump by suspending exports of rare earth minerals.\nBBC Verify's Jake Horton looks into the truth behind the claims, and what we know about how luxury goods are made.\nThe shift comes as Beijing refuses to back down in an escalating trade war with Washington.\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

      "content": "Claire Jones in Washington\nPublishedApril 17 2025\nYour guide to what the 2024 US election means for Washington and the world\nDonald Trump's claim on Thursday that he has the right to fire Federal Reserve chair Jay Powell has thrust a precedent that has protected independent government agencies for the past nine decades into the spotlight.\nThe president on Thursday attacked Powell, saying \"he's always too late, a little slow. And I'm not happy with him.\" When asked by a reporter in the Oval Office whether he would sack the US's top central banker, Trump said: \"If I want him out, he'll be out real fast, believe me.\" \nTrump's offensive has left investors and economists focused on a case now winding its way through the US courts, which involves his earlier firing of board members at another two independent agencies.\nThe two officials are far lower profile than Powell, but they were protected by the same 1935 Supreme Court precedent known as Humphrey's Executor. \nPowell said on Wednesday that the Fed was \"monitoring\" the case, which centres on Trump's dismissal of Gwynne Wilcox of the National Labor Relations Board and Cathy Harris, Merit Systems Protection Board chair, \"carefully\".\nThe case will test a Supreme Court decision, Humphrey's Executor vs United States, made 90 years ago, which saw the top US court rule in favour of William Humphrey, a former head of the Federal Trade Commission, over president Franklin D Roosevelt's decision to remove him in 1933 due to the commissioner's opposition to New Deal policies.\nAfter Humphrey died, his executor pursued the case to recoup the wages due to his estate, with the Supreme Court deciding that Roosevelt had acted illegally by firing the commissioner without \"cause\" -- a term widely interpreted to cover illegal activities or gross incompetence.\nSince then, the ruling has allowed independent agencies -- including the Fed -- to deflect political pressure when making policy decisions. \nPowell, who intends to serve his full term as chair, which runs until May 2026, on Wednesday said the US central bank's independence to set interest rates as it sees fit was \"a matter of law\". \nThe ruling is the biggest legal guardrail preventing Trump from firing Powell or his six fellow Fed governors.\nDavid Wilcox, a former Fed economist now at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said Humphrey's Executor has become so important in shaping people's perceptions of the Fed's independence that any challenge to it would likely trigger panic.\n\"The mere empowerment of the president to exercise this ability to fire governors would unnerve market participants, would undermine Federal Reserve credibility in the eyes of investors,\" said Wilcox. \"We might get a rather severe adverse market reaction to a Supreme Court decision along those lines.\"\nWilcox and Harris, Biden administration appointees, were both fired after Trump became president in January. They brought cases against the government in federal courts, which ordered them reinstated.\nThe Trump administration later appealed to the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, which on April 7 backed the lower courts' decision to reinstate Wilcox and Harris. The DC Circuit specifically cited the Humphrey's Executor precedent in its decision.\nThe US then appealed to the Supreme Court to reverse the lower courts' order to reinstate Wilcox and Harris. \nChief justice John Roberts on April 9 issued an order that prevents Wilcox and Harris from returning to work while the Supreme Court considers the case. The Supreme Court could decide on the appeal in the coming days. It had required parties to respond to the appeal by April 15. \nLev Menand, a legal scholar at Columbia University, described the circumstances of the case as \"extremely rare\", arguing that if the Supreme Court continues to deny the women the right to return to work, then people would probably view Humphrey's Executor as \"doomed\".\n\"Even though maybe the court in the end will uphold [Humphrey's Executor] some months from now and put these people back in their jobs, if the court agrees with the government and they get kicked out of their job in the interim period, then, in and of itself, it's a partial victory for Trump. Even if he loses the case in the end.\"\nSome legal scholars say the reason Humphrey's Executor has remained in place for so long is that Supreme Court justices recognise the importance of having an independent US central bank -- including conservatives Brett Kavanaugh and Samuel Alito, based on earlier judgments.\nLast year, the justices voted 7-2 in a decision that was seen as a measure of the legal support for the Fed's independence, even though it was officially about the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Even Alito, who voted against the funding mechanism for the CFPB, noted in his dissent that the Fed was a \"unique institution with a unique historical background\" that made it special.\nThe scholars argue that even if the Supreme Court ends up siding with Trump in the cases of Wilcox and Harris, its judgment could include a carve-out that would insulate Fed governors from political pressure.\n\"The very first Congress, convening right after the Constitution was ratified, created the First Bank of the United States,\" said Daniel Tarullo, a professor at Harvard Law School who was formerly a Fed governor.\nRecommended\n\"Although the charters of the First and Second Banks were eventually not renewed, their creation set a precedent for an early version of a central bank that was, if anything, more independent of the president than today's Federal Reserve.\"\nPowell, who is a lawyer, said on Wednesday that any decision on the case would not \"apply to the Fed\". \n\"Generally speaking, Fed independence is very widely understood and supported in Washington, in Congress, where it really matters,\" Powell added. \nAdditional reporting by Stefania Palma and Joe Miller",
      "ml_hf_summary": "Donald Trump's public criticism of Federal Reserve Chair Jay Powell has reignited a legal battle over the independence of independent government agencies.  Trump stated his intention to remove Powell if he deemed fit, citing \"slowness\" in policy decisions. This claim is based on a precedent established by Humphrey’s Executor, which protects independent agencies from political pressure when making policy decisions. The case involves Trump's earlier firing of board members at other agencies and is currently being reviewed by the Supreme Court.  The court will decide whether to uphold the precedent set by Humphrey’s Executor or allow for greater presidential control over these agencies. This legal battle has significant implications for market stability, as it could impact investor confidence in the US central bank's independence. \n"

In January, the IMF predicted a 3.3 per cent expansion in both 2025 and 2026, with the global economy boosted by the expectation of strong growth in the US. \nAfter Trump surprised markets with a far more aggressive trade policy than expected, many analysts downgraded their forecasts, with some now seeing a significant risk of a recession in the world's largest economy.\nThe Peterson Institute for International Economics said earlier this week that the US economy would grow by just 0.1 per cent -- down from 2.5 per cent in 2024. \nGeorgieva said the Trump administration's tariffs were a response to an \"erosion of trust\", triggered in part by more economic subsidies for exporters in some of the US's biggest trading partners, including China and the EU. \nWashington has also provided manufacturing subsidies through measures such as former president Joe Biden's Inflation Reduction Act, which gave tax breaks for producing green tech in the US. \nBoth Trump and Biden have highlighted Beijing's massive state support of its manufacturing industries as a problem for America. Trump has threatened Brussels with 20 per cent tariffs, while China faces levies of 145 per cent.\nGeorgieva also warned that continuing uncertainty over trade policies risked creating more episodes of financial market stress, such as the sell-off last week when equity markets fell sharply and the US government's borrowing costs rose. \nThe IMF managing director described the movements in markets, which also saw the US currency drop, as \"unusual\". \nRecommended\n\"Despite elevated uncertainty, the dollar depreciated, and US Treasury yield curves 'smiled' -- it is not the sort of smile one wants to see,\" she said, adding that the movements \"should be taken as a warning\". \nThe fall in the dollar amid the market panic has led some to question whether its status as the global reserve currency is under threat. \n\"Something that's this well entrenched, that benefits from such strong network effects, there's reason to be sceptical about a rapid unravelling [of the dollar's status],\" said Brent Neiman, a former US Treasury official under the Biden Administration who is now a professor at the University of Chicago. \n\"But major changes about the extent to which the US is considered a place of stable policies and reliable commitment to rules and the current order could certainly have an impact.\"",

Kristalina Georgieva, IMF Managing Director, stated that these tariffs are likely to push prices up and potentially disrupt financial markets. The IMF expects to revise its forecasts for price pressures upward but will not predict a recession due to the tariffs.  The World Bank has urged governments to engage in dialogue and negotiation to reduce the tariffs announced by President Trump. The IMF's latest World Economic Outlook, expected next week, will reflect these revisions. \n"

Trump's post also said the Fed should be cutting interest rates and called a recent Powell speech about the economy a \"complete mess.\"\nTrump expanded in a later press appearance that reflected how the Fed's decisions could weigh on the president's fortunes.\nInterest rates on home mortgages and other consumer credit remain high, for example, and the Fed is likely to offer little relief now that inflation risks are rising in the wake of Trump's tariff plans.\n\"The Fed really owes it to the American people to get interest rates down. That's the only thing he's good for,\" Trump said.\n\"I am not happy with him. If I want him out of there he'll be out real fast believe me.\"\nTrump's pointed remarks about Powell echo the sometimes intense language used against the Fed chair in Trump's first term. It pushes into an issue with the potential to rock global markets if the president tries to fire Powell because he disagrees about his monetary policy decisions.\nIndeed, Trump has privately discussed firing Powell for months and talked about it with former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh, including the possibility of then selecting Warsh as Powell's replacement, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing unnamed people familiar with the matter.\nWarsh for his part has advised against trying to fire Powell, arguing that Trump should let the Fed chair complete his term without interference, the report said.\nIt is not clear Trump has the power to remove Powell, who is appointed by the president but confirmed by the Senate. An effort by Trump to remove members of other independent agencies is currently before the Supreme Court, but Powell on Wednesday said he felt the case would not change the Fed's longstanding independence in monetary policy, something that has broad bipartisan support.\nContrary to Trump's assertion that Powell would leave if asked, Powell, a former private equity investor with enough independent wealth to fund his own legal challenge, has said he had no plans to vacate the job before his term ends in May of next year.\nTrump's blow-up at Powell was sensitive enough, Politico said in a report citing unnamed sources, that Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has been cautioning White House officials against attempting to fire Powell, saying it would risk destabilising financial markets.\nSign up for our emails\nFind out More\n(c) West Australian Newspapers Limited 2025",

It claims there is no shortage of aid because 25,000 lorry loads of supplies entered during the ceasefire.\nThe war began on 7 October 2023 when Hamas carried out a cross-border attack on Israeli communities, killing around 1,200 people and seizing 251 hostages according to Israeli tallies.\nIsrael's military campaign against Hamas has killed at least 51,065 people, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.\nThe group says it lost communication after an Israeli strike on where Edan Alexander was being held.\nThe plan also gives no commitment to end the war in return for hostages, a Palestinian official says.\nThe agency says it is seeing \"attack after attack\" and supply shortages following an Israeli strike on al-Ahli hospital.\nAsaad al-Nassasra has been missing since Israeli troops killed 15 other emergency workers in south Gaza three weeks ago.\nDonald Trump has suggested Iran could face military action if it does not agree to a new nuclear deal. \nCopyright 2025 BBC.

But most cannot afford to buy there because of spiralling prices and widespread shortages, meaning humanitarian aid is the primary food source for 80% of the population, the World Food Program said in its monthly report for April on Gaza's markets.\n \"The Gaza Strip is now likely facing the worst humanitarian crisis in the 18 months since the escalation of hostilities in October 2023,\" OCHA said.\nMeanwhile, two Hamas officials told AFP Thursday that the group's discussions on an Israeli truce proposal were nearly complete, with a response expected soon.\n\"These talks are almost complete, and the group will send its response to the mediators once they finish. It's expected the talks will wrap up soon - possibly even today,\" an official said, with another member of the group confirming his account.\nHamas said Israel had proposed a new 45-day ceasefire through mediators that would include the release of dozens of hostages.\nThe proposal also called for Hamas to disarm to secure a complete end to the war, a demand the group rejects.\nHowever, a ceasefire agreement still looks distant, as divisions persist between the two sides.\nEfforts by mediators from Egypt, Qatar and the US to restore the collapsed ceasefire in Gaza and return the hostages have continued to hit stumbling blocks.\nKatz said that no matter what deal was agreed, Israeli troops would remain in the buffer zones it had occupied in Gaza, as well as in neighbouring Syria and Lebanon.\nIsrael's renewed assault has so far killed at least 1,691 people in Gaza, the health ministry in the Hamas-run territory reported, bringing the overall toll since the war erupted to 51,065, most of them civilians.\nHamas's October 2023 attack on Israel resulted in the deaths of 1,218 people, also mostly civilians.\nAFP, AP and Reuters contributed to this report",

      "content": "The case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia - a 29-year-old from El Salvador who was deported from the US in March - has prompted a legal showdown over the administration's immigration policy.\nJudges all the way up to the US Supreme Court have ruled that Mr Abrego Garcia was deported in error and that the US government should help \"facilitate\" his return to his home in Maryland.\nBut the White House has accused Mr Abrego Garcia of being a member of the transnational Salvadorian gang MS-13, a designated foreign terrorist organisation, saying that he will \"will never live\" in the US again.\nMr Abrego Garcia denies he is a member of the gang and he has not been convicted of any crime. \nBBC Verify has examined court documents and public records to determine what's known - and what is still unknown - about Mr Abrego Garcia and his alleged ties to MS-13.\nMr Abrego Garcia has acknowledged entering the US illegally in 2012, according to court documents.\nIn March 2019 he was detained along with three other people in Hyattsville, Maryland, in the car park of a Home Depot.\nOfficers at the Prince George's County Police Department said the men were \"loitering\" and subsequently identified Mr Abrego Garcia and two of the others as members of MS-13.\nIn a document titled the \"Gang Field Interview Sheet\", the local police detailed their observations.\nThey said Mr Abrego Garcia was wearing a \"Chicago Bulls hat and a hoodie with rolls of money covering the eyes, ears and mouth of the presidents on the separate denominations\".\nOfficers claimed the clothing was \"indicative of the Hispanic gang culture\" and that \"wearing the Chicago Bulls hat represents thay (sic) they are a member in good standing with the MS-13\".\nSteven Dudley, a journalist and author who has spent years studying the MS-13 gang, said that it is true that \"at some point, the Chicago Bulls logo with the horns became a stand-in of sorts for the MS-13's devil horns symbol\".\nBut wearing the logo of the hugely popular basketball team, he added, is of course not exclusive to the gang.\n\"Any assertions about gang affiliation would need to be corroborated with testimony, criminal history, and other corroborating evidence,\" Mr Dudley said.\nAccording to the field interview sheet and other court documents, officers said they were also advised by a \"proven and reliable source\" that Mr Abrego Garcia was an active member of MS-13's \"westerns clique\", with the rank of \"chequeo\".\nHowever, Mr Dudley says that a \"chequeo\" is not a rank but is instead used to refer to recruits who are yet to be initiated.\nLawyers for Mr Abrego Garcia's argued in court filings that the \"westerns clique\" is based in New York, where they say their client has never lived. And according to government documents, he has dismissed the information given to police against him as \"hearsay\".\nAccording to his lawyers, Mr Abrego Garcia has never been convicted of any criminal offence, including gang membership, in the US or in El Salvador. He lived in the US for 14 years, had three children and worked in construction, according to court records.\nBut the judge who presided over his 2019 case said that based on the confidential information, there was sufficient evidence to support Mr Abrego Garcia's gang membership. That finding was later upheld by another judge.\nAs a result Mr Abrego Garcia was refused bail and remained in custody. During this time he applied for asylum to prevent his deportation to El Salvador.\nIn October 2019 he was granted a \"withholding of removal\" order, court documents show - a status different from asylum, but one which prevented the US government from sending him back to El Salvador because he could face harm.\nMr Abrego Garcia's lawyers say that he was granted the status based on his \"well-founded\" fear of persecution by Barrio-18, the main rival gang of MS-13.\nHe said that prior to him entering the US, his family and their business had been threatened and extorted by Barrio-18.\nSince 2019, when he was released with the protective order, Mr Abrego Garcia's lawyers say he has had yearly check-ins with immigration officials, which he has attended \"without fail and without incident\".\nMr Abrego Garcia has faced at least two other allegations of criminal activity, neither of which resulted in a conviction.\nIn 2021, his wife, Jennifer Vasquez Sura, filed a protective order petition against him, alleging that he had physically attacked her on multiple occasions, according to documents shared by the US Department of Homeland Security.\nMs Vasquez Sura said in a statement on 16 April that she had decided not to follow through with the court process at the time and that she and her husband \"were able to work through this situation privately as a family, including by going to counseling\".\nShe described her husband as \"a loving partner and father\" and has repeatedly denied he is an MS-13 gang member.\nOn 15 April, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt also accused Mr Abrego Garcia of involvement in human trafficking.\nShe appeared to be referencing a report in the The Tennessee Star, a conservative news website, which said Mr Abrego Garcia was detained by a Tennessee highway patrol officer on suspicion of human trafficking in December 2022 while driving a vehicle carrying seven passengers.\nThe report, which cited unnamed sources, said officers contacted the FBI and later released him and the passengers.\nThe BBC has not independently verified the report and has contacted both Tennessee authorities and the FBI for comment, as well as Mr Abrego Garcia's lawyers.\nWhat do you want BBC Verify to investigate?\nEarlier this year, King Charles III invited Donald Trump for an unprecedented second state visit.\nThe alleged gunman is a 20-year-old student whose mother, a sheriff's deputy, owns the gun used, police say.\nIt is the second major case Google has lost in a year, after it was found to have a monopoly on online search.\nThe pause is a major blow to the US's wind energy industry which has been targeted by President Trump.\nThe pair hope to take a step towards release - decades after killing their parents in a high-profile US case.\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

CSD asks, 'Whose side are they on?'\nA federal appeals court on Thursday denied the Trump administration's emergency request to block a judge's order requiring the U.S. government to return Kilmar Abrego Garcia, an illegal immigrant from El Salvador with a violent criminal history and alleged gang ties, who was deported to the El Salvadoran mega prison \"Terrorism Confinement Center\" (CECOT) last month.\nThe ruling allows the lower court's order to move forward for now.\nThe case involves Garcia, a \"Maryland man\" who was deported but whose return was ordered by a district judge after a recent Supreme Court decision.

      "summary": "The Trump administration is headed on a collision course with the judicial branch, a rare and historic scenario.",
      "content": "A US federal judge has given President Donald Trump's officials a one-week deadline to comply with his court order or risk being found in contempt of court - potentially setting up a historic clash between two equally powerful branches of government.\nJudge James Boasberg said the \"most obvious way\" for the officials to avoid contempt was to \"assert custody\" over a group of more than 200 people who they deported to El Salvador last month - after he told them not to do so. \nBut the Trump administration has shown no sign of a desire to adhere, criticising Wednesday's request and saying it would appeal. \nThe White House denies any wrongdoing, and has depicted the group as \"terrorists and criminal illegal migrants\" who threaten American society.\nExperts have told the BBC that a showdown between the judicial and executive branch appears all but inevitable. So, what might happen if the government does not comply with Judge Boasberg's deadline of 23 April? \nThe first step to hold any Trump officials in contempt of court would be to determine who was responsible for the non-compliance, an expert told the BBC.\nAt the moment, it remains unclear who took the specific actions against Judge's Boasberg's initial order to not deport people to El Salvador, said Robert Tsai, a Boston University constitutional law professor.\nLawyers would use a process called discovery to decide who was responsible, by seeking documents and questioning government officials under oath.\n\"You want to be able to nail someone down and pinpoint who it is that's basically saying, 'We're getting the planes up in the air, and just stonewall the judge,'\" Prof Tsai said.\nGovernment lawyers have said the planes were already en route by the time Judge Boasberg's written order was issued, and that his subsequent verbal order for the planes to return happened when they were no longer in US airspace. \nIf he felt government lawyers were not playing ball, Judge Boasberg could fine both the lawyers and other government officials until they complied, Prof Tsai said. The sanctions or penalties would apply until the government met the terms of the judge's order. \nAll of this falls under the umbrella of civil contempt. \n There is also the possibility of Trump administration officials being found in criminal contempt - for which the punishment could include jail time. \n\"That's considered one of the most serious things, and usually the last resort,\" Prof Tsai said. \nIn the case of criminal contempt, Prof Tsai said the normal course of events would be to refer the issue for prosecution by the justice department, which is run by Attorney General Pam Bondi. \nJudge Boasberg also has the power to appoint a special prosecutor to pursue criminal contempt charges and to sidestep Bondi, a Trump loyalist who was appointed by the president.\n\"With this administration, it is very possible that the justice department refuses to prosecute,\" George Mason University law professor Ilya Somin explained to the BBC. \nEven if the justice department does take the case, Trump has the power to pardon a criminal offence. But the president does not have the power to issue pardons for civil liability (civil contempt).\nThe ruling from US District Judge James E Boasberg on Wednesday said the government showed \"wilful disregard\" for his order when it sent planes carrying alleged criminals to El Salvador - after he had barred the government from using a wartime law for the deportations. \nThat law, the 1798 Alien Enemies Act, gave the Trump administration power to expedite its deportation of those it said were gang members without providing any evidence.\nThe US Supreme Court later ruled that Trump was able to use the wartime law, Judge Boasberg said on Wednesday that \"does not excuse the government's violation\" of his earlier request.\nTo avoid contempt proceedings, the judge gave the administration two options - to \"purge\" itself of contempt, or to remedy its noncompliance.\n\"The most obvious way\", he said, was for the administration to \"assert custody\" of the hundreds deported to El Salvador's mega-prison, so they could \"challenge their removability\". \nJudge Boasberg said the government would not need to release any of those deported - a number of whom have not been convicted of any crimes - nor fly them back to the US.\nThe judge said the administration could also \"propose other methods of coming into compliance\". \nThe high-stakes collision between a federal judge and the Trump administration comes under a president whose stated goal was to enact the \"largest deportation programme\" in US history. \nIf any officials are found in contempt, regardless of Trump's possible involvement, it is unlikely that the president himself would ever be criminally charged, Prof Tsai said, thanks to the Supreme Court's presidential immunity ruling last year.\n\"I think that the presidential immunity decision that was issued is going to be the thing that protects him from any kind of criminal prosecution,\" Prof Tsai explained. \n\"All these orders are sort of policy decisions. They might be illegal, they might be unconstitutional, who knows. \n\"But even if they are, they're done within the scope of his his core powers,\" he said. \n One person was taken into custody after the shooting on Thursday, according to CBS News, the BBC's US partner.\nThe pair hope to take a step towards release - decades after killing their parents in a high-profile US case.\nBBC Verify looks at the evidence behind allegations that the Salvadoran mistakenly deported to a mega-prison was a dangerous gang member.\nIt is the second major case Google has lost in a year, after it was found to have a monopoly on online search.\nA Kremlin spokesman dismissed the talks between Ukraine, Europe and the US, which took place in Paris.\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

CREW has been tracking the administration's actions and sued over its firing of federal workers.\n\"It's supposed to be a charitable organization,\" Trump said of CREW. \"The only charity they had is going after Donald Trump. So we're looking at that. We're looking at a lot of things.\"\nTrump appears to have changed his mind on taking the US through a lengthy trade war. After weeks of strong rhetoric, the president told reporters in the Oval Office on Thursday that he thought trade deals could be finished in the \"next three or four weeks\".\nFrom the Associated Press:\nThat timeline would be ambitious, as Trump's tariffs have sent nations scrambling to Washington. Yet it's still unclear what he wants, and he still seems committed to imposing tariffs.\nTrump has indicated that tariff rates can change, but he said his biggest limitation is that \"there's only so many hours in the day.\"\nThe president's timeline was about making a deal with China and \"everybody.\"\nTrump targeted protected areas of the Pacific with two orders Thursday, in a move he claims increases competitiveness of the commercial fishing.\nIn a proclamation, he removed fishing regulations in the Pacific Remote Islands Marine National Monument, an area known to have \"some of the most pristine coral reef ecosystems in the Pacific Ocean,\" according to a description from NOAA Fisheries. The incredibly biodiverse area supports a range of marine mammals, seabirds, and \"vegetation not found anywhere else in the world,\" including many threatened and endangered species.\n\"President Trump believes that removing unnecessary restrictions on American fishermen will strengthen the U.S. economy, support local communities, and restore fairness to an industry disadvantaged by overregulation and foreign competition,\" a fact sheet on the order said.\nThe other order, which specifically focuses on American seafood competitiveness, directs the Secretary of Commerce to \"consider suspending, revising, or rescinding regulations that overly burden America's commercial fishing, aquaculture, and fish processing industries,\" and the National Marine Fisheries Service to expand permit programs. The order also calls for officials to review all marine national monuments to \"assess opening them to commercial fishing\".\nIn their unanimous opinion issued today, a US appeals court warned the Trump administration that battles against the judiciary could undermine public confidence, Reuters reported.\nPart of the fourth US circuit court of appeals, the three-judge panel said the executive branch and the courts were \"grinding irrevocably against one another in a conflict that promises to diminish both.\"\nThe strongly worded unanimous opinion came as the panel denied Trump's appeal to stop an order from a federal judge who is seeking more detail on whether the administration took any steps to return Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a request the court said was \"shocking\". \n \"We yet cling to the hope that it is not naive to believe our good brethren in the Executive Branch perceive the rule of law as vital to the American ethos,\" wrote US circuit judge J Harvie Wilkinson, who was appointed by Republican president Ronald Reagan. \"This case presents their unique chance to vindicate that value and to summon the best that is within us while there is still time.\"\nThe Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is reportedly planning to revoke Harvard University's tax-exempt status in what would be a probably illegal move amid Donald Trump's concerted attack on the independence of US institutions of higher education. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said late on Wednesday that Harvard would lose its ability to enrol foreign students if it did not meet demands the Trump administration demands to share information on some visa holders.\nA US appeals court denied the Trump administration's request for a stay of Judge Paula Xinis' order in the case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, the Maryland man wrongly deported to El Salvador. The court described the administration's request as \"shocking\".\nCory Booker, a Democratic senator from New Jersey, reportedly plans to travel to El Salvador, as Democrats seek to pressure the Trump administration to return Abrego Garcia. Maryland senator Chris Van Hollen, who traveled to El Salvador this week, said he attempted to drive to the prison where his Maryland constituent is being held, but was stopped by the military at a checkpoint.\nDonald Trump condemned the Federal Reserve chair, Jerome Powell, for not lowering US interest rates, and expressed a wish for him to be gone from his role. Trump claimed Powell would resign if he asked him to. Powell himself has said that he would not resign if asked to do so by the president.\nItalian prime minister Giorgia Meloni said Trump had accepted her invitation for an official trip to Rome, as the pair met in Washington in an attempt by Meloni to bridge the gap between the EU and US amid trade tariff tensions.\nThe supreme court said it will hear arguments next month over Trump's bid to broadly enforce his executive order to restrict automatic birthright citizenship.

The supreme court has ordered the government to \"facilitate\" his return to the United States, but Donald Trump has refused to do so.\nVan Hollen arrived in El Salvador yesterday intending to meet Abrego Garcia and report on his well-being to his family. The senator met with vice-president Felix Ulloa, who refused his request to see the deportee in person, or speak to him on the phone.\nThe senator said he attempted today to drive to the Terrorism Confinement Center (Cecot), where Abrego Garcia is being held.\nVan Hollen said in a video filmed on the side of a road:\nI understand we're about three kilometers now from Cecot, and as you can see, they're letting other cars go by, but they stopped us because they're under orders not to allow us to proceed to check on the well being of Kilmar Abrego Garcia.\nYou can watch it here. Here's more on Van Hollen's attempt to visit Abrego Garcia.\nTrump said he had been \"fully briefed\" on the mass shooting at Florida State University, which has reportedly resulted in multiple casualties.\n\"It's a horrible thing. It's horrible that things like this take place,\" he said.",

But it's not the same for the people who are working here.\" \nRodrigo Padilla is a journalist in Tenerife and was at a protest supporting his mother who works as a waitress.\nHe said the issue was with both pay and conditions. \n\"My mother leaves the house at 6am and it takes three or four hours to get to work and the same after her shift.\"\nThe industrial action comes after a series of protests last year in the Canary Islands and Spanish mainland over mass tourism.\nLocals say tourism has pushed up housing costs beyond a sustainable level for people to live on the islands.\nThey stress they are not against the tourism industry, which makes up 35% of the Canaries' economy, but there was a need for a more sustainable model that factored in environmental impacts such as water shortages and which puts less pressure on costs and housing.\nPolice suspect the range was used by a weapons trafficking ring to test assault rifles and other arms.\nCitizens from Kosovo, Bangladesh, Colombia, Egypt, India, Morocco and Tunisia would all have their claims fast-tracked.\nThe Spanish architect was a devout Catholic and is best known for Barcelona's Sagrada Familia basilica.\nThe couple is suspected of selling exotic cats online, including protected species such as white tigers.\nStephen Howd, from Farnham, died in Tenerife in April 2023 after jumping from rocks into the sea.\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

      "content": "The US embassy in Zambia has warned its citizens to be wary of a new \"intrusive\" cyber-security law introduced in the southern African country.\nThe embassy issued an alert telling Americans \"in or planning to visit Zambia of a new law that requires the interception and surveillance of all electronic communications in the country\".\nThis includes calls, emails, texts and streamed content \"in-country to assess if they include any transmission of 'critical information,' a term the law defines so broadly that it could apply to almost any activity\", the embassy says.\nZambia's government said the law was needed to tackle online fraud and child pornography, as well as the spread of disinformation.\nFollowing the alert from the US embassy, Zambia's foreign ministry released a statement saying that the new Cyber Security Act was \"not intended to invade any person's privacy\" - whether Zambians or foreigners. \n\"The Law does not authorize mass or random surveillance. Any interception or data request requires a court-issued warrant,\" it said.\nThe statement added that the \"classification of 'critical information'\" referred to national security, \"and any assessments or actions taken are carried out by authorized institutions, in line with due process\".\nThere are fears that the law could be use against anyone who criticises the government, especially with elections due next year.\nSome Zambians have expressed concern that a new cyber-security unit is being set up in the president's office.\nJoan Chirwa, founder of the Free Press Initiative Zambia campaign group, told the BBC \"it was a sad day for Zambia\".\nShe said the law wouldn't \"just affect journalists, or civil society organisations. It will affect everyone in Zambia\".\nThe new measure empowers a law enforcement officer with a warrant to enter any premises to search and seize a computer or computer system containing material that is either evidence necessary to prove an offence or acquired by a person as a result of an offence.\nIt also allows the government to extradite Zambians deemed to have committed any offence under the law, with a range of jail terms prescribed.\nOffenders may be fined or jailed for between five and 15 years, depending on the crime they have committed.\nAmong other provisions, the legislation requires Information and Communication Technology (ICT) companies to proactively intercept all electronic communications.\nIt was signed into law by President Hakainde Hichilema on 8 April with very little publicity and the first many Zambians knew about it was when the US embassy posted its alert on Facebook.\n\"As this new law introduces an intrusive surveillance ecosystem significantly different from privacy protection provisions that prevail in many countries, the embassy of the United States encourages Americans living in Zambia or considering visiting the country to carefully assess the implications of this law and adjust accordingly,\" the US statement said.\nThe alert came as a surprise to many as the US has widely been seen to enjoy a warm relationship with the Hichilema-led administration, although the ambassador has recently been critical of alleged corruption in the government.\nZambia had enjoyed a frosty relationship with the US after the former government expelled its pro-gay rights ambassador Daniel Foote in 2019 but relations had improved since Hichilema was elected in 2021.\nSocial commentator and civil rights activist Laura Miti accused the US embassy of \"hypocrisy\", while also labelling the new law \"tyrannical\".\n\"Until Edward Snowden revealed the matter, the US secretly surveilled its citizens for years. He remains in exile and one of the most wanted people by American law enforcement,\" she wrote on Facebook. \"That raises an eyebrow about this from the American embassy. Hypocritical really.\"\nHowever, she also condemned the new law.\n\"This... is a very tyrannical law which the government only needs because it feels insecure.\"\nIn 2021, while still in opposition, Hichilema opposed a similar law when the former government wanted to pass it, writing: \"The Cyber Security and Crime Bill is not about preventing cyber-bullying. It is about clamping down on freedom of expression and spying on citizens.\"\nOpposition lawmaker Miles Sampa has accused Hichilema of performing a U-turn now that he is president.\n\"My question is when did you change this stance to now sign a law that almost 100% prohibits us citizens from expressing ourselves on Facebook, X, Instagram, TikTok, etc., without being jailed for 25 years or life imprisonment,\" he wrote on Facebook.\n\"In the current state of the Cyber Laws that you have assented to, Mr President, you may as well also sign a martial law (State of Emergency) to discard democracy so we all stop talking and leave it to your good self to express alone.\"\nGo to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent. \n Follow us on Twitter @BBCAfrica, on Facebook at BBC Africa or on Instagram at bbcafrica\nHeavy fighting broke out on Wednesday after al-Shabab raided the town, saying they had captured it. \nHe is the first non-US citizen to be convicted of torture in an American court for crimes committed abroad.\nThe tech billionaire is embroiled in a row with the government over black empowerment legislation.\nThree people died in the \"high-intensity shootout\" that led to Josh Sullivan's rescue, officials say.\nThe country is experiencing the worst humanitarian crisis in the world two years into a bloody civil war.\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

The festival's website also briefly said the event was postponed, according to NBC News.\nThe organisers said in a further update reported by NBC and the New York Times that Fyre 2 was \"still on\".\n\"We are vetting new locations and will announce our host destination soon. Our priorities remain unchanged: delivering an unforgettable, safe, and transparent experience,\" the update said.\nMcFarland told NBC the date is dependent on location.\nBBC News has reached out to Fyre Festival 2 organisers for comment.\nThe uncertainty follows two local governments in Mexico saying they had no planning records for the festival that organisers had said would take place in their areas.\nIn February, organisers announced the festival's location as Isla Mujeres, an island off Cancun.\nHowever, the local city council posted on Facebook that \"no person or company has requested permits from this office or any other Municipal Government department for said event\".\nThe event was re-announced with a new location in Playa del Carmen. Local officials there said on X that \"no event with this name has reached our city\".\n\"Following a responsible review of the situation, it confirms that there is no registration, planning or conditions indicating the realisation of the event in the municipality,\" a translation of the statement read.\nMcFarland and Fyre Festival 2 posted documents on Instagram that they said showed approval for the event. One document indicated permission for 250 people at a venue. McFarland had said 1,800 tickets were for sale.\nTo many, the latest developments will come as little surprise. \nThe original Fyre was promoted by supermodels and celebrities as an exclusive getaway for the ultra-rich, and the location was hyped as a private island once owned by drug lord Pablo Escobar.\nBut festival-goers arrived in the Bahamas to find all the talent cancelled, bare mattresses to sleep on in storm-ravaged tents and cheese sandwiches in takeaway containers to eat.\nMcFarland was sentenced in 2018 to six years in jail for wire fraud, and was also ordered to return $29m to investors.\nHe was freed in 2022 under an early release programme but remains on probation until August.\nLast year, McFarland announced the reboot, saying \"Fyre 2 has to work\".\nHe claimed he had spent a year planning it, and had already sold 100 tickets at an \"early bird\" rate of $499. It is unclear how many tickets have been sold to date.\nNo line-up for the festival has been announced.\nLast year, Andy King, an investor in the first Fyre Festival, issued a warning to anyone interested in going to its planned reboot: \"Proceed with caution.\"\nMr King, who lost $1m in the original debacle, told the BBC that McFarland was \"known for the biggest failure in pop culture and wants to flip the script. But I'm not sure he's going about it the right way.\"\nEarlier this year, King Charles III invited Donald Trump for an unprecedented second state visit.\nThe alleged gunman is a 20-year-old student whose mother, a sheriff's deputy, owns the gun used, police say.\nIt is the second major case Google has lost in a year, after it was found to have a monopoly on online search.\nThe pause is a major blow to the US's wind energy industry which has been targeted by President Trump.\nThe pair hope to take a step towards release - decades after killing their parents in a high-profile US case.\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

      "summary": "The pair hope to take a step towards release - decades after killing their parents in a high-profile US case.",
      "content": "After decades spent in prison by Erik and Lyle Menendez - and months of contentious court fights - a judge is hearing arguments on whether the brothers should be resentenced, in a murder case that still divides America. \nThe pair are serving life in prison for killing their parents, Kitty and Jose Menendez, in 1989, when they were 21 and 18. Their case gained renewed attention after a popular Netflix series last year.\nThursday's resentencing hearing will determine whether the pair should be resentenced to a lesser penalty. If approved, the brothers could become eligible for parole - potentially allowing their freedom. \nProsecutors have argued Erik and Lyle meticulously planned the killings so they could access their parents' fortune. The current Los Angeles District Attorney says the brothers have continued to cling to lies about the case and should not be freed.\nBut the brothers' lawyers have long argued the killings were an act of self-defence and claimed their father abused them for years. They have also pointed to court filings detailing their rehabilitation during their years behind bars. \nHere is what has happened in court so far today - and a recap of how we got here. \nThe brothers shot and killed their parents with shotguns at their Beverly Hills mansion, but there has long been a debate over their motive.\nProsecutors painted them during their trials as spoiled rich kids who wanted to access their parents' $14m (PS10.7m) fortune. They argued that the duo methodically planned the killings, buying shotguns and opening fire on their parents 13 times as the couple watched TV - before going gambling, to parties and on shopping sprees.\nThe brothers ultimately admitted to the killings - but argued they acted out of self-defence after years of emotional, physical and sexual abuse by their father Jose, a high-powered film and record label executive. \nThe brothers' trial in 1993 was one of the first high-profile murder cases to be shown live on television, gripping audiences in the US and globally.\nIt ended deadlocked, but in 1996, the brothers were convicted of first-degree murder in a second trial during which the judge barred many of their claims of sexual abuse. They are imprisoned near San Diego.\nThe hearing on Thursday got a contentious start. \nAttorneys representing the Menendez brothers and the victims' families launched a multi-pronged attack against the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office, which is opposing the resentencing effort. \nThey accused prosecutors of violating victims' rights by displaying graphic crime scene images, discussion of including a risk assessment report being prepared by state parole officials, and creating a conflict of interest on the parole board.\nMark Geragos, a high-profile defence attorney representing the brothers, said he would ask for the district attorney's office to be recused. \nLos Angeles County Superior Court Judge Michael Jesic defended the prosecutor leading the case, Habib Balian, and the prosecutor apologised for not giving the family a notice about the gruesome photos before they were shown. \nThe judge told attorney Bryan Freedman, who representing members of the Menendez family who have been vying for their release, that things will come up in these hearings that will be tough for family members to watch.\n\"If anyone is uncomfortable they need to think about whether they should be here,\" the judge warned.\nAfter a lunch break, the hearing is expected to continue to hearing arguments and testimony. \nThe judge will look at evidence, hear from witnesses, and ultimately determine whether Erik and Lyle should be resentenced. \nIt will not be a re-trial, and guilt will not be a question. Much of the focus is likely to instead be on what the brothers have done during their 30 years in prison. \nThe hearing is not being televised and is scheduled to go into Friday. \nBoth sides - lawyers for the Menendez brothers and the district attorney's office - will be able to call people to testify. \nThis could include a wide variety of individuals, from people involved in prosecuting the brothers in the 1990s or prison officials talking about the brothers' last 30 years behind bars. \nWe are likely to hear from members of the Menendez family, many of whom have become outspoken advocates for Erik and Lyle's release. But at least one member of the family has been a fierce critic of the effort to free them. \nMilton Anderson, who is Kitty Menendez's brother, has called the brothers \"cold-blooded\" and has argued the pair should remain behind bars for the \"heinous act\".\nThe brothers appeared in court on Thursday via a video feed from prison, wearing cobalt blue prison uniforms and matching stern expressions as prosecutors and attorneys haggled over their fate.\nIt is unclear whether they will address the court. \nIf they did, it would mark a significant moment in the case, and would leave them open to questions from prosecutors who oppose their release.\nThe pair have previously only appeared in court remotely by video link. The BBC has asked whether they will appear in person on Friday, and if they will testify. \nOn a recent episode of his podcast, their lawyer Mark Geragos said he had not decided whether to call them to the stand.\n\"I know right now that I'm going to put family members on the stand,\" Mr Geragos said. \"I know right now, I'll put correctional officers on the stand. I know right now I may put behavioural scientists on the stand.\"\nThe district attorney's office has similarly not said who it plans to call to testify. \nAfter the two-day hearing, Judge Jesic will rule on whether the brothers should be resentenced. \nBut it is not clear when that will happen, though it appears it will not come this week. \nThe judge addressed his timing on a decision at Thursday's hearing. \n\"There's no way I'm going to make a decision in the next two days to resentence,\" he told both sides. \nEven if Judge Jesic rules in favour of the brothers being resentenced, they will not be immediately released. \nWhat happens next will depend on what type of sentence the judge offers the brothers. There is a chance they could be given a new, lesser sentence that would make them immediately eligible for parole.\nBut eligibility does not guarantee release; they would still need to convince a state parole board they are no longer a danger to society.\nOr the judge could opt for a modified sentence that reduces their punishment but does not immediately open the door to parole. In that case, the brothers could face several more years behind bars before becoming eligible.\nThe Menendez brothers filed a motion in 2023 detailing new evidence alleging childhood sexual abuse by their father, and requesting their convictions be vacated.\nThe evidence included an allegation of rape from a former member of boy band Menudo, Roy Rossello, and a letter Erik Menendez wrote to a cousin eight months before the murders, which detailed the alleged abuse.\nThe top LA prosecutor at the time, George Gascon, announced that he was supporting the resentencing bid, days before an election in November 2024. He denied the announcement was political and argued it was a long time coming.\nGascon's announcement came shortly after a popular Netflix documentary and TV drama welcomed a new generation to the case. Many of the brothers' supporters suggest that if they were put on trial today, their allegations of abuse would be taken more seriously - potentially leading to a very different outcome.\nAfter Gascon lost his re-election bid, Nathan Hochman took over the his office and the Menendez case. Hochman came out forcefully against their resentencing request, and said the brothers continued to stick by a litany of \"lies\". \n\"They have not shown full insight into their crimes,\" he said. But Hochman was rebuked by a judge who allowed the resentencing request to move forward. \nThe brothers have been following three paths in an effort to win their freedom. The other two are: \nEarlier this year, King Charles III invited Donald Trump for an unprecedented second state visit.\nThe alleged gunman is a 20-year-old student whose mother, a sheriff's deputy, owns the gun used, police say.\nIt is the second major case Google has lost in a year, after it was found to have a monopoly on online search.\nThe pause is a major blow to the US's wind energy industry which has been targeted by President Trump.\nBBC Verify looks at the evidence behind allegations that the Salvadoran mistakenly deported to a mega-prison was a dangerous gang member.\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

They contained 12 assault rifles, 14 pistols and 999 ammunition cartridges.\nA police photo clearly shows weapons from two different US-based manufacturers.\nThe shipment had travelled nearly 1,200km (746 miles) from Fort Lauderdale in Florida to Cap-Haitien in northern Haiti, on the Rainer D cargo ship.\nThe shipping container was filled in a warehouse yard in Fort Lauderdale, according to a UN Panel of Experts, which is tasked with monitoring sanctions on Haiti and investigated the shipment.\nHaitians in the US frequently ship much-needed food and other items to the country.\nA man named Anestin Predestin told the Miami Herald that in late February 2024, he was leasing out space in the container.\nHe told the newspaper that a man who gave his name as \"Diamortino\" put in two boxes saying they contained \"clothes\" - and that he was shocked to learn later they had contained weapons.\nThe BBC's attempts to contact Mr Predestin were unsuccessful.\nIt is not clear where the guns had been bought. Guns are not manufactured in Haiti, and previous seizures have included guns bought in Florida.\nSometimes dubbed the \"gunshine state\", Florida was one of about 30 states where, until 2024, private, unlicensed sellers could sell firearms, for example at gun shows and online, without doing background checks. As president, Joe Biden tightened these rules nationally.\nThe UN panel says two Haitian brothers based in the US had used \"straw buyers\" - individuals buying on their behalf - to buy the weapons in the seized shipment.\nExperts say this is a common method, often with the guns transported in multiple shipments of small quantities, a process named \"ant trafficking\".\nThe container was shipped by the Florida-based shipping company Alliance International Shipping, Haitian police say.\nAlliance International Shipping does not own vessels travelling to Haiti, but buys space on ships and sells it on to clients such as Mr Predestin.\nThe company's president, Gregory Moraille, said in a statement to the BBC that it provides empty containers to customers, but does not physically interact with the cargo.\n\"Unfortunately, we have no viable means of preventing illicit shipments,\" he says, adding the firm co-operates with authorities and has many staff originating from Haiti.\n\"Tragically, many of our own families have been victims of gun violence in Haiti,\" he adds.\nThe BBC contacted US Customs and Border Protection to ask whether the shipment could have been checked as it left the US, but received no response.\nThe UN panel said last September that US searches had increased, but \"the vast majority of the 200 containers heading from South Florida to Haiti every week are not inspected\".\nA former official with the US Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF), Bill Kullman, told the BBC that checks on outgoing cargo are \"very scattershot\" and the volume of shipments is \"incredible\".\nHaitian police say they discovered the weapons in a \"targeted search\" of the container.\nAccording to the UN panel, a senior Haitian customs official had put one of the boxes containing weapons in his vehicle and was arrested and sacked a few days later.\nPolice said they were seeking a man called Wilmane Jean, who is named in the customs data as the consignee for the shipment - the person responsible for receiving it.\nThe BBC understands from sources in Haiti that he is a customs broker, is on the run and is suspected of being connected with gang activity in the north of the country.\nA previous UN report says Haitian customs operations suffer from a lack of capacity, corruption among senior officials, and threats and attacks from gangs.\nBBC attempts to contact Haitian customs authorities for comment were unsuccessful.\nAround the time the weapons were packed into the shipping container, a wave of gang violence swept through the Haitian capital, Port-au-Prince.\nGangs freed thousands of inmates from the main prison, and blockaded the capital's ports and airport.\nIn March 2024, Prime Minister Ariel Henry, unable to return from an overseas trip, agreed to step down.\nA record 5,601 people were killed in gang violence in Haiti in 2024, according to the UN. Its agencies say nearly a tenth of the population - over a million people - have fled their homes and half the population faces acute hunger. Kidnapping and extortion are rife.\nWilson, a handyman from Port-au-Prince, was shot in the leg while trying to flee as gangs fought over territory in his neighbourhood.\n\"It was chaos, everyone was running from their homes,\" he told the BBC. \"My leg stopped working. When I looked down, blood was pouring.\"\nHe is now living alongside hundreds of other people in a school that is being used as a shelter.\nExperts say the authorities do not have the capacity to take back control, despite support from an international security force including at least 800 Kenyan police officers.\nThe gangs have gained territory in the past six months, and now control at least 85% of the capital, says Romain le Cour, a Haiti expert at the Global Initiative against Transnational Organized Crime, an NGO with headquarters in Geneva.\nGang members frequently pose on social media with high-calibre weapons. Experts told the BBC some of the guns displayed were definitely made in the US, and others are likely to have been manufactured there too.\nHowever, guns and ammunition \"keep on coming\", says Mr Le Cour, which is \"a massive driver for violence and instability\".\nTo investigate the potential scale of trafficking from the US using similar shipping routes, the BBC analysed customs data shared with us by the shipping data platform CargoFax.\nWe compiled a list of individuals currently under sanctions for alleged gang connections in Haiti, and others who have been arrested in Haiti or the US as suspected arms traffickers.\nWe checked these names against thousands of records of shipments from the US to Haiti over four years.\nIn total, 26 people on the list were named as consignees for 286 shipments, which took place before the individuals were put under sanctions or arrested. It is not clear whether these shipments contained weapons.\nListed 24 times as a consignee was Prophane Victor - a former member of Haiti's parliament who was later put under UN and US sanctions for arming gangs and trafficking weapons. He was arrested in Haiti in January.\n\"First and foremost, US authorities are not doing enough,\" says Mr Le Cour.\nMr Kullman, the former US official at the ATF, says there is no legal obligation on gun dealers to report suspicious buyers.\nChanges to US gun laws are \"really politically difficult to achieve\", he says, but he would like to see a voluntary code of conduct for firearms sellers covering issues such as sales to suspicious buyers and information sharing.\nAlso, gun registration - similar to car registration - is in place in a few states and could be \"really helpful\" if adopted more widely, Mr Kullman adds.\nJonathan Lowy, president of Global Action on Gun Violence, says gun makers are told when trafficked guns are under investigation and are aware which dealers are selling guns to traffickers.\n\"Manufacturers cutting off these dealers would put an immediate stop to most trafficking routes from the US.\"\nThe BBC contacted the ATF and the US Department for Homeland Security for comment, but received no responses.\nMr Le Cour says international scrutiny of the problem has increased, but there is no visible impact: \"We know we have the diagnosis, we know what the symptoms are, but we're not doing anything to actually cure it\".\nAdditional reporting by Thomas Spencer, BBC Verify\nGraphics by Daniel Arce-Lopez, Jake Friend, Kate Gaynor, Gerry Fletcher and Caroline Souza\nEarlier this year, King Charles III invited Donald Trump for an unprecedented second state visit.\nThe alleged gunman is a 20-year-old student whose mother, a sheriff's deputy, owns the gun used, police say.\nIt is the second major case Google has lost in a year, after it was found to have a monopoly on online search.\nThe pause is a major blow to the US's wind energy industry which has been targeted by President Trump.\nThe pair hope to take a step towards release - decades after killing their parents in a high-profile US case.\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

      "ml_hf_summary": "In April 2024, Haitian police seized two cardboard boxes containing 12 assault rifles, 14 pistols, and 999 rounds of ammunition shipped from the US. The shipment was traced back to individuals on sanctions lists for alleged gang connections.  The seizure highlights a significant problem: guns are flowing into Haiti despite international efforts to curb trafficking. Experts point to lax US gun laws and lack of enforcement as contributing factors. Gang violence has escalated in Haiti, with over 5,600 deaths recorded in 2024, leading to displacement and humanitarian crises.  The situation underscores the need for stronger international cooperation and stricter regulations on firearms sales to combat this ongoing crisis. \n"

Observers say the mission has been underfunded and ill-equipped.\nRecently, so-called \"self-defence\" groups have formed in response to the armed gangs, leading to more deadly violence.\nProtests have also broken out in Port-au-Prince against the country's transitional presidential council, which has been unable to restore security. On April 7, the authorities declared a new, one-month state of emergency amid the violence.\n\"Declaring emergencies without equipping police with necessary resources, like effective armored vehicles, will not solve the insecurity crisis,\" the National Human Rights Defense Network, a leading Haitian rights group, said in a recent report.\n\"The absence of state response has turned the police into firefighters--constantly reacting without strategic direction--while towns fall one after another,\" the group said.\nAccording to UN figures, at least 1,518 people were killed and another 572 were injured between January 1 and March 27 in gang attacks, security force operations, and acts of violence committed by the \"self-defence\" groups and others.\nSpeaking to HRW, an aid worker in Haiti said people \"no longer have a safe place\" to go.\n\"Women ... seeking help have not only lost loved ones, but have also been raped, displaced and left on the streets, starving and struggling to survive. We don't know how much longer they can endure such suffering,\" the aid worker said.\n\"All [victims] ask is for the violence to stop. With no support from the police or government, they feel abandoned. They ask, 'Why is no one helping us? Why do Haitian lives not matter if we are human too?'\"\nThe UN also says more than 1 million Haitians have been displaced by the violence, while half of the country - some 5.5 million people - face acute food insecurity.\nIn early April, Save the Children reported that more than 40,000 children were among those displaced in the first three months of 2025.\n\"Children in Haiti are trapped in a nightmare,\" the group's Haiti country director, Chantal Sylvie Imbeault, said in a statement.\n\"They are living in deadly areas controlled by armed groups, being robbed of a normal childhood, and at constant risk of recruitment--while humanitarian aid struggles to reach them,\" she said.\n\"As displacement continues to soar, shelters are becoming completely overcrowded, leaving children vulnerable to disease, exploitation, and sexual violence.\" \n Follow Al Jazeera English:",

      "content": "Experts debunk claims of Trump declaring martial law on April 20, citing legal boundaries and confusion with the Insurrection Act.\nSocial media posts have warned for more than a month that President Donald Trump would declare martial law on April 20, which typically means suspending civil law while the military takes control of civilian functions such as courts.\nBut many of the posts appeared to conflate martial law with the potential invocation of the Insurrection Act of 1807, which was mentioned in a recent executive order.\n\"I just learned about this executive order (section 6-b) which says Trump will invoke the Insurrection Act of 1807 on April 20th which will (amount) to declaring martial law,\" a Reddit user posted on March 19. \"That's the end of the USA.\"\nThe narrative spread beyond Reddit to Facebook posts and videos shared on TikTok, X and Threads.\nTrump's January 20 executive order declared a national emergency at the US southern border and required the defence and homeland security secretaries to submit a report on border conditions within 90 days. The report should include \"any recommendations regarding additional actions that may be necessary to obtain complete operational control of the southern border, including whether to invoke the Insurrection Act of 1807\", the executive order said.\nApril 20 is the 90-day deadline.\nInvoking the Insurrection Act would allow Trump to direct federal military personnel to enforce federal law at the US southern border. But legal experts told PolitiFact it would not amount to martial law. They said they do not see a clear path for Trump to lawfully implement martial law in the way it's commonly understood. Trump, on his part, has not publicly discussed martial law.\nIn a statement to PolitiFact, the Defense Department said the agency is working with the Homeland Security Department to develop the requested report on the southern border conditions.\nPolitiFact contacted the Homeland Security Department and the White House and received no response.\nInvoking the Insurrection Act temporarily suspends another US law that forbids federal troops from conducting civilian law enforcement.\nA president can invoke the law after determining that \"unlawful obstructions, combinations, or assemblages, or rebellion\" against the federal government make it \"impracticable to enforce\" US law \"by the ordinary course of judicial proceedings\". In those cases, the Insurrection Act would allow the president to direct federal troops \"as he considers necessary to enforce those laws or to suppress the rebellion\".\nThe Insurrection Act is broadly written and does not define terms such as \"insurrection\" or \"rebellion\". In 1827, the US Supreme Court ruled that the authority to decide whether a situation represents an acceptable reason to invoke the Insurrection Act \"belongs exclusively to the President\".\nChris Edelson, an American University assistant professor of government, said the law provides a \"limited authority for the president to use the military to respond to genuine emergencies - a breakdown in regular operational law when things are really falling apart\".\nThe act was invoked when southern governors refused to integrate schools and during the 1992 Los Angeles riots, after four white police officers were acquitted in the roadside beating of a Black man, Rodney King. \n Experts expressed doubt that the situation at the US southern border constitutes a breakdown or obstruction of federal law that would necessitate the use of the Insurrection Act the way the law was intended.\nTung Yin, a Lewis and Clark Law School professor, said it's hard to see how immigrants coming into the country illegally were obstructing state or federal laws.\nObstruction is \"more like an invading army or maybe such severe riots that the government has lost control\", he said.\nMartial law, on the other hand, typically refers to imposing military law on civilians.\nEdelson said the Insurrection Act \"does not allow the president to completely replace regular authorities with military authority\".\nChris Mirasola, University of Houston Law Center assistant professor, said military law is more stringent and has fewer protections for people than civilian law. US constitutional protections would not disappear if the Insurrection Act were invoked, Mirasola said.\nYin said that when a president uses the Insurrection Act to call on the military to enforce civilian law, \"that might seem like 'martial law' to a layperson. But it's not a military government, which might be what people generally think of.\"\nIn a 1946 ruling, the US Supreme Court wrote that the term martial law \"carries no precise meaning\" and said it wasn't defined in the Constitution or an act of Congress.\nEdelson said because of this, \"At the federal level, it's not clear that presidents can declare martial law at all.\"\nMirasola said some other countries' constitutions include provisions that outline when a president can declare martial law, but the US Constitution lacks such detail.\nStill, martial law has been declared before. The US imposed martial law in Hawaii for three years after the 1941 Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. President Abraham Lincoln also declared martial law in certain parts of the US during the Civil War. President Andrew Johnson restored civilian law.\nAt that time, the Supreme Court \"more or less found that martial law could only be declared in an active war zone\", Mirasola said, citing an 1866 Supreme Court ruling that held that martial law cannot be imposed unless civilian courts aren't open and functioning.\nFor that reason, Mirasola said he could see no legal or constitutional basis for Trump to declare martial law to control the southern border, which \"is not an area of active hostilities, notwithstanding how the administration continues to talk about the actions of cartels\".\n\"The circumstances within which presidents have invoked martial law and that the Supreme Court has understood martial law are incredibly narrow,\" he said. \"It would require an active hostility on US territory that prevents civilian legal proceedings from occurring.\"\nExperts said Trump's suggestions about using military powers could be one reason for the martial law speculation: In October, Trump said \"radical left lunatics\" in the US \"should be very easily handled by, if necessary, by National Guard, or if really necessary, by the military\".\nIn June 2020, during nationwide protests following the death of George Floyd, Trump said if governors didn't deploy the National Guard to sufficiently \"dominate the streets\", he would order the US military to \"quickly solve the problem for them\".\nThen there is his willingness to challenge constitutional precedent.\nHe is trying to end birthright citizenship by executive order; the move was blocked by multiple federal judges, including one who described the order as \"blatantly unconstitutional\".\nIn mid-March, Trump said the US is being invaded by a Venezuelan gang and invoked the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, an obscure law that was used to detain or deport foreign nationals from enemy nations without due process during wartime. The Supreme Court lifted a lower court's order that temporarily halted deportations of Venezuelan migrants under the law. It did not rule whether Trump's use of the law was constitutional.\nEdelson mentioned the January 6, 2021 attack on the US Capitol, and the fact that Trump pardoned about 1,500 people charged with crimes that day.\n Caryn Baird contributed to this report. \n Follow Al Jazeera English:",
      "ml_hf_summary": "President Donald Trump's potential declaration of martial law on April 20th has been disputed by legal experts.  Social media posts have spread the claim, conflating it with the Insurrection Act of 1807, which allows for federal military intervention in situations where \"unlawful obstructions\" or \"rebellion\" against the government make enforcing US law impossible. However, legal experts argue that invoking the Insurrection Act would not constitute martial law as commonly understood and lacks a clear legal basis for Trump to implement it.  The Insurrection Act is broadly written and does not define terms like \"insurrection\" or \"rebellion,\" leaving its application open to presidential discretion. While some historical examples of the act's use exist, experts emphasize that invoking it requires active hostilities on US territory preventing civilian legal proceedings. The lack of a clear definition for martial law in the US Constitution further complicates the issue. \n"

      "content": "Civil activists negotiate with warring sides to work but face harassment, arrests, and accusations of bias.\nWhen Sudan's paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) took over most of the country's capital Khartoum in the early days of the war, the youth-led civil society initiative Hadhreen kept its food kitchens - a vital lifeline for those in need - open.\nIt was risky. Countless examples of RSF violence against civilians and looting have been recorded since Sudan's war started in April 2023.\nHadhreen didn't escape that violence. A spokesperson described to Al Jazeera an episode in August 2024 when the RSF looted supplies from a kitchen and arrested the supervisor.\nThe supervisor's fate was unknown until after the RSF was driven out of Khartoum by the Sudanese army on March 27.\n\"We discovered that the detained supervisor - whose only 'offence' was providing meals to helpless citizens through the kitchen - was martyred in the detention centres of the Rapid Support Forces,\" Hadhreen told Al Jazeera.\nThe army's recapture of Khartoum last month appeared for some to be a turning point in the devastating two-year war that has torn Sudan apart since it erupted on April 15, 2023.\nBut it is not just the RSF that has attacked civil society activists on the ground.\nEarlier this year, a number of workers in Emergency Response Rooms (ERR), grassroots networks that have led the humanitarian response since the war erupted, told Al Jazeera some of their colleagues had been killed by the army or army-aligned groups in Khartoum North. \n At the time, Al Jazeera sought comment from army spokesperson Nabil Abdullah but received no response.\nSo, civil society actors inside and outside Sudan are watching sceptically, unsure of their role in a post-war Sudan, or if they will be sidelined as they have been for two years.\nWith social and political polarisation making neutrality impossible and conditions on the ground worsening for activists, many of them told Al Jazeera civil society is being strangled in Sudan.\nThe recent history of Sudanese youth-led resistance committees started in 2010 when they actively worked on political awareness, voter registration and nation-building.\nThey took centre stage during the 2018/2019 revolution that overthrew Omar al-Bashir and truly came to the fore in October 2021 when two generals, the army's Abdel Fattah al-Burhan and the RSF's Mohamed Hamdan 'Hemedti' Dagalo, orchestrated a coup against the civilian transitional government.\nThe resistance committees organised protests, highlighted abuses by the state security apparatus and coordinated resistance and advocacy efforts with both local governments and international actors.\nWhen war erupted between the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and RSF in Khartoum on April 15, 2023, these committees became the ERRs, taking on the core response to civilians' needs, filling the vacuum left by the state.\nIt was \"a deliberate decision to focus on addressing the basic survival and humanitarian needs of people\" that led to forming these ERRs, Nada Wanni, an independent Sudanese researcher and consultant, told Al Jazeera. \n As of October 2024, a United Nations Dispatch communication said there were at least 700 ERRs in Sudan, providing food, health services, childcare, or whatever their communities needed.\nBut while the number of ERRs was rising, \"the operational space for civil society has significantly shrunk,\" the Hadhreen spokesperson told Al Jazeera, adding that: \"The SAF and the RSF have imposed significant obstacles on our operations.\"\nOn the ground, the danger to activists trying to support people is real and immediate.\n\"Since they assumed their new role, these actors and groups consciously chose not to engage in certain political discourse or certain political actions,\" Wanni says.\n\"Should they do that, they'll immediately be labelled as affiliated to one side of the war or the other. They'll likely be targeted, harassed or arrested and unable to do their humanitarian work.\"\nActivists have to \"negotiate\" with one or both sides so they can carry out their humanitarian work - \"negotiation\" that is usually deemed as collaboration by one side or the other.\nThe Hadhreen spokesperson says the organisation's volunteers have been \"interrogated, detained, and faced severe threats ... kidnappings, looting and killings\".\nIn October 2023, a civilian political bloc came into being - Taqaddum, headed by former Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok and comprising political parties and civic society, as well as armed factions. \n At first, it was seen as \"neutral\" and the best alternative to the two warring armies, but that unravelled as Taqaddum found itself accused of being pro-RSF and that the political parties within it were not inclusive of all of civil society.\nThen, in February of this year, a political tremor shook Sudan as the RSF said that it was going to form a parallel government, claiming there would be civilian-led governance in areas it controls in Sudan.\nIt took part of Taqaddum with it, the breakaway group naming itself Taasis (Foundation). Its members having taken positions in the parallel government, which was officially declared on Tuesday.\nThe rest of Taqaddum has formed Somoud (Resilience), its members rejecting the establishment of a parallel government.\nAnalysts have told Al Jazeera that this split could work to the benefit of Sumoud since it could distance itself from the RSF and better connect with Sudanese civilians.\nAs the political class outside Sudan seems to have taken sides, civil society activists on the ground who wish to remain neutral face a heavy personal cost.\nWhile civilian and political activist Mohamed Elhadi believes that a fundamental step towards a better future is a genuine civilian response that rejects both warring factions, he worries that that is not possible in the current atmosphere. \n \"Both sides have weaponised war rhetoric... The government labelled antiwar voices as [RSF] supporters, while RSF supporters argue that advocating for peace aligns with maintaining Sudan's inherited colonial-era state and its historical privileges.\n\"The ... polarisation ... [has] made it easy to discredit any independent civil efforts advocating for peace, with calls to end the conflict often dismissed as being aligned with foreign interests,\" Elhadi adds.\n\"In Sudan, you cannot say anything, neither about the government nor about the [RSF]; you can never speak your mind,\" says 28-year-old Abdurahman, who volunteers to teach English to displaced Sudanese people in Cairo.\n\"If you talk about what you are seeing over there, you will be arrested, or maybe they kill you and nobody will know about it,\" Abdurahman sighs as he remembers neighbours, friends, and even his brother-in-law, taken by the RSF.\nThis war, says Elhadi, is seen by civil society actors \"as a deliberate attempt by anti-civilian forces to obstruct Sudan's democratic transition\", one that, even as the capital is liberated, looks further and further away.\nDespite their vital role in organising on the ground, Sudanese civil society groups have found themselves sidelined in negotiations on Sudan's future, hemmed into a more \"humanitarian\" role rather than being at the table when peace and post-war political processes are discussed. \n Besides, whenever conversations do take place, logistical hindrances and military restrictions to free movement result in those present predominantly being people who fled the country and who may not be able to accurately communicate the pressing needs of those still in Sudan, which are constantly evolving.\nHowever, analysts argue that any negotiations on Sudan must include civil society because it has the capacity for grassroots organising that a political class, which has been largely outside Sudan for two years, will not have.\nBut civil society is not a homogeneous entity that can step up to a negotiating table, and as such it too bears some responsibility for making sure it is heard, development and civil society consultant Abdel-Rahman El Mahdi argues.\nHe believes that civil society lost public trust over the past 20 years as fragmentation and a lack of resources lessened the \"potential for civil society to play a meaningful role in ... future transitional processes\".\nPart of the problem may lie, however, with international actors who have been approaching the Sudan file in search of \"quick results\" and easy interlocutors, El Mahdi continues.\nAs such, he argues, \"international actors need to shift their focus from short-term interventions to a long-term strategy for supporting civil society in Sudan.\"\nBut \"the only way civil society forces can have a say in any future negotiations,\" Wanni argues, \"is if they make sure it happens. No one is going to invite them.\" \n Follow Al Jazeera English:",
      "ml_hf_summary": "In Sudan's ongoing conflict, civil society organizations (CSOs) are facing significant challenges.  Since the war began in April 2023, CSOs have been providing humanitarian aid and support to civilians, but they face harassment, arrests, and accusations of bias from both the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF).  The RSF has looted supplies from CSO kitchens and arrested supervisors, while the SAF has also targeted CSOs. \n\nCSOs have been divided into groups like Taqaddum and Taasis, with some supporting the parallel government formed by the RSF.  Despite their efforts to remain neutral, they are facing increasing pressure to take sides.  The political landscape is further complicated by international actors who often prioritize quick solutions over long-term strategies for supporting CSOs. \n\nCSOs argue that they have been sidelined in peace negotiations and lack the resources and public trust needed to effectively participate in future discussions. They believe their voices must be heard, but only if they actively engage in the process.  The future of Sudan's transition will depend on the active participation of civil society organizations. \n"

The sanctions are part of a broader U.S. strategy to counter Iran-backed Houthi activities and restore freedom of navigation in the Red Sea. \n"

This is the president's way of seeking retaliation against the attorney general for something that, in reality, is, while it's considered mortgage fraud, it's not criminal,\" he continued. \"And it's not something that would have been brought upon had the attorney general not pursued a similar case with low merit against the president a few years back.\" \nTRUMP ADMINISTRATION REFERS NY AG LETITIA JAMES FOR POSSIBLE PROSECUTION OVER ALLEGATIONS OF MORTGAGE FRAUD\nNew York Attorney General Letitia James speaks during a news conference Sept. 21, 2022, in New York. (Brittainy Newman, File/The Associated Press )\nThe Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA), an independent federal agency that oversees Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and the Federal Home Loan Bank System, sent a criminal referral to the Department of Justice Monday arguing the attorney general appeared to have falsified mortgage records to obtain more favorable loans. \nAt the heart of the case is a Norfolk, Virginia, home James purchased in 2023, which she identified on mortgage documents and a Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac form as a property that would serve as her primary residence, according to the FHFA letter dated Monday. James is legally required to live in New York as a statewide elected official in the Empire State, the letter adds. \nIdentifying a home as a primary residence versus a secondary home or vacation home comes with financial incentives, Debbas explained, because banks will offer lower interest rates to primary residences, with homeowners less likely to default on such loans compared to a second home. \n\"As a real estate attorney, we represent every major lending institution in the country,\" he said. \"And a common underwriting requirement for banks is to solidify what the use of the property is going to be, meaning, is it a primary residence, second home or investment property.\"And the reason banks do that is that clearly there's a higher rate of default when it comes to investment properties and second homes as opposed to primary residences.\"\nThe Trump administration's criminal referral targeting New York Attorney General Letitia James for reported mortgage fraud likely never would have unfolded if not for the Democrat's years of targeting the president in court, a New York City real estate attorney and expert told Fox News Digital. (Seth Wenig, Pool/The Associated Press)\n\"The reason being is people, you know, don't want to leave their homes,\" he said. \"Now, a second home investment property, you may be a little more inclined to throw the keys to the bank.\" \nCOURT NAMES NEW JUDGE IN TRUMP CIVIL FRAUD CASE BEFORE REASSIGNING PREVIOUS JUDGE HOURS LATER\nThe bank then requires the borrower to sign an affidavit confirming that the home being acquired will be used as a primary residence, he explained. \n\"Now, if that is not the intent or that is in fact inaccurate, and you sign that agreement, you are in fact committing mortgage fraud,\" he said. \"And the bank relies on that agreement in giving you the loan. Now, would they have given you a loan if it were a second home? Potentially, but the difference is the interest rate would be significantly higher.\" \nThe bank's recourse when discovering such mortgage fraud related to misidentifying a property as a primary residence to obtain more favorable loan terms is \"simply to call the loan,\" he said. \nState Attorney General Letitia James is a longtime political foe of President Donald Trump who campaigned for the attorney general job in 2018 by vowing to aggressively pursue legal charges against Trump if elected. (Lev Radin/Pacific Press/LightRocket via Getty Images)\n\"They would call the loan, force you to pay it off by a certain date,\" he said. \"If you're unable to sell the property or take other liquidity that you have to pay off the loan, they have the right to pursue a foreclosure action. They'd be legally granted this right. It would be very difficult to contest under those circumstances because, technically speaking, this is a default and this is fraud.\" \nThe New York City real estate attorney added that this type of fraud is common. \nLONGTIME TRUMP FOE LETITIA JAMES REVIEWING POSSIBLE INSIDER TRADING OVER PRESIDENT'S TARIFF PAUSE\n\"What extent is it fraud? To be quite honest with you, this is a very common thing that does take place in the real estate market,\" he said. \"I'm not saying it's right. I'm not saying Letitia James ... the full extent of the law shouldn't be applied to her. But it is something that takes place. Because if the loan is current, the bank hasn't really suffered any detriment, but it's still mortgage fraud. So that doesn't take away the fraud component to this.\" \nDebbas argued this type of fraud does not rise to the level of criminal activity because the bank can call the loan, take back the property or force it to be liquidated.\n\"The attorney general's case that was brought against Donald Trump was honestly a pure manipulation of the legal system, and it was laughable,\" New York City attorney Pierre Debbas said, referring to the civil fraud case she brought against Trump. (Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images)\nJames' office told The New York Times that a separate loan application for the 2023 Norfolk, Virginia, home purchase reportedly indicated she would not live at the property full time, and that her mortgage agreement did not require her to occupy the property as her primary residence. \nJames is a longtime political foe of Trump's who campaigned for the attorney general job in 2018 by vowing to aggressively pursue legal charges against Trump if elected, adding she'd expose the \"con man\" after her win that year. \nHer office leveled nearly 100 legal challenges against the first Trump administration and added after his second presidential win in 2024 that she would continue challenging him in the courts to \"defend the rights of New Yorkers and the rule of law.\"\nNY AG LETITIA JAMES SKEWERED FOR 'DISTASTEFUL' REMARKS AFTER TRUMP VICTORY: 'UTTER ARROGANCE'\nMost notably, James pursued a civil fraud case against Trump and the Trump Organization for inflating the values of properties to obtain more favorable loans, insurance coverage and tax deductions, which resulted in a $454 million judgment in 2024. \nA spokesperson for James' office told Fox Digital Thursday that \"multiple times during the attorney general's trial against President Trump and the Trump Organization for years of financial fraud, President Trump's attorneys repeatedly made the argument that the attorney general's lawsuit was politically motivated.\n\"Every single time, the judge rejected that argument and even sanctioned the attorneys for making it,\" the spokesperson added. \"Attorney General James won her lawsuit, and the judgment against President Trump now exceeds half a billion dollars.\" \nFox News contributor Jonathan Turley noted the irony of Trump's criminal referral over allegations of James fudging numbers to obtain more favorable loans after pursing Trump for something similar. \n\"This is a person who prosecuted Trump for everything short of ripping a label off a mattress, and among the charges that were brought in New York, in not just the civil but the criminal case, was making false or misleading statements to financial institutions,\" the legal scholar said on Fox News' \"The Ingraham Angle\" Tuesday. \"As for James, if we apply the Letitia James standard that she created, there'd be little question here. This seems pretty straightforward.\"\nThe administration is looking into the allegations put forth by the FHFA while underscoring that \"no one is above the law,\" White House spokesman Harrison Fields said on Newsmax Wednesday. \n\"With the Democratic Party, they love to throw stones in glass homes when they realize that they're committing the crimes that they're actually trying to go against,\" Fields said. \n\"So, this is now a criminal referral that the Department of Justice under Attorney General Pam Bondi will have to look at,\" he added. \"The allegations from the FHFA are very serious. We're going to look at them, and no one is above the law. And Tish James, she'd like to say that about the president, but she should look in the mirror and realize that if you have skeletons in your closets about abusing the law and doing illegal things, maybe you shouldn't be purveying around like some justice queen, because you're not.\" \nNY AG LETITIA JAMES RESPONDS TO ALLEGATIONS OF MORTGAGE FRAUD\nThe criminal referral also cited past reported issues with James' properties, including a 2001 purchase of a Brooklyn property. The certificate of occupancy lists the property as a five-unit residence, while James' mortgages list the property as four units. \nDebbas explained that five-unit properties are identified as commercial properties, which would require a commercial loan that has higher interest rates than a residential loan. However, the banks carry the burden of confirming whether a building is commercial or residential. \n\"If the borrower has the ability to tell the bank or convince the bank that it's actually four units, it's to their financial benefit,\" he said. \"Now, when you look at a certificate of occupancy, certificate of the occupancy is issued by the Department of Buildings, which tells you the legal use of the building.\nLetitia James' office leveled nearly 100 legal challenges against the first Trump administration and said after his second presidential win in 2024 she would continue challenging him in the courts to \"defend the rights of New Yorkers and the rule of law.\" (Gary Hershorn/Getty Images)\n\"This is a five-family dwelling,\" he said. \"Now, this is unequivocally a commercial property. The burden was on the bank to confirm this, but if the borrower did, in fact, have concrete knowledge ... an argument can be made that mortgage fraud did take place in the application of this law.\" \nJames' office told The New York Times a rider attached to the Brooklyn mortgage stated the building was four units, not five. \nDebbas added that before the 2008 market crash, there was a lot of \"shadiness\" in the world of mortgages. \n\"As an elected official ... there should be a heightened standard for honesty and obliging by your legal requirements not falsifying documents or committing fraud,\" Debbas said. \nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nWhile reflecting specifically on the Virginia home alleged mortgage fraud, he added, \"Now, how would this impact her seating as attorney general of the state of New York? At the end of the day, that's going to be determined largely based on how many enemies she's created. But from a purely mortgage standpoint, it is certainly mortgage fraud, but, in my opinion, it does not warrant any criminal activity.\"\nA spokesperson for James' office said Wednesday morning she has been \"focused every single day on protecting New Yorkers, especially as this administration weaponizes the federal government against the rule of law and the Constitution. She will not be intimidated by bullies -- no matter who they are,\" Fox Digital previously reported. \n This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed.

(David Dee Delgado for Fox News Digital)\nLast week, Mangione's lawyers argued that seeking death in the federal case, which was filed after New York prosecutors leveled their own murder and terrorism charges against him, is \"arbitrary and capricious\" and that the directive for U.S. attorneys to seek capital punishment is politically motivated and influenced by Thompson's status as a prominent CEO.\n\"Bigger picture, this may reflect a shift in DOJ policy where they will seek the death penalty in blue states that have a moratorium on or have an outright ban on capital punishment.\"\nFederal prosecutors replied with a filing of their own, arguing it was too early to make the argument and that the defense has no authority over how the government shows evidence to a grand jury.\nLUIGI MANGIONE PROSECUTORS DIRECTED TO SEEK DEATH PENALTY IN FEDERAL CEO MURDER CASE\nOn Wednesday, Mangione's attorneys, Karen Friedman Agnifilo and Avi Moskowitz, shot back, accusing the government of violating their client's right to due process by allegedly violating rules about commenting on a pending case outside the courtroom.\nLuigi Mangione is escorted from an NYPD helicopter in New York City Dec. 19, 2024. (Rashid Umar Abbasi for Fox News Digital)\nCentral to the issue is the death penalty announcement, which appeared on the Justice Department's Instagram in a quote attributed to Bondi, which they said was prejudicial to the jury pool.\nMangione's defense said waiting for an indictment would mean waiting too long.\n\"Once a prejudiced grand jury returns a death-eligible indictment, it is simply too late,\" they argued. \nBut the defense faces an uphill battle with those arguments of selective prosecution, according to Neama Rahmani, a Los Angeles-based former federal prosecutor who has been following the case.\nUnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, left, was shot and killed in midtown Manhattan on his way to a shareholder conference. Surveillance cameras captured the ambush. (Businesswire; NYPD Crimestoppers)\n\"It didn't work for Donald Trump. It didn't work for Hunter Biden and it won't work for Mangione,\" he told Fox News Digital. \"It's a very difficult and high legal burden to meet.\"\nHe predicted that the Justice Department under Bondi, a Trump nominee, may begin to more aggressively seek ways to impose the death penalty for crimes committed in blue states that don't have capital punishment on the books. \n\"Bigger picture, this may reflect a shift in DOJ policy where they will seek the death penalty in blue states that have a moratorium on or have an outright ban on capital punishment,\" he said.\nTrump has previously said he wants to expand the federal death penalty to cover more crimes and end a moratorium on federal executions put in place by former President Joe Biden.\nLuigi Mangione appears in Manhattan Supreme Court in New York City Dec. 23, 2024. (Curtis Means for DailyMail/Pool)\nThompson, 50, was a father of two visiting New York City for a publicly announced shareholder conference.

He awaits another court hearing at the end of the month. \nCouch, meanwhile, has been hospitalized on life support for the past two weeks since the April 5 attack, and officials have said he is not expected to survive his injuries. \nHe and his wife, Kristen Couch, were in California mourning the loss of their stillborn son a year ago.

He was just a caring person. He loved his family. He was really big about his family.\" \nAuthorities have released few details about the potential motive for the crime. Michael's lawyer in the initial bond hearing claimed \"self-defense\" couldn't be ruled out in asking the judge for a lesser bond. \nThe victim's brother, however, told Fox News Digital that detectives said they determined \"there is no evidence to support any claims of self-defense.\"\n\"And they said that he was going to be trying to grasp straws, grasp anything. I mean, my brother was attacked from behind while he was bent over. That is not self-defense,\" Luke Couch said. \n\"I want to make sure this man never does this again and no other family has to go through what my family has went through.

He also had a message for prosecutors handling the case. \n\"Please do not let this slip through the cracks. We will not let this slip through the cracks as a family. Do not let this man get out and do this again,\" he said. \"If anybody is on the fence about whether it's ethical or whatnot for 'an eye for an eye' or a harsher punishment, I encourage them to go and look at my brother lying up in a hospital bed.\" \n\"This country is not as safe as we thought,\" Luke Couch continued. \"Please don't let these criminals think that they can just get away with this because, from my understanding, this has become a pattern in Tucson.

Trump signed the order on his first day in office and was immediately met with a flurry of lawsuits across the country.\nThe administration's appeal concerns three nationwide injunctions brought in Maryland, Massachusetts and Washington state.\nTRUMP ADMIN APPEALS RULING BLOCKING BIRTHRIGHT CITIZENSHIP\nSupreme Court Justices Samuel Alito, Clarence Thomas, Brett M.

(Ricky Carioti/The Washington Post via Getty Images)\nAll three states had issued nationwide injunctions blocking the birthright citizenship ban from taking force -- a move that lawyers for the Trump administration argued in their Supreme Court filing was overly broad.\nActing U.S. Solicitor General Sarah Harris asked the justices to limit the scope of the rulings to cover only individuals directly impacted by the relevant courts. \n\"These cases -- which involve challenges to the President's January 20, 2025 Executive Order concerning birthright citizenship -- raise important constitutional questions with major ramifications for securing the border,\" Harris wrote in their appeal. \nTo date, no court has sided with the Trump administration's executive order seeking to ban birthright citizenship, though multiple district courts have blocked it from taking effect. \nNINTH CIRCUIT REJECTS TRUMP'S BID TO REINSTATE BIRTHRIGHT CITIZENSHIP ORDER\nSupreme Court justices attend the State of the Union address by President Joe Biden at the Capitol in Washington, D.C., on March 7, 2024. (Shawn Thew-Pool/Getty Images)\nImplementation of Trump's executive order was initially set for Feb. 19. The policy would have affected hundreds of thousands of children born in the U.S. each year.\nThe order sought to reinterpret the 14th Amendment, which states: \"All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.\"\nUnder the Trump administration's proposed interpretation -- later blocked by federal courts -- children born to illegal immigrants or to those who were here legally but on temporary non-immigrant visas, are not citizens by birthright.\nMore than 22 U.S. states and immigrants' rights groups quickly sued the Trump administration to block the change to birthright citizenship, arguing in court filings that the executive order is both unconstitutional and \"unprecedented.\"\nCLICK TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nThe states have also argued that the 14th Amendment does, in fact, guarantee citizenship to persons born on U.S. soil and naturalized in the U.S.\nThe U.S. is one of roughly 30 countries where birthright citizenship applies.\nBreanne Deppisch is a national politics reporter for Fox News Digital covering the Trump administration, with a focus on the Justice Department, FBI, and other national news. \nGet the latest updates from the 2024 campaign trail, exclusive interviews and more Fox News politics content.\nBy entering your email and clicking the Subscribe button, you agree to the Fox News Privacy Policy and Terms of Use, and\n agree to receive content and promotional communications from Fox News.

My friend was just killed ... If I don't get out of here, I'll watch over you from heaven,\" he said, according to his mother.\nLater, a man who said he was Robert's friend wrote to his sister via social media to tell her that he had died in a shoot-out.\n\"I thought hitmen wanted to do that work.

The cartel is led by Nemesio Ruben \"El Mencho\" Oseguera Cervantes, for whom the U.S. government has offered a $15 million reward for information leading to his capture.\nJalisco state accounts for 12% of the roughly 127,000 missing people in Mexico, mainly young men.\nMany disappearances are linked to forced recruitment because gangs need armies to control their territory and to generate illicit income, according to Jorge Ramirez, a researcher at the University of Guadalajara.\nThe victims are often poor young people without access to education, he said.\nIn 2024, around 30 young people were reported to have disappeared after attending what they believed would be job interviews in Guadalajara, the Jalisco state capital.\nDespite her fears, Rubi Cruz still hopes to find her husband alive.\nVeronica Cruz's optimism has waned, but she still wants answers.\n\"Maybe I'm not looking for justice, but I want to know where my son is -- whatever it takes,\" she said.\nMultiple mass graves have been found in recent months in Mexico. In January, at least 56 bodies were discovered in unmarked mass graves in northern Mexico, not far from the border with the United States.\nA mass grave discovered in December 2024 in a suburb of Guadalajara with dozens of bags of dismembered body parts contained the remains of 24 people, authorities said. That same month, Mexican authorities said they recovered a total of 31 bodies from pits in Chiapas, a state plagued by cartel violence.\nCollectives searching for missing persons say that drug trafficking cartels and other organized crime gangs sometimes use ovens to incinerate their victims and leave no trace. \n (c) 2025 CBS Interactive Inc.

The 24-year-old was initially arrested more than six years after another American was killed with arrows by the tribe on the same island.\nMykhailo Viktorovych Polyakov will next appear before a local court in Port Blair -- the capital of India's Andaman and Nicobar Islands -- on April 29, police said.\nPolyakov, from Scottsdale, Arizona, was arrested on March 31, two days after he set foot on the restricted territory of North Sentinel Island in a bid to meet people from the reclusive Sentinelese tribe.\n\"It may be claimed to be an adventure trip, but the fact is that there has been a violation of Indian laws. Outsiders meeting Sentinelese could endanger the tribe's survival,\" said a senior police officer, requesting anonymity as he isn't authorized to speak about the case under investigation.\nPolyakov is suspected of violating Indian laws that carry a possible sentence of up to five years in prison and a fine.\nVisitors are banned from traveling within 3 miles of North Sentinel Island, whose population has been isolated from the rest of the world for thousands of years. The inhabitants use spears and bows and arrows to hunt the animals that roam the small, heavily forested island. Deeply suspicious of outsiders, they attack anyone who lands onto their beaches.\nIn 2018, John Allen Chau, an American missionary who landed illegally on the beach was killed by North Sentinelese Islanders who apparently shot him with arrows and then buried his body on the beach. In 2006, the Sentinelese had killed two fishermen who had accidentally landed on the shore.\nAn official from the U.S. consulate visited Polyakov in jail earlier this week. The U.S embassy in Delhi didn't immediately respond to a request confirming the visit or any further updates on Polyakov.\nPolice said Polyakov had conducted detailed research on sea conditions, tides and accessibility to the island before starting his journey. He stayed on the beach for about an hour, blowing a whistle to attract the attention but got no response from the islanders.\nThe young American had twice attempted to visit the island in the past, and left a can of Diet Coke and a coconut as offering for the tribe this time after he failed to contact the Sentinelese. He shot a video of the island on his camera and collected some sand samples before returning to his boat.\nAfter his arrest, the charity Survival International issued a statement, calling Polyakov's actions \"deeply disturbing.\"\n\"It beggars belief that someone could be that reckless and idiotic,\" the group's director, Carolina Pearce, said. \"This person's actions not only endangered his own life, they put the lives of the entire Sentinelese tribe at risk. It's very well known by now that uncontacted peoples have no immunity to common outside diseases like flu or measles, which could completely wipe them out.\"\nOn his return he was spotted by local fishermen, who informed the authorities and Polyakov was arrested in Port Blair, an archipelago nearly 750 miles east of India's mainland. \n (c) 2025 CBS Interactive Inc.

      "content": "Warning: This story contains spoilers about the Apprentice winner\nLord Sugar has hired his newest business partner in the final of the 19th series of The Apprentice.\nHe had a choice between Anisa Khan, who sells Indian food-flavoured pizzas, and Dean Franklin, who runs an air conditioning company, in a battle he billed as \"chilli versus the chiller\".\nThe final signalled the end of a bruising 12-week process that started with 18 budding entrepreneurs vying to become Lord Sugar's latest protege.\nIn the end, Lord Sugar chose to give his PS250,000 investment to Dean, from Essex, despite noting there had been \"a few rocky moments\" where he had only remained in the programme \"by the skin of your teeth\".\n\"I can't believe I've just won The Apprentice,\" Dean said. \"This is going to mean the world to me and my family. My kids are going to be over the moon.\"\nHe made it through to the final despite having a difficult time in the penultimate episode, the interviews with Lord Sugar's famously tough advisers.\nHe froze and started laughing after one interviewer, Mike Soutar, challenged his nonsensical claims about climate change, including that there was \"an increase in climate control\" and \"the climate zone is depleting\".\nHe was also asked about his company's website, which says his engineers would \"always treat your home as if it were their own\". Soutar then produced a picture from Dean's social media showing a sex toy that he had stuck to a customer's air conditioning unit.\nIn the final, the show's previously fired contestants returned to help Dean and Anisa create advertising campaigns for their companies.\nDean tasked some of his team-mates with making a TV ad - which had to be hastily reshot because it showed someone being persuaded to buy air conditioning to heat up their house, not cool it down.\nDuring the episode, Lord Sugar said air conditioning made Dean an \"honest living\" but he needed to show a \"scalable proposition\".\nOwnership of Dean's company was previously split between his existing business partner and their two wives, with each having a 25% share.\nLord Sugar will now be given the wives' 50% in return for his investment.\nHe asked Dean: \"They'll give it to me and they won't get the hump over that then, will they? They won't make you sleep in the spare bedroom?\"\nDean assured him: \"They know the plan. We're still married so what's mine is hers. So it makes no difference.\"\nThe amount Lord Sugar invests has remained the same since 2011, and previous winner Tom Pellereau - the first to receive that sum - said: \"Fourteen years ago, PS250,000 went quite a lot further than it does today.\n\"My controversial point is, I do think they should double the money.\n\"I think PS500,000 or PS1m would be an incredible prize,\" Pellereau told BBC Radio 5 Live.\nThe Apprentice final is available to watch on BBC iPlayer.\nWarfare is also coming out, while new game Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is released.\nThe businessman and TV personality talks about his life, career, The Apprentice and Donald Trump.\nPhil Turner, Ricky Groves, Dean Gaffney and Calum Best are among the celebrities taking part. \nMax England, from Surrey, tells BBC Radio Surrey about Lord Sugar, NDAs and his love of padel.\n\"I think we're built different around here,\" says car boot sale trader Sonny Green.\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

      "ml_hf_summary": "Lord Sugar chose Dean Franklin, owner of an air conditioning company, as his newest business partner after a final challenge on The Apprentice.  Dean faced stiff competition from Anisa Khan, who sells Indian food-flavored pizzas, and ultimately won the £250,000 investment despite facing challenges during the interviews with Lord Sugar's advisors. Dean's company previously had ownership split between him and his business partners, but Lord Sugar will now take over their 50% share of ownership.  The Apprentice final aired on BBC iPlayer, featuring previous contestants returning to help Dean and Anisa create advertising campaigns. Tom Pellereau, the first winner to receive £250,000 in 2011, suggests doubling the investment amount for future winners. \n"

      "content": "A haunting image of a young Gazan boy recovering from war injuries has been named World Press Photo of the Year for 2025.\nThe portrait, taken by Palestinian photographer Samar Abu Elouf for the New York Times, shows nine-year-old Mahmoud Ajjour, who lost both arms in an Israeli airstrike in Gaza City in March 2024. \nAbu Elouf, who was evacuated from Gaza in late 2023, lives in the same apartment complex as Mahmoud in Doha, Qatar. \nShe has documented the lives of several wounded Gazans who made it out for treatment.\n\"This is a quiet photo that speaks loudly,\" said World Press Photo executive director Joumana El Zein Khoury. \n\"It tells the story of one boy, but also of a wider war that will have an impact for generations.\"\nTwo finalists were selected as runners up alongside the photo of the year. \nNight Crossing by John Moore for Getty Images and Droughts in the Amazon by Musuk Nolte for Panos Pictures, Bertha Foundation.\nThis striking image offers a powerful, intimate view of life at the border, capturing the complex realities of migration often lost in the polarised debate in the United States.\nA young man carries food to his mother in the Amazon village of Manacapuru - once reachable by boat, now cut off by drought. \nHe walks two kilometres along a dry riverbed, a stark reminder of the region's deepening water crisis. \nThe sight of parched, desert-like terrain in the world's largest rainforest underscores the alarming scale of the drought.\nThis year's winners represent the best of the 59,320 photographs by 3,778 photographers from 141 countries. \nHere is a selection of the regional winners, with captions from the competition.\nThe three categories were singles (solo photographs), stories (series of 4-10 photos) and long-term projects (24-30 photos on a single theme). \nTamale Safalu trains in front of his home in Kampala, Uganda. Safulu lost his right leg in a motorcycle accident but still competes, becoming the first bodybuilder with a disability in Uganda to compete against able-bodied athletes.\nIn Livingstone, Zambia, failed rainy seasons and expanding human settlements have fuelled a sharp rise in human-elephant conflict. In 2024 alone, elephants killed at least 11 people in the area. \nA local volunteer group is now working to protect both communities and wildlife.\nIn 2017, photographer Cinzia Canneri began documenting the lives of Eritrean women escaping authoritarian rule. \nSince the war in Ethiopia's Tigray region erupted, her focus has widened to include Tigrayan women fleeing violence. \nBoth groups have faced brutal attacks, including rape, torture, and shootings. Zayid, 23 (not her real name - pictured) was raped in a refugee camp in Amhara. \nWhile fleeing with her family to Addis Ababa, she and her sister were shot and wounded by Amhara soldiers.\nSince the 1950s, around 200,000 Korean children have been adopted into the United States. \nAn Associated Press investigation has revealed widespread fraud in adoption documents, leaving many adoptees with false or incomplete histories. \nFor individuals like Nicole, who is pictured, the search for identity has uncovered painful truths about their past.\nMyanmar, formerly Burma, has faced decades of unrest and conflict since gaining independence, with ongoing struggles for ethnic and regional autonomy. \nYe Aung Thu, who witnessed the 1988 military coup at the age of six, saw history repeat itself in 2021 when his own son was the same age. \nHe has since travelled across the country, documenting insurgent groups and capturing how their resilience offers hope amid turmoil.\nThe Ngai Tuhoe people of the Te Urewera region in New Zealand have maintained a staunch independence. With a 2014 agreement, the New Zealand government opened the way to Tuhoe managing their ancestral lands according to their cultural values.\nRecent changes by New Zealand's right-wing government are seen as reversals of such policies regarding indigenous peoples. Yet the Tataiwhetu Trust farm in Te Urewera offers a revitalising model for a younger generation.\nOngoing conflict in their home village near Kupiansk, a frontline city in Russia's invasion of Ukraine, forced Anhelina's family to seek refuge. \nShe now lives with her grandmother, Larisa, in Borshchivka, 95km from Kupiansk, while her mother lives and works in Kharkiv, about an hour's journey away. \nAna Maria Jeremias has spent over four decades working as a carer and domestic worker in Portugal, reflecting the experience of many women across Europe.\nTrafficked from Angola at the age of nine under the false promise of an education, she has since played a vital, often overlooked, role in the lives of the families she has served.\nKardash, a Russian-born photographer now living in Germany, reflects on the loss of home and the pain of loving those who see the world differently. \nReturning to her hometown, she seeks to capture how war reshapes lives, while holding on to the hope that human connection can endure even amid deep divisions.\nThe assassination attempt on Donald Trump is widely seen as a pivotal moment in the 2024 presidential campaign, with lasting implications for the political future of the United States. \nMoments after the shooting, the Republican nominee shouted \"Fight, fight, fight!\" as he was led from the stage. \nCaptured seconds later, this image offers a rare glimpse of vulnerability in a campaign centred on strength and resilience.\nFarshi's project examines how people confront death in a setting shaped by compassion and choice. \nIn a quiet residential neighbourhood in Washington state, where assisted dying is legal in certain circumstances, a house offers the terminally ill a place to spend their final hours, surrounded by care and community.\nHere, with support and dignity, some choose to end their lives by taking prescribed medication, highlighting the deeply personal, and often tender, process of dying.\nIn 2022, El Salvador declared a \"state of emergency\" to combat gang violence, restricting rights like assembly and privacy. \nRenewed 35 times by March 2025, it has led to mass incarceration and overcrowded prisons, where reports of abuse and neglect are common. \nThis project focuses on the personal stories behind these policies, revealing the human toll of the crackdown.\nBetween April and June 2024, record-breaking rainfall in the state of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, led to the worst flood in the area's history.\nThe Embera Dobida, a nomadic indigenous group from Colombia, have migrated to Bogota to escape paramilitary violence but face discrimination in the capital.\nSuicides in the community have risen sharply, from 15 between 2015 and 2020 to 67 suicides and over 400 attempts by 2024. \nThis project highlights the lives of Embera women affected by the crisis, shedding light on their struggles.\nThis project follows the dangerous journeys of migrants crossing the Darien Gap, a 100-kilometre stretch of dense jungle between Colombia and Panama. \nTheir paths are fraught with peril, from treacherous rivers and harsh terrain to the constant threat of violence and exploitation.\nCross-border attacks between Israel and Lebanon-based Hezbollah, which had been ongoing since the start of the Gaza conflict, intensified sharply in September 2024.\nBeirut, once a safe haven for those fleeing airstrikes in southern Lebanon, itself came under fire as the violence spread northwards.\nIn Afghanistan, the Taliban government denies access to education to girls over 12, bars them from most work outside the home and in some regions, forbids them from leaving home without a male guardian, or with their face uncovered. \nThe spaces where women once gathered freely are now off limits. Despite these restrictions, Afghan women find subtle but powerful ways to resist. \nKolbars (border couriers) carry goods, such as household appliances, mobile phones, and clothes, on their backs through treacherous terrain from Iraq and Turkey into Iranian Kurdistan. \nDecades-long marginalisation of Kurds means widespread unemployment in the region, driving many to a life of kolbari, where they risk being shot by security forces and border patrols.\nAll photographs courtesy World Press Photo Foundation\nThe World Press Photo Exhibition 2025 will take place at MPB Gallery, Here East, London from 23rd May - 25th August 2025\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

It may be some kind of recreational use, depending on the view of the planning bodies. \n\"It may be something very different.\"\nBluestone National Park Resort, which employs 700 people, is adjacent to Oakwood, but a spokesperson had declined to comment on whether it would be interested in purchasing the site. \nProf Jones said the holiday resort had previously expanded in a considered and \"careful\" way.\n\"I suspect Bluestone would look on this with a fair bit of trepidation unless the land is available cheaply,\" he added.\n\"I can't imagine we'll see anything quick happening with the land if Bluestone were to take it.\"\nMr Kurtz said \"plenty of businesses\" had been in touch with him expressing an interest in purchasing the former theme park. \nHe added: \"This is a bit of a plea to the parent company - let's work together and try and get going to find a buyer for this site.\n\"I've not yet heard from them. I really wish they get back in touch with me.\"\nThe Welsh government said it \"continues to engage\" with the owner of the site.\n\"We recognise the significant value the former Oakwood site holds for locals and visitors, and are hopeful a buyer will come forward to ensure its continued contribution to the local economy and tourism industry,\" a spokesperson said. \nPembrokeshire council confirmed it had not held any discussions with Aspro Parks.\nAspro did not respond to enquiries from BBC Wales.\nA council cuts ticket booths from 16 to 10, and says touts cannot be near a lifeboat station.\nSelf-catering operators say rules to improve access to housing for locals leave many struggling.\nFrom romantic retreats in the Mediterranean to fresh-air-filled Alpine hikes, these are the most exciting areas of Europe to visit this year.\nBCP Council leader Millie Earl cut the ribbon at Kings Park Leisure and Learning Centre.\nWedding celebrant Zena Birch was invited on the trip by a couple she helped marry a decade earlier.\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

      "content": "Jen Troth has always wanted to be a mum, but a medical professional telling her she should not have children because of her sight loss has made the prospect \"terrifying\".\nThe 29-year-old social media influencer, who lives in Cardiff, has the hereditary condition retinitis pigmentosa and only has about 10% of her sight left.\nShe said there needed to be better awareness that disabled people \"exist in public life\".\nMeanwhile, other women with sight loss have said their children had become \"confident and caring\" people as a result of their experiences.\nThe Welsh government said it provided funding \"to help people with sight loss live confidently and safely\".\nMs Troth said she experienced \"generational trauma\" due to her father and grandmother having the same condition.\nHer dad Peter, 74, \"was basically told he was unemployable\" as a mechanic when he began to lose his sight, forcing him to move to Dubai to start his own business.\n\"Because of this, I was raised not to talk about my blindness and I didn't tell anyone until I was 24,\" she said. \n\"I was afraid to tell employers, to tell friends.\"\nShe said safety considerations faced by many women were heightened by sight loss, particularly regarding relationships.\nMs Troth added: \"You just have to trust that people in your life are going to be good people when, in a lot of cases, they're probably not.\n\"I had a previous partner lock me in a room once, to try and 'scare the blindness out of me' and prove I wasn't blind.\"\nShe said these issues extended to medical professionals and she was \"consistently\" told by an eye care consultant that she \"should not have children\".\n\"I have always wanted to be a mum. I'm very family orientated,\" she said, adding she was now \"less afraid of going totally blind than being a mother\".\nShe said she worried about coping as a mother, particularly as her partner, who was an engineer, often worked away.\n\"It's honestly terrifying,\" Ms Troth said. \n\"I've not got any peripheral vision - how am I going to see a child running around? How am I going to be allowed to look after a baby by myself? How do I access support?\n\"You're also constantly thinking 'if I don't have a child soon, will I ever get to see what my child would look like?'\"\nThere are about 2.2m people living with sight loss across the UK and 60% are women.\nUntil the 1960s, these women were were often considered unfit to parent and some went through sterilisation. \nBut the Royal National Institute of Blind People (RNIB) said many disabled women continued to fight for respect and support today.\nAbout 41% of blind and partially-sighted women feel there were misconceptions about mothers with sight loss, and 26% believed these were held by health professionals, its research found.\nMs Troth uses social media to raise awareness, visiting hospitality venues and showing what they were like for someone with access needs. \nRhian Morris, from Bridgend, has nystagmus, myopia, and glaucoma and has lived with visual impairments since she was born. \nTwo of her sons, aged 13 and three, have sight loss, while her one-year-old has Down's Syndrome.\n\"Stuff like changing nappies, I probably take a bit longer with... buttons and poppers on baby grows, I've lost hope with - I buy ones with zippers now,\" Ms Morris said.\nShe said taking her son to school could be challenging \"because of people parking on pavements\", but she had a symbol on her pram telling people she had sight loss. \nThe 39-year-old said her phone was her \"lifeline\" as it allowed her to take photos of things and then zoom in, adding: \"I have taken the boys away on my own and done days out on my own because I want the boys to know they can do it. \n\"If you can't do something, you will find a way around it or you will ask for help.\"\nShe believed sometimes people, often well-intentioned, underestimate her abilities, but women with sight loss \"shouldn't be afraid\" to become mums.\n\"Anyone has to adapt to having children, it's no different,\" she added.\nTafsila Khan, a mum of three from Cardiff who also has retinitis pigmentosa, said her sight deterioration was gradual until her early 30s, after she had her children - none of whom inherited the condition.\nThe 41-year-old added that, from a young age, her children could look out for the correct bus, order at a cafe, or ask a retail worker for help.\nShe said: \"Taking them to the park and things, I thought would be a challenge, but they've grown up with a mum with sight loss so, for them, that's just the norm. \n\"It has made them so much more confident... they've had to do things other children didn't, but I feel it's had a positive effect.\"\nAnsley Workman, director of RNIB Cymru, said negative opinions towards people with sight loss and \"assumptions about their ability to parent\" could have a \"huge impact on their confidence and access to resources\".\n\"Becoming a parent can bring new and unexpected challenges, regardless of who you are. This doesn't stop parenting from being a hugely rewarding and exciting experience,\" she said.\n\"RNIB Cymru is calling for everyone to support mothers with sight loss by making information accessible and dispelling harmful myths.\"\nThe Welsh government said the Wales Low Vision Service, provided by optometry practices, was the only service of its kind in the UK and provided more than 8,000 appointments for people with sight loss, of which almost 5,500 were women, in the 2023-24 year.\n\"We fund a number of organisations to help people with sight loss live confidently and safely, and work with the Wales Vision Forum to improve access to services,\" it added.\nCardiff head coach Matt Sherratt is hoping his side do not lose players because the organisation was placed into administration and taken over by the Welsh Rugby Union.\nThe Mayor and Mayoress go shopping wearing goggles that replicate the effect of a visual impairment.\nSmokey the 22-year-old stallion is taken in by experts at an animal sanctuary.\nParia Veisi, from Cathays, was last seen at 15:00 BST on Saturday 12 April. \nWales wing Josh Adams signs a new contract to stay with Cardiff, who have been taken over by the Welsh Rugby Union.\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

      "content": "The longest waiting lists for planned NHS treatments fell by more than a quarter in February, according to the latest statistics.\nIn February there were 15,505 cases where somebody had waited more than two years compared to more than 21,087 in January - a decrease of more than 26%.\nHealth Secretary Jeremy Miles welcomed the drop and said it showed what could be achieved when health boards focus on \"delivery\" and \"new ways of working\".\nBut the figures suggest considerable progress is still needed if the NHS in Wales is to hit the First Minister's target of reducing waits of two years and over to 8,000 by March.\nThere is a two-month time-lag in publishing NHS waiting times data which means the position at the end of March will be seen in figures published next month.\nIn order to hit that target, NHS Wales would need to achieve a further 48.4% decrease in the longest waits over the course of a single month.\nThe health secretary has already indicated he believes the NHS will come \"pretty close\" to achieving its goal.\nThe figures also show some variation between health boards on what progress they are making in tackling the longest waits.\nIn February there were still more than 8,300 instances where somebody had waited more than two years in Betsi Cadwaladr Health Board which covers north Wales.\nCwm Taf Morgannwg and Cardiff and Vale health boards each have more than 2,200 instances .\nHowever the figure stands at 829 in Hywel Dda health board which covers west and parts of mid Wales and 280 in the Swansea Bay health board area. Powys health board has no waits of over two years.\nThe NHS in England has virtually eliminated waits of two years or more. \nThe number of two-year waits in each health board in February:\nThe latest figures also show the total size of the NHS waiting list in Wales stood at just over 793,900 in February.\nThis was a decrease of around 2,900 patient pathways - which account for patients who may be on multiple waiting lists - from January, but it is still 74.9% higher than May 2020 during the early part of the Covid pandemic.\nIn a speech to NHS leaders earlier this month, Miles set a new target of decreasing this number by around 200,000 during the coming year and eliminate two-year plus waits completely.\nMore funding is expected to be announced in the coming weeks to help the NHS achieve this but the health secretary warned the Welsh government would seek to claw back additional funding from health boards who fail to meet their targets.\nMeanwhile statistics show ambulance and A&E departments continued to experience significant pressures this spring.\nIn March 50.3% of urgent red calls receiving a response within eight minutes - a deterioration of 0.8% compared to February. The target is 65%.\nIn March, 66.9% of patients in all NHS emergency departments spent less than four hours in the department from arrival until admission, transfer or discharge.\nThis was lower than the previous month. The target of 95% has never been met.\nDuring the same month 10,384 patients waited 12 hours or more. This was 1,437 (16.1%) more than in the previous month. \nMiles said he was \"very happy\" the waiting list had fallen for a third month in a row.\n\"We still have more work to do to reach our ambitious targets, but it is encouraging,\" he added.\nBut Welsh Conservative shadow health secretary James Evans said the statistics \"are worse than a mixed bag\".\nHe added that it was a \"testament to Labour's failure to meet their targets\" that the two-year waits \"still exist at all\".\nMabon ap Gwynfor MS, Plaid Cymru spokesperson on health and care, said the monthly update were \"not statistics to celebrate by any measure\".\n\"Any improvements in the dire statistics are of course welcomed, but let's not pretend that things are good, or anywhere near as they should be,\" he said. \n Addenbrooke's confirms a patient with mpox - formerly known as monkeypox - visited A&E on Saturday.\nGPs will work more closely with specialists to support patients closer to home, the government says.\nThe agreement is designed to ensure more cooperation between nations in the event of another pandemic.\nCampaigners blame a reduction in free vaccine eligibility for the highest death figures in four decades.\nThe suspect, 40, is accused of setting fire to the homes of some of his alleged victims to cover his tracks.\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

      "ml_hf_summary": "In February, the number of patients waiting more than two years for NHS treatment in Wales decreased by over 26% compared to January, falling from 21,087 to 15,505.  This decrease is attributed to efforts focused on \"delivery\" and \"new ways of working,\" according to Health Secretary Jeremy Miles. However, the target of reducing waits to 8,000 by March remains a challenge, requiring further significant reductions in waiting times over the coming months. While some health boards have made progress (e.g., Hywel Dda with 829 cases), others still face high numbers (e.g., Betsi Cadwaladr with over 8,300).  The total NHS waiting list in Wales stood at just over 793,900 in February, a decrease of around 2,900 patient pathways but still significantly higher than pre-pandemic levels. The Welsh government aims to reduce the waiting list by 200,000 and eliminate two-year plus waits by the end of the year.  \n"

I'm proud of them all'\nFrance beat brave Wales to remain on course for title\nEvans is going to need every ounce of that energy as Wales face a resurgent Ireland who arrive in Newport as the fifth best side in the world. \nIreland pushed France all the way in their opening-round defeat, before a convincing victory over Italy.

The comments generated outrage from climate groups and mockery from Albanese.\n\"I believe in climate change, and that it is a reality\" Dutton said while campaigning on Monday. \n During Wednesday's debate, Dutton responded to the moderator's question on whether flooding and natural disasters were getting worse by saying, \"I don't know because I'm not a scientist\". \n\"I can't tell you whether the temperature has risen in Thargomindah because of climate change or the water levels are up,\" he added.\nMeanwhile Albanese, who had said Dutton's words showed \"no acceptance of the science of climate change\" continued mocking his opponent on Thursday, asking \"does he believe in gravity?\" \nEnvironmental organisations have reacted to Dutton's debate remarks with dismay.\nClimate Council CEO Amanda McKenzie told the Guardian \"it's outrageous for a senior political leader to be so out of touch that they claim they \"don't know\" the risks Australians are facing.\"\nA report from the non-profit released earlier this month stated one in 23 properties across the country were found to be at high risk from climate change.\nAustralian Conservation Foundation Chief Executive Kelly O'Shanassy called Dutton's words \"a serious concern\" in an interview with the Canberra Times, adding that \"the next parliament is the last parliament that can get Australia's massive contribution to climate change under control.\"\nAlbanese was also questioned on his climate policy during the debate, though for different reasons. \nThe prime minister has championed renewable energy throughout his time in office, but has faced backlash for rising power bills.\nAsked when fees would fall, the prime minister did not directly reply. Instead, he stressed renewables were the \"cheapest form of power\".\nIn March, Labor announced it would extend a relief system for the bills, providing a further automatic $150AUD ($95;PS72) rebate to households and small businesses. \nThe hour-long debate also saw the two party leaders pressed on other hot button issues for Australia including housing and foreign policy, in particular Australia's relationship to the US.\nAustralia all-rounder Cameron Green explains how his time out injured helped him deal with his chronic kidney condition.\nThe men were found by a rescue helicopter, as was an Australian who is being treated in hospital.\nThe BBC spoke to people in Sydney about Australia's housing crisis and what they'd like to see politicians to do help.\nTwo people, including a teenager, were arrested after the nine-year-old was shot on a farm on Sunday.\nAustralia's housing crisis has hit its worst point in decades, becoming a key issue in the upcoming election.\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

      "content": "The daughter of a disabled woman has said it is cruel her mother is being \"forced to retire\" from the day centre she attends in Downpatrick because of her age.\nMaureen Wyatt, 66, has attended the centre for adults with complex disabilities since 2009 after she suffered a brain injury following a cardiac arrest.\nCiara Burns said she had been told her mother had to leave Ardarragh Day Centre because it was only commissioned to provide support for adults aged 18-65.\nThe South Eastern Health Trust said a \"suitable\" alternative placement had been accepted by Mrs Wyatt and her family after staff worked \"very closely\" to support her transition to an alternative service.\nMs Burns said she did not understand why her mother had to \"retire\" from the centre and was concerned the move to a new centre could have a negative impact on her.\nShe said her mother got \"amazing interaction from the day centre\" and had a great group of friends.\n\"The staff are phenomenal,\" she said. \n\"I really, truly wouldn't want her to go anywhere else.\n\"She goes shopping, she plays bingo, she takes part in all sorts of table-top activities. \n\"They have different outings several times a year.\n\"I think it's very cruel that mummy has this service to fall back on, every day for 16 years, and then all of a sudden it's just not there anymore.\"\nMs Burns said she and her mother had \"reluctantly\" accepted a placement at an alternative elderly day care centre in Newcastle, but would prefer that she continues to attend Ardarragh.\n\"The fact that the quality of care would just continue where it's at would definitely put my mind at ease, and the continuity would suit mummy better,\" she said.\n\"With the nature of her brain injury, I don't know what way a big change like that would affect her.\"\nMs Burns said she had been told her mother will not have to leave Ardarragh Day Centre imminently, but it will definitely be later in 2025.\nShe said a referral had been made for her mother to move to an alternative day centre in Newcastle and the family was waiting to hear how many days she would be able to attend.\nA disability charity told BBC News NI it was aware of hundreds of disabled people like Mrs Wyatt who have had to transition from Disability Services to Older People's Services within a health trust when they reached 65.\nNuala Toman, from Disability Action, said that usually means transitioning from receiving support specifically designed for disabled people, to accessing services catered towards the needs of older people.\n\"Often, the disabled person has spent many years of their lives accessing a day centre, and they have friends, they have relationships, they have activities that they enjoy, and that for them is their world, and it's also the world of their family,\" she said.\nMs Toman said it was an under-researched area, but the transition could be \"very disruptive\" and could sometimes lead to a decline in mental health and well-being.\nShe also questioned why someone should have to transition from a \"service that is working for them\".\n\"Older people services are designed for older people, they're not designed for disabled people.\"\nShe said the charity is calling for a \"system re-think\" and said disability services should be provided for life.\nIn 2022, South Down assembly member Colin McGrath wrote to the then Health Minister Robin Swann about Mrs Wyatt's case.\nThe South Eastern Trust subsequently agreed to allow Mrs Wyatt to attend the day centre for another year, beyond her 65th birthday, however this arrangement will soon end.\nA spokesperson for the South Eastern Trust said it understood the situation was very upsetting for Mrs Wyatt and her family, as well as others in similar situations.\nThe trust said if the centre did not have an upper age limit it would lead to significant delays for younger people waiting to access it.\n\"Over the past year, our staff have worked very closely with Mrs Wyatt and her family to support her transition to an alternative service that will continue to meet her assessed needs,\" the spokesperson said.\n\"The trust is pleased that the suitable placement, which had been identified and offered several months ago, had now been accepted by Mrs Wyatt and her family.\"\nA spokesperson for the Department of Health said it recognised the potential for anxiety and disruption when someone was asked to transition from one support setting to another.\n\"Therefore, all transitions of care need to be well managed through advanced planning and early communication with the service user and, if appropriate, family carers involved in the decision-making as part of the care transition process,\" they said.\nA 58-year-old man was arrested in Londonderry on Thursday and remains in custody.\nA memo from Rory McIlroy's time at school shows how plans were in place in case his golf career did not work out.\nBBC said it is

It had a small putting green on its front lawn.\nHolywood Golf Club was less than a mile away but by his mid-teens, McIlroy was playing at home and abroad.\nThe school memo pointed out he had been selected to play for the European junior Ryder Cup team and had also been invited to take part in a special event in Scotland.\nDated 1 September 2004, the memo stated: \"Last year he (Rory) enjoyed reasonably successful, if modest, academic progress given the considerable time he was away from classes.\"\nMr Stevenson, who was principal between 1998 and 2010, remembers a meeting he had with McIlroy's father, Gerry.\n\"It wasn't unusual for a parent to come to ask to come and see me. What was unusual was that Gerry was asking for Rory to be out of school more often than he was in it,\" he said.\nMr Stevenson suspected he was dealing with \"pushy parents\" but soon accepted he was wrong.\n\"Gerry convinced that it was not the case, because he said 'it's all him, it's all Rory, and we've just been, through his young life, doing every thing we can to help him with his ambition to be a professional golfer'.\n\"I took a decision that if his parents had made these sacrifices and had done all this work on his behalf, that his school needed to do that too.\"\nThe retired principal said that when families, schools and peer groups work well together \"dreams are possible\".\n\"We were taking a risk, it could have fallen apart,\" he admitted.\nAs for the young McIlroy, he remembers him as popular but quite shy.\nHe was single-minded about golf, and it is clear that determination has served him well in the past 20 years.\nMr Stevenson said: \"There's an opportunity to tell kids 'he is your role model'.\n\"Not because he is famous, not because he is successful, not because he is rich - he's all of those things - but he's honest, he has acknowledged the support that he got, and he has failed, fallen down and got back up time and time again.\n\"Those are the lessons that I want our young kids to learn.\"\nThe Sullivan school motto is the Irish phrase Lamh Foisdineach An Uachtar, which means with the gentle hand foremost.\nA 58-year-old man was arrested in Londonderry on Thursday and remains in custody.\nBBC said it is working on plans to have other BBc stations available to those outside the UK and will not close BBC Sounds until then. \nThe County Londonderry fashion designer stepped down as the creative director of Spanish luxury fashion house Loewe in March.\nStakeknife was linked to at least 18 murders while working as an Army agent within the IRA in the 1980s.\nFive incidents of damage to equipment, including throw lines, have been reported in County Tyrone.\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

In 2004, when McIlroy was 15 years old, he had a seven-point plan with his parents and Sullivan Upper School to balance his burgeoning golf career with academics. The school's principal, John Stevenson, worked with McIlroy's family to ensure he received support while pursuing his passion for golf.  The memo from the school reflects their understanding that McIlroy would be away from classes more than usual but also acknowledges the potential for success in both areas.  McIlroy's dedication and determination have led him to achieve a remarkable career, serving as an example of how hard work and support can lead to success. \n"

It's filthy. It's dangerous and someone is going to be seriously hurt.\n\"We need to be more innovative around how we deal with this problem, an overdose prevention facility is the obvious answer to this issue.\"\nIn March, Justice Minister Naomi Long told BBC News NI that the \"war on drugs had not been won\" and there needed to be a rethink of how illegal drugs are dealt with in Northern Ireland.\nThe UK's first and only drug consumption room opened in Glasgow in January.\nThis scheme could only go ahead because Scotland's senior prosecutor, the Lord Advocate, announced a change in policy which meant users would not be prosecuted for possessing illegal drugs while at the facility.\nThe UK government said it had no plans to introduce other consumption rooms but it would not interfere in the Glasgow project.\nGreen Party councillor Brian Smyth said the use of the derelict building site \"shows that there is a clear and growing drugs crisis in Belfast, particularly centred around certain parts of the city centre core\".\nHe added: \"Council staff and organisations such as Extern are constantly removing used needles and other drug waste.\n\"The problem isn't going away and we need to change our approach to drug use and base it around harm reduction.\"\nHe said Belfast \"desperately needs an overdose prevention facility\".\nIf you've been affected by the issues raised in this article, help and support is available via BBC Action Line.\nA 58-year-old man was arrested in Londonderry on Thursday and remains in custody.\nBBC said it is working on plans to have other BBc stations available to those outside the UK and will not close BBC Sounds until then. \nThe County Londonderry fashion designer stepped down as the creative director of Spanish luxury fashion house Loewe in March.\nStakeknife was linked to at least 18 murders while working as an Army agent within the IRA in the 1980s.\nFive incidents of damage to equipment, including throw lines, have been reported in County Tyrone.\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

      "content": "Half a million weapons obtained by the Taliban in Afghanistan have been lost, sold or smuggled to militant groups, sources have told the BBC - with the UN believing that some have fallen into the hands of al-Qaeda affiliates.\nThe Taliban took control of around one million weapons and pieces of military equipment - which had mostly been funded by the US - when it regained control of Afghanistan in 2021, according to a former Afghan official who spoke to the BBC anonymously.\nAs the Taliban advanced through Afghanistan in 2021, many Afghan soldiers surrendered or fled, abandoning their weapons and vehicles. Some equipment was simply left behind by US forces.\nThe cache included American-made firearms, such as M4 and M16 rifles, as well as other older weapons in Afghan possession that had been left behind from decades of conflict.\nSources have told the BBC that, at the closed-door UN Security Council's Sanctions Committee in Doha late last year, the Taliban admitted that at least half of this equipment is now \"unaccounted\" for.\nA person from the committee said they had verified with other sources that the whereabouts of half a million items was unknown.\nIn a report in February, the UN stated that al-Qaeda affiliates, including Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan, the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan, the East Turkestan Islamic Movement, and Yemen's Ansarullah movement, were accessing Taliban-captured weapons or buying them on the black market.\nThe BBC put this to Hamdullah Fitrat, deputy spokesperson for the Taliban government, who told the BBC it took the protection and storage of weapons very seriously.\n\"All light and heavy weapons are securely stored. We strongly reject claims of smuggling or loss,\" he said. \nA 2023 UN report said the Taliban allowed local commanders to retain 20% of seized US weapons, and that the black market was thriving as a result. These commanders are affiliated to the Taliban but often have a degree of autonomy in their regions.\nThe UN noted that the \"gifting of weapons is widely practiced between local commanders and fighters to consolidate power. The black market remains a rich source of weaponry for the Taliban\".\nA former journalist in the city of Kandahar told the BBC that an open arms market existed there for a year after the Taliban takeover, but has since gone underground via the messaging service WhatsApp. On it, wealthy individuals and local commanders trade new and used US weapons and equipment - mostly the weapons left by US-backed forces.\nThe number of weapons recorded by the US body tasked with overseeing Afghan reconstruction projects, known as Sigar, is lower than those cited by our sources, but in a 2022 report it acknowledged it was unable to get accurate information. \nThe reason given for this was that equipment has been funded and supplied by various US departments and organisations over the years. \nSigar added that there had been \"shortfalls and issues with DoD's [Department of Defense] processes for tracking equipment in Afghanistan\" for more than a decade. \nIt also criticised the State Department, adding: \"State provided us limited, inaccurate, and untimely information about the equipment and funds it left behind.\" The department denied this was the case. \nThis is very much a political issue, and US President Donald Trump has repeatedly said that he will reclaim weapons from Afghanistan. He said that $85bn (PS66bn) of advanced weaponry was left there.\n\"Afghanistan is one of the biggest sellers of military equipment in the world, you know why? They're selling the equipment that we left,\" Trump said during his first cabinet meeting of the new administration.\n\"I want to look into this. If we need to pay them, that's fine, but we want our military equipment back.\"\nThe president's figure has been disputed, as money spent in Afghanistan also funded training and salaries. Also, Afghanistan did not feature in the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute's top 25 largest exporters of major arms last year.\nIn response to Trump's comments, Zabihullah Mujahid, the Taliban's chief spokesperson, told Afghan state TV: \"We seized these weapons from the previous administration and will use them to defend the country and counter any threats.\"\nThe Taliban regularly parades US weapons, including at Bagram Airfield, which served as the main US-Nato base, and frame them as symbols of victory and legitimacy.\nAfter withdrawing in 2021, the Pentagon claimed US equipment left in Afghanistan was disabled, but the Taliban have since built a capable military using US weapons and gained superiority over rival groups, such as the National Resistance Front and Islamic State Khorasan Province - the regional affiliate of the Islamic State group.\nA source from the former Afghan government told the BBC that \"hundreds\" of unused Humvees, mine-resistant ambush protected vehicles (MRAPs), and Black Hawk helicopters remain in Kandahar warehouses.\nThe Taliban has showcased some of this captured equipment in propaganda videos, but their ability to operate and maintain advanced machinery, such as Black Hawk helicopters, is limited due to a lack of trained personnel and technical expertise. Much of this sophisticated equipment remains non-operational.\nHowever, the Taliban have been able to utilise more straightforward equipment, like Humvees and small arms, in their operations.\nWhile Donald Trump appears determined to reclaim US weapons from Afghanistan, the former head of Sigar, John Sopko, says such an attempt would be pointless.\nAt a recent event hosted by the Afghan Institute for Strategic Studies, he said that \"the cost would exceed its actual value\".\nWhether Trump will take any action remains to be seen, but, in the meantime, concerns about the spread of weapons in the region and access by militant groups remain unresolved.\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

      "summary": "Ola, once a rising star, is facing falling sales amid rising competition and regulatory scrutiny.",
      "content": "It was once the Indian start-up world's shining star, but Ola is now battling a multitude of crises.\nFounded in 2010, it quickly became a household name, expanding from ride-hailing to electric vehicles and battery cells, challenging Uber along the way.\nThe company jumped on the AI bandwagon in 2023 with Krutrim, India's first AI company valued at over $1bn.\nMarquee global investors such as Japan's SoftBank, US-based Tiger Global and Singapore's Temasek bankrolled this expansion. Last year, Ola's electric vehicles (EV) arm raised close to $734m (PS567m) in a blockbuster initial public offering (IPO), India's biggest in 2024. \nBut this ambitious rise has been accompanied by a series of controversies lately, particularly at its EV arm.\nOla Electric has lost close to 70% of its value in the seven months since the IPO was launched. It is facing competition from more established two-wheeler giants, along with mounting regulatory scrutiny.\nSales of Ola's scooters are down to less than half from April last year and the company's losses have widened. Customers have posted videos on social media of Ola scooters going up in flames or breaking down mid-ride.\nThere's a government inquiry under way at hundreds of newly-opened Ola showrooms regarding licences and registrations. One of its vendors also filed an insolvency plea against the company, which Ola said in a statement to stock exchanges that it had settled.\nThe BBC has learnt from former employees and industry sources that delayed payments have led to many major suppliers and logistics partners ending ties with them.\nOla has been cutting jobs, restructuring operations and automating functions in a bid to reduce costs and trim losses. Media reports say it has undertaken a second round of layoffs since November, with over 1,000 roles axed.\nThe BBC sent detailed questions to Ola about these issues. The company shared links to some of its earlier press statements, not responding specifically to all the queries.\nSo, what's gone wrong?\nOla CEO Bhavish Aggarwal positioned the company as Tesla's two-wheeler equivalent, solving the emissions problem for the price-sensitive Indian market.\nHe poured in millions of marketing dollars, opening Ola showrooms across India, even delivering scooters at the doorstep of people who'd made online bookings.\nBut Ola has struggled to read the market well, says Rohit Paradkar, an analyst with the auto magazine Overdrive. \nIts scooter is modelled on the AppScooter from Etergo, a Dutch start-up that Ola Electric acquired in 2020. \nSeveral former employees told the BBC that Ola's first EV scooter was launched without many changes to Etergo's version. A former employee who worked in the compliance department told the BBC that clearances were rushed through to meet unrealistic launch deadlines. \nIn response to queries, Ola referred to an October 2023 blog post where it addressed the \"myth\" that the vehicle had \"not been engineered and tested for India\". It said it had \"fully re-engineered\" Etergo's scooter and tested it for \"Indian conditions\". \n\"The whole vehicle has been tested at three levels [for India] - digital simulations, component tests and vehicular lab tests, and vehicular field tests,\" it said in the post.\nBut several safety-related incidents reported by customers have raised questions.\nSome scooters began catching fire which, auto experts say, was likely due to short-circuits or faulty battery management system. \nOla recalled more than 1,400 first-generation scooters in 2022 to investigate the fires, but the report was not publicly released. It had then said the battery systems were compliant for Indian and European standards but didn't explain what caused the fires.\nSome riders also reported the front suspension - which holds the wheel in place - breaking mid-ride, causing injuries. \nIn early 2023, after such an accident, Ola called it a rare case, noting there were only a few such issues among 150,000 scooters. \nThe front fork arm, they said, had a significant safety margin for accidents and was designed to handle 80% more load than what it would typically experience during daily use.\nMeanwhile, Ola's rivals - mostly established automakers - have rolled out electric scooters smoothly, adding to the pressure on the company.\nTheir entry shook the market. Ola's share had plunged from 52% to 19% by December, then recovered to 25% in January. \nOla aims to sell 50,000 units monthly to turn profitable, but analysts doubt the target, despite the company saying recent restructuring has helped it achieve $10m monthly savings and faster deliveries.\nGovernment data shows that less than 10,000 scooters were sold in February, but Ola claims 25,000, blaming registration delays due to vendor contract changes. The federal transport ministry has issued notices over the discrepancy. Ola said it had registered over 23,000 scooters sold in March and held a 30% market share for the fiscal year.\nBut competing scooters with fewer features are now outselling Ola simply because they come from trusted, well-established brands, said Jay Kale, executive vice-president and auto analyst at Elara Capital.\nTo push sales, Ola has offered deep discounts, launching newer models at cheaper price points. But losses have widened to $65m in the October-December quarter from $43.6m a year ago.\nBesides product issues, the reliability of its customer service has been another major issue, says Kale.\nWhen angry customers flooded social media and consumer helplines with complaints about the fires and front suspension, their service requests were reportedly unanswered for days.\nAt one point, thousands of complaints were piling up monthly, a former employee at Ola told the BBC. India's consumer rights agency, the Central Consumer Protection Authority (CCPA), also sent a notice to Ola after it got 10,000 complaints over the period of a year.\nBut since Ola had eschewed the established dealer route in a bid to sell directly to buyers and had just a few service centres, aggrieved consumers had few places to turn to.\nLate last year, Ola wrote to the CCPA that it had a \"robust mechanism to address complaints\", and that most raised with the regulator had been satisfactorily resolved.\nAggarwal was initially dismissive of the problems on social media but later announced that Ola would be opening nearly 4,000 stores with service facilities, following a heated public exchange on X with a stand-up comedian who took up the customers' cause.\nA majority of these new centres, however, came under the government's scanner for lacking relevant licences to store and sell vehicles.\nOn 21 March, Ola confirmed investigations in four states and said it was responding to authorities.\nThe sharp turn in Ola's fortunes is making investors - especially those who bought in at high IPO valuations - nervous.\nOla has been a key player in India's push to cut carbon emissions and expand manufacturing.\nIt benefits from two separate state subsidies, one to make scooters and the second to set up its own 20 gigawatt EV battery plant. But Reuters has reported that the costly gigafactory project is delayed and has missed a key milestone, potentially leading to penalties.\nCritics say Ola's troubles emanate from typical culture issues that plague many start-ups - including CEO-driven decision-making, constant pivots and unrealistic, high-pressure deadlines.\n\"Software mindsets don't work with hardware products, which need time to build,\" said Deepesh Rathore, who used to head product strategy at Ola Electric and now runs consultancy firm Insight EV.\nSome top executives across the wider company have quit recently, including a former Ola Cab CEO who quit within months. Key leaders in tech, marketing, sales and business also left last year. \nExperts say the exits have also affected Ola's efforts to fix product and service issues.\nFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, X and Facebook.\nAmbitious economies like Vietnam and Indonesia are stuck between China and the US as the trade war escalates. \nThe company has halted taxi bookings after allegations of fund diversion by India's market regulator.\nThe visit comes as India and US continue high-stakes talks to finalise a bilateral trade deal. \nThe firms said operating expenses have risen \"due to recent changes in global trade rules and tariffs\".\nA new initiative aims to boost the local economy by attracting elderly travellers to remote parts of the country.\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

Ola's direct-to-consumer sales strategy has also been criticized for lacking proper service centers and facing licensing issues.

      "content": "Beijing insists it will stand firm in the face of Donald Trump's tariffs on Chinese goods. It has been trying to reassure everyone that the country is strong and the economy is resilient enough to weather this latest storm.\nBut this week, Chinese officials have acknowledged the potential for economic pain as a result of the unfolding trade war with the US.\nOne option for policymakers here is to try to increase domestic consumption to make up for lost export revenue.\nChina has a massive population and, if they start buying more stuff, Chinese companies won't have to rely as much on trade overseas.\nA key target in this endeavour are retirees with potentially decades of savings.\nNow the government wants them to spend some of it - for the good of the country. \nAnd initiatives like the \"silver trains\" - which are tailored specifically to older travellers - aim to do just that.\nOn board the Star Express, the cocktails are poured and the karaoke microphone is passed around, as retirees party their way through China's south-western Yunnan province. \nThe roast goose is being devoured with shots of baijiu, a Chinese white spirit alcohol.\n\"We have been working hard all these years,\" says 66-year-old Daniel Ling, who is travelling with a group of retired or semi-retired friends.\n\"The important thing when we reach this age, is to know what is the right thing to do - and that is to really enjoy life.\"\nThe initiative hopes to turn an economic problem into an economic solution by giving older people a fun avenue to spend more.\nFamilies are not spending enough because they don't feel financially safe - the property crisis has diminished the value of their number one asset: their home. And growing unemployment has also potentially made their job less secure.\nAdd to the mix an ageing population and low birthrates and the proportion of retirees grows each year, making it harder for the economy to support them.\nBut what retirees do have is time on their hands and money to spend. \nSo now they are to be given more opportunities to splurge with special trains designed to take them to sites they might not normally visit - parts of the country further afield, which need a financial shot in the arm.\n\"The main places where the silver trains will stop are undeveloped rural areas or small towns with struggling economies,\" says Dr Huang Huang, a research associate from the China Tourism Academy who has been studying the potential impact of this plan.\n\"They will consume various products on the trains, but after they pull into a station, they will also visit tourist attractions and traditional villages.\"\nIn Baisha, the travellers stop by the modest street stalls at the bottom of old, two-storey, wooden houses built by the local Naxi ethnic minority.\nOne of them approaches a vendor selling barbecued strips of yak meat. They look tasty and she buys a bagful. The vendor's husband, who is also working at the stall, says this business is only a year old and that they need outside customers to survive.\nAll along this street you can get potatoes with spicy sauce, lamb skewers, fresh orange juice and the traditional clothing of the Naxi people. \nThis is a region where incomes are low and most young people leave when they reach a certain age because there are hardly any jobs for them.\nIt is also not an easy place for many retirees to reach, but these silver trains make it possible, with easy access to boarding and alighting, and with staff to help as well as extra medical support if required.\nShi Lili, 69, whose granddaughter is accompanying her, says the travelling spirit of her youth has been rekindled: \"When I was young I really liked exploring other places by myself. Now I'm older, I have my family who can go with me.\"\nBy the end of last year, 22% of China's population were over the age of 60, making up more than 310 million people.\nSo, if only the smallest percentage of China's retirees take \"silver trains\", it can still mean millions of ticket sales. And China's railway authorities say they plan to be operating 100 routes within the next three years.\nSuch trips alone are not going to fix China's massive challenge with low consumer spending. But economists would say these moves are a step in the right direction. \nOlder citizens now have a much greater desire to travel compared to previous generations, creating \"huge potential\", according to Dr Huang.\n\"Given that China's ageing population is now a reality going into the long run - something which is unlikely to the reversed - we should find more opportunities from this rather than always turning it into a challenge.\"\nBack on board the train, the silver adventurers are ready to crash out. And they can do so knowing that their big day out was - at least partly - for the benefit of all.\nThen it's onto the next town.\nChina is encouraging it's retirees to spend their savings on fun initiatives to help boost its economy, as the country's trade war with the US rages on.\nThe firms said operating expenses have risen \"due to recent changes in global trade rules and tariffs\".\nAs the trade war continues to escalate, China has hit back at Trump by suspending exports of rare earth minerals.\nBBC Verify's Jake Horton looks into the truth behind the claims, and what we know about how luxury goods are made.\nThe shift comes as Beijing refuses to back down in an escalating trade war with Washington.\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

      "ml_hf_summary": "China's government acknowledges potential economic hardship due to ongoing trade tensions with the US, seeking to mitigate this through increased domestic consumption.  A key strategy involves encouraging retirees to spend their savings on travel and leisure activities via \"silver trains\" designed for older travelers. These trains target underdeveloped rural areas and small towns struggling economically, offering opportunities for spending and tourism. The initiative aims to stimulate local economies and address the growing number of retirees who have accumulated significant savings but limited job security.  China's trade war with the US has led to increased operating expenses for businesses, prompting this strategy as a potential solution. \n"

I visited every day... and then, when I went to tell her I had lost, within an hour we had the diagnosis that she would pass away within a month. So it was quite a traumatic time in that regard,\" she said. \nShe added not being an MP anymore meant she was able to spend those last few weeks with her mother, which was a \"privilege\". \nThere has had to be adjustments for her in her new role in Parliament's upper house.\n\"I would say about 90% of the time is spent scrutinising legislation and it is much harder to scrutinise the government. So I have had come to that understanding,\" she said. \nBaroness Coffey also wants to use her position to deal with some \"unfinished business\" from her time as an MP in Suffolk.\nShe said she was considering tabling an amendment to the Planning and Infrastructure Bill due before the Lords shortly and was looking forward to using some of her experiences in Suffolk and as a minister in order to apply some of what she punningly calls \"peer pressure\".\nShe said she wanted to prevent buildings designated as community assets being demolished, and cited the loss of the sports hall and Angel Theatre in Rendlesham as motivations.\nTherese Coffey spent nine years as a minister, starting in the Whips' Office in 2014, holding a number of cabinet roles and also a short, and not uncontroversial spell, as deputy prime minister to Liz Truss.\nOn being a minster, she said: \"That is just constant pressure, which varies. I spent three years at Defra [Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs) initially before going off to join the cabinet and running Work and Pensions during Covid. \n\"So I think it's fair to say it is relentless and... I got ill several years ago. I was just run down. Because it was never ending.\"\nBaroness Coffey had a serious brain infection which put her in hospital.\nIn November 2023, she resigned from the government front bench. \nDuring her time in government, as well as attracting political criticism, Coffey has also been portrayed in the media as someone who likes a few drinks and having a good time. \nA picture of her taken at a party smoking a cigar with a drink stain down the front of her top, looking intoxicated, is regularly republished. \nShe said: \"It was taken at a Spectator summer party on a particularly hot day and I just knew then it was a bad photo. Funnily enough a lot of the national journalists seemed to think it was great and showed I was 'down'. \n\"I knew it was a disaster. But I cannot do anything about it, so I don't worry about it. \n\"It's the reason I started wearing scarves.

Because what you might call diversity, I just call an open door.\"\nAsked on Radio 2's Doctor Who: 20 Secrets from 20 Years if he writes such themes into the show consciously, the Welshman replied: \"I don't even know if it's conscious. That's life, and I think it's the only way to write.\"\nDavies, who also wrote acclaimed TV dramas Queer As Folk and It's A Sin, added that he felt it was harder to write using \"a narrow window\" of references.\n\"Why limit yourself?

And, as far as I know, the core of Doctor Who is kindness, love and doing the right thing.\"\nAddressing the same subject, Gatwa told the Radio Times that their collaboration represented \"progress, in terms of how we reflect the societies that we live in\".\n\"That's something incredible that media can do, and that's what it's doing,\" he added.\n\"But it's also exciting to look forward to a day when [having non-white leads] isn't something huge.\"\nDoctor Who was first broadcast on the BBC in 1963, portrayed by William Hartnell, and the show has undergone many changes in recent years.\nPrevious head writer Chris Chibnall introduced Jodie Whittaker as the first female Doctor in 2017, before Davies chose Gatwa to appear as the show's first black lead star from 2023.\nThere have been unconfirmed reports in recent weeks that Gatwa is set to leave and that the show may be facing the axe. The BBC has said any decision on a new series would be made after the current series ends.\nThe Surrey-based actress appears as Mrs Flood in Ncuti Gatwa's first two seasons as The Doctor. \nThe BBC's \"voice of Eurovision\" will play himself in an episode set at an Interstellar Song Contest.\nShows including Doctor Who and Black Mirror are to return, as videogame South of Midnight is released.\nDoctor Who's new companion Varada Sethu feels getting into the acting industry can be tough for South Asians.\nChris Chibnall gave his first reading of his novel to an audience at Bridport Arts Centre on Monday.\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

And when family budgets are tight, would at least some British supermarkets be keen to offer cheaper American beef or chicken?\nFor now, industry experts say no.\nProfessor David Wain teaches animal welfare at Cirencester's Royal Agricultural University. He told me the \"main drivers\" in the UK meat industry are retailers, demanding higher standards.\nHe said: \"I'm quite sure that our importation requirements would not permit chlorine washing of chicken.\n\"And there is no sign at all that the UK would permit hormone-treated beef.\"\nFollow BBC Gloucestershire on Facebook, X and Instagram.

David Barton, Chair of the National Farmers' Union (NFU), emphasizes that any imported US beef must meet British standards, including the ban on growth hormones.

      "summary": "Former Northampton Town player Graham Carr recalls 17 April 1965 when the club won promotion to the top flight of English football for the first and only time.",
      "content": "Dave Bowen and the Northampton Town squad for the 1965-66 First Division season\nIt will never happen again that a club sharing a ground with a county cricket team will reach the top flight of English football.\nAnd yet that was the reality for Northampton Town, who, on 17 April 1965, sealed promotion to the old First Division with a 4-1 away win at Bury.\nIt capped an outstanding managerial achievement by Dave Bowen, who guided Northampton from the fourth tier to the first in just five seasons - a rise which, by comparison, took Luton Town nine years to emulate in the current century, from 2014 to 2023.\n\"We needed to win at Bury on Easter Saturday. Everybody seemed a little bit nervous, but as the game went on, we got control. Don Martin scored early in the second half and we had a three-goal lead then and we could relax,\" Graham Carr told BBC Look East.\nCarr, who was then only 20, had come into the side during the season, making eight appearances, and was still finding his feet among seasoned professionals.\nBut such was the congested nature of the fixture list, there was little time to enjoy their achievement - that came later at a special dinner hosted by the town's mayor.\n\"After the game, I can't remember celebrating. We were sitting on the bus ready to go and we could hear Dave Bowen talking to Sports Report on the radio,\" said Carr.\n\"On Sunday, we were at Luton Airport, a 16-seater to fly to Exeter to play Plymouth. Derek Legg was sent off early in the game, we were up against it and got beat 5-2. \n\"Then we got the flight back to Luton and the following day we played Plymouth in the return game and won 3-1. We played three games in four days with the same players. No subs then. If you were injured you stayed on.\"\nFootball club to mark 5,000th league game\nWales and Northampton great Bowen honoured with bust\nGraham Carr returned to Northampton as an associate director in 2017\nNorthampton finished the season in second place with 56 points from their 42 games - only two for a win in those days - and were just a single point behind champions Newcastle United.\nAnd promotion meant that in the following season, the Cobblers would be mixing it with the likes of Liverpool, Manchester United, Tottenham Hotspur, Arsenal and Leeds United.\nCarr believes that much of the credit must go to Bowen, who was first appointed in 1959 following two spells as a player with the club, and also spent 10 years as manager of the Wales national team.\n\"Dave Bowen was a marvellous coach and he was out with us every day training. He had a plan for everything,\" he said.\n\"There was good recruitment and we played the same system every game, every week, two wingers - right-footed right winger, left-footed left winger - two strikers, back four, we always had balance in the side.\"\nThose wingers were principally Harry Walden and Tommy Robson, later to become a club legend for rivals Peterborough United, with Robson reaching double figures for goals, along with Don Martin and Bobby Brown. \nNorthampton Town's pitch at the County Ground was used as a car park during the summer months\nBut how much of an advantage was Northampton's unusual ground?\nThe club had shared the playing area with Northamptonshire CCC since 1905 and went through the entire campaign without losing a single game at home, where they only conceded 16 goals in 21 fixtures. \n\"Everybody loved playing there. It was our Wembley really. Even with the set-up (we had), I never heard any player want to leave,\" said Carr. \n\"We never did warm-ups like they do now, we rubbed oil on (our legs in the changing room) and ran onto the pitch. You didn't see the build-up of people coming into the ground. \n\"You couldn't help but think 'wow', I'm ready for it' with the people on the cricket side tight to you, down the side, it became a close, tight atmosphere. Other clubs would feel they were up against it. It played its part for us.\"\nThe promotion season ended with a home game against Portsmouth, an unforgettable occasion for those who were there.\n\"'It was a big deal, the town was only half the size it is now so everyone knew everyone. None of us could believe it was happening,\" supporter Roger Averill told BBC Look East.\n\"The last game against Portsmouth, I was in the middle of the hotel end which was packed. I had to climb up the floodlights so I could see. It was party time. I don't think I appreciated the magnitude of it. \n\"It was heaving. Everyone went on the pitch, the players went into the stand, throwing shirts and boots into the crowd. As a 12-year-old, I thought we would do this all the time but I have found out that we don't!\"\nRoger Averill has been a Northampton supporter since the early 1960s\nNorthampton were handed a trip to Merseyside to take on Everton for their first match in the top flight, and it proved to be a harsh lesson as, although Bobby Brown's goal brought them level at 1-1, they eventually went down 5-2.\n\"It was the first year subs came in. We played at Everton, I remember driving in and I knew I was (going to be) on the bench,\" Carr recalls. \"The crowd outside Goodison Park was unbelievable.\"\nThere was encouragement from their first two home games, which ended in 1-1 draws with Arsenal and defending champions Manchester United, Matt Busby's side helping attracting a crowd of 21,245 to the County Ground.\nThings then took a downturn as the Cobblers failed to win any of the next 10, leaving them 21st by mid-October, but back-to-back 2-1 home victories over West Ham and Aston Villa lifted the mood, with Jim Hall scoring both goals in the latter.\nResults were mixed thereafter but the Cobblers managed to stay just above the bottom two despite 6-2 defeats in the return game with Manchester United at Old Trafford and at Stoke City in February.\nNewcastle United and Leeds United were both beaten at home and they completed a notable double over Villa when John Mackin and Graham Moore's goals gave them a 2-1 win.\nThe final three games were a rollercoaster as a 4-2 home loss to Fulham dropped them into the relegation places, a 2-1 home win over Sunderland lifted them out, only for a 3-0 defeat at Blackpool to see them finish 21st, just three points from safety, and they were relegated along with Blackburn Rovers.\nThey had certainly not disgraced themselves, winning 10 games and drawing 13, but defensive frailty ultimately cost them dear. Their 92 goals conceded was four worse than any other team.\n\"We had great lads who were physically strong, who would work hard and dig in - and frighten people - but in the First Division then, you did need a little more than that,\" said Carr. \n\"Unfortunately, we didn't have the money to do it - we did our best but our best wasn't good enough.\"\nCarr left Northampton in 1968 to join York City but returned as manager in the mid-1980s and and guided them to the Fourth Division title in 1987.\nHe went on to become chief scout for both Tottenham Hotspur and Newcastle United before deciding to return to Northampton as an associate director eight years ago.\nNow 80, how does he feel looking back to that glorious season which culminated in promotion 60 years ago and the players with whom he shared a dressing room, the majority of whom have passed away?\n\"It was a marvellous feeling, unbelievable. A once-in-a-lifetime achievement. I don't think it will ever happen again because finances have changed this game,\" an emotional Carr added.\n\"We all lived in Northampton so we had a drink together, we socialised together, we went to the cafes together after training.\n\"They were all great lads. I miss them.\" \n'I don't think I have ever seen a game like that' - Man Utd reach Europa League semis\nMaguire scores last-minute winner as Man Utd beat Lyon in nine-goal classic\nSolanke penalty enough as Spurs edge into semi-finals\nRick Stein explores age-old traditions and modern tastes\nThe wild origins of the modern-day rollercoaster\nJohn Simm stars in the provocative 90s drama, The Lakes\nCan Shrek contend with his new in-laws?\nWorld Handicap System manipulators are cheats - R&A\nGetting the meals right - Green on kidney condition & Ashes hopes\nAn average of 13.66 - is Rohit on the decline?\nA fluffed Panenka, controversy & 'statement win' for Arsenal\n'The message will be clear - it's time for Ancelotti to move on'\nWho will win Champions League?

      "content": "Exclusive: backbenchers may be allowed to abstain, a major climbdown from previous votes when rebels were suspended from the party\nMinisters are scrambling to avoid a damaging rebellion this summer when MPs vote on controversial cuts to disability benefit payments, even offering potential rebels the chance to miss the vote altogether.\nThe government is due to hold a vote in June and dozens of Labour MPs are worried it will hurt their constituents and could cost them their seats.\nPossible solutions include allowing backbenchers to abstain - a major climbdown from earlier votes, when rebels were disciplined or suspended from the party. Ministers are also looking for ways to mitigate the cuts with extra spending on measures to tackle child poverty, including extra benefits payments for poorer parents of children under five.\nOne Labour MP said: \"When people abstained on the winter fuel vote, they were warned that it had been taken by the leadership as voting against the government. This time, however, a number of MPs have been offered the opportunity to abstain.\"\nGovernment sources said whipping arrangements had not yet been decided for the vote in two months' time, but did not deny that potential rebels had been offered the opportunity to abstain.\nThe cuts to benefits have become one of the biggest sources of tension within the Labour party since it came to power. In recent months, backbenchers have been stripped of potential privileges for abstaining on a vote to remove the household cap on winter fuel payments, while several were suspended last summer for defying the whip over the two-child benefit cap.\nThe vote in June over PS4.8bn worth of cuts to disability payments is expected to trigger an even bigger backlash from within the parliamentary party. Disgruntled backbenchers say as many as 55 MPs are prepared to rebel at that vote, with more than 100 others still considering their position. Recent analysis by the Disability Poverty Campaign Group showed more than 80 Labour MPs have a majority which is smaller than the number of their constituents who could lose some or all of their benefits.\nLabour backbenchers are also irritated that they are being asked to vote on the package without an assessment from the Office for Budget Responsibility on how effective the government's back to work scheme will prove. One MP said: \"The obvious truth is that people will lose money under these proposals - including those who clearly don't deserve to. This can't simply be spun away. The mood in Westminster may seem calm, but this issue isn't going to fade quietly.\"\nAs well as offering MPs a chance to abstain on June's vote, ministers are hoping to win favour among backbenchers with a separate package on child poverty which is likely to propose increasing benefits for poorer parents of young children.\nLiz Kendall, the work and pensions secretary, will announce the government's child poverty strategy about the same time as the benefits vote, and is looking for ways to lift children out of poverty without entirely removing the two-child benefit cap. Kendall recently told the Mirror she would consider it a personal failure if child poverty was not lower by the next election.\nThe Guardian revealed this year Kendall was particularly interested in proposals to boost the incomes of parents of children under five, which is likely to cost less than the PS3.6bn it would take to remove the cap altogether.\nOfficials are looking at a suggestion promoted by the Fabian Society thinktank to increase universal credit payments for parents of babies and toddlers.\nThe group found that ministers could reduce child poverty by 280,000 by doubling the child element of universal credit for those with children under one, while raising it by 50% for those with children between one and four. Doing so would give parents of babies an extra PS293 per month, and those of toddlers an extra PS146 per month, at a cost of PS2.4bn a year.\nAlternatively, increasing the payment by PS20 a week for those with babies and PS10 a week for those with toddlers would lift 80,000 children out of poverty at a cost of PS715m a year.\nThe Fabians recommended paying for the move by reducing or ending the marriage tax allowance, through which married couples can share part of their tax-free allowance.\nOfficials said they were looking at any suggestion that could be shown to take children out of poverty. One said: \"There are a lot of discussions and options on the table for what that might look like.\"\nMinisters held a series of meetings with MPs to discuss the welfare changes in the days before the Easter recess in an attempt to take the wind out of any rebellion this summer.\nAt the same time, anti-poverty charities are holding private briefings for MPs to lay out the likely implications of the welfare reductions.\nOne MP said the sessions they had became a forum for backbenchers to vent their anger at the government's actions. \"There is a serious depth of concern about how we got into this mess,\" they said. \"There's a growing sense of frustration that the leadership simply isn't listening.\"\nOthers in the party have become irritated at what they see as an organised campaign to exaggerate the impact of the changes. \"The network tend to get together, message each other and get terribly worried about these proposals,\" said one MP. \"But nothing that's been sent to me has given me hard evidence of cases that are at risk of really losing out.\"",
      "ml_hf_summary": "In June, the UK government will hold a vote on controversial cuts to disability benefit payments, potentially triggering a significant rebellion within the Labour party.  Dozens of Labour MPs are concerned about the impact these cuts will have on their constituents and fear potential backlash from voters. To mitigate this, the government is considering offering backbenchers the option to abstain from voting, a move that represents a significant shift from previous disciplinary measures against dissenting MPs. The government also plans to introduce a separate package aimed at reducing child poverty through increased benefits for poorer parents of young children.  The potential cost of these initiatives is estimated to be around £2.4 billion and £715 million respectively. Anti-poverty charities are actively engaging with Labour MPs to inform them about the potential consequences of the welfare changes, while some backbenchers express frustration at what they perceive as a lack of genuine concern from the government leadership regarding their concerns. \n"

      "content": "Manchester United unveiled a first ever tifo that declared, \"Never Gonna Stop\", then did precisely this by knocking out 10-man Lyon in an electrifying close to extra-time.\nIn the first period Rayan Cherki and Alexandre Lacazette had put the French two ahead. But, now, drama: Casemiro went down and Sandro Scharer, ordered to the monitor, awarded a penalty Bruno Fernandes scored.\nThen, in the last minute of extra-time Kobbie Mainoo made it 6-6 on aggregate before Harry Maguire headed the winner. Cue utter bedlam as Old Trafford erupted, and so United head to Spain for a semi-final with Athletic Bilbao: after this, will anyone wager against them reaching the showpiece at the same venue in May?\nWith the host broadcaster's cameras fixed on him before kick-off Andre Onana hoped to quieten the scrutiny via a far quieter night than last week's personal fiasco. The wish was granted, in the early phases, as bursts from Leny Yoro plus slick back-to-front football from Patrick Dorgu, Noussair Mazraoui, Maguire and Manuel Ugarte kept the ball away from his zone.\nClever interplay, too, between Diogo Dalot and Fernandes claimed a corner United's captain swung in: the delivery disappointed but the Portuguese soon improved as he was instrumental in Ugarte's opener. Here, Mazraoui flipped the ball to Fernandes as he cruised along the right. The ball was relayed for Garnacho as the winger, moving over from his left-sided berth, ran in a near-post area. His pass to Ugarte was as precise as the No 25's left-foot finish that sent the home congregation into raptures.\nLyon, as rattled as Onana was at their stadium, vied with further disaster when Corentin Tolisso dawdled and Casemiro took over. The captain tried to recover, failed, and was grateful to Lucas Perri for the goalkeeper's save from Casemiro.\nUnited were in a smart and fast mode that put Lyon under siege. But they failed to capitalise and so the Frenchmen breathed easier and, then, thrust at their host. A series of raids were launched into United's area which had Amorim's men buckling. Cherki saw a shot ping off Maguire for a corner. Georges Mikautadze slipped in towards the spot, Maguire hoofed clear. Nicolas Tagliafico's effort was deflected out for another corner. At this, taken by Cherki, Paul Akouokou rose and headed and Onana saved. Then came the clearest opening: Tagliaficao crossed, Yoro miskicked, and Ainsley Maitland-Niles, roving in behind, snatched at the chance to equalise.\nLyon had United in a chokehold. When Cherki danced through and unloaded a goal seemed certain but Onana flew low and right and pushed out the ball and his side survived.\nNow, United roared back in a moment which thrilled. Dalot fashioned a long parabola from his half and Fernandes, running forward, stretched to power a spectacular volley that left Perri a spectator and crashed off the bar, drawing \"oohs\" from the crowd. More followed when Rasmus Hojlund swivelled and fed the irrepressible Fernandes: again the attempt beat Perri, but this time the attempt spiralled wide.\nUnited hurtled into the break like a train, as the period finished perfectly for them with a second. This was route-one stuff, in high-class fashion. Maguire, deep in his territory, dropped a 70-yard pass supremely into Dalot. The wing-back shrugged off Tagliafico, then coolly rolled home, off Perri's right post.\nSign up to Football Daily\nKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of football\nafter newsletter promotion\nMazraoui, perhaps injured, was replaced by Luke Shaw as the second-half whistle blew, as Garnacho continued to be a dagger in Lyon, claiming a free-kick via a lightning thrust. The Argentinian can lack composure but he was uber-calm when sprinting in after a Hojlund defence-splitter. Entering the area, an amateur was made of his marker, he steadied, and blazed at goal, only Perri's acrobatics stopping a certain third.\nSoon, he nearly rued this, as Tolisso stole an inch in United's area, and the score would have been 2-1 but for excellent Onana reflexes. If Lyon could pull one back, a grandstand finish would be in store. Mikautadze might have done the trick but the No 69 slashed the ball wide in a moment as panicked as Dalot's was slick when, moments later, he again bested Tagliafico. Suddenly he was in Lyon's area and crossing but no teammate could prosper.\nFrom the Stretford End came the \"Ruben Amorim, he'll bring the glory days again\" song and, as Lyon fans lit red flares, the continental dream remained firmly on.\nBut, now, a Lyon roar as Lacazette beat Onana with a header and Tolisso nodded in.\nUnited were in disarray: a Maitland-Niles laser was repelled by a desperate Onana leg but he could do nothing to stop Tagliafico's equaliser, the No 1 exposed by shoddy defending.",

      "content": "Exclusive: Henry Dimbleby joins farmers in voicing fears of lower standards and a poor deal for British food producers\nBritain's rural communities could be \"destroyed\", the former government food tsar has said, if ministers sign a US trade deal that undercuts British farming standards.\nMinisters are working on a new trade deal with the US, after previous post-Brexit attempts stalled. Unpopular agreements signed at the time with Australia and New Zealand featured tariff-free access to beef and lamb and were accused of undercutting UK farmers, who are governed by higher welfare standards than their counterparts. Australia, in a trade deal signed by Liz Truss in late 2021 that came into effect in 2023, was given bespoke sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) standards aimed to not be more \"trade-restrictive than necessary to protect human life and health\".\nBut the tariffs recently imposed by the US president, Donald Trump, combined with a push from the UK's Labour government for economic growth, have caused ministers to redouble efforts to expedite a deal, which is expected, say some sources, within weeks. The UK is currently subject to the blanket 10% tariff Trump imposed on the world, and of 25% on aluminium, steel and cars.\nThere are fears from some sectors that the US deal being drawn up will give the US access to the UK agriculture market and lead to a similar situation. The US side is reported to be pressuring the UK to weaken SPS standards and give tariff-free access to some meat products.\nThe business secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, has ruled out imports of food such as hormone-fed beef and chlorine-washed chicken, and said there are US products that currently meet trade standards.\nBut Henry Dimbleby, who wrote the previous government's food strategy, has joined farmers in warning against an unfavourable deal for UK food producers.\nDimbleby said: \"There is no point in creating a way of farming in this country that produces nutritious food, restores the environment and has high levels of animal welfare, and then import food that is produced in ways that would be illegal for our farmer - you just export those harms abroad, and in the meantime destroy our rural communities. The government has been clear that it will not do this, and it must stick to that promise.\"\nThe Labour MP Clive Lewis urged ministers to align with the EU rather than sacrifice standards in agriculture for a US trade deal.\nHe told the Guardian: \"Since Brexit, the UK has begun drifting from the EU's higher food and environmental standards. Now we face pressure from a US administration that champions deregulated, corporate-led agriculture, demanding access for products that are more processed and of lower standard. So when ministers talk about trade generating 'growth', we have to ask: growth for whom? Certainly not for British farmers, food security or the environment.\n\"The UK must pivot back toward Europe - towards high standards, democratic accountability and trade policies that serve people, not just profits.\"\nSign up to Down to Earth\nThe planet's most important stories. Get all the week's environment news - the good, the bad and the essential\nafter newsletter promotion\nFarmers, already furious at the government for changes to inheritance tax on agricultural land, are expected to bring fresh protests if such a deal goes ahead.\nThe National Farmers' Union president, Tom Bradshaw, said: \"There are serious concerns that the US administration is pressuring the UK government to weaken its SPS standards as a concession for lower tariffs or as part of a new trade deal. This could lead to imports of products that would be illegal for our farmers to produce domestically.\n\"British farmers and growers uphold some of the highest standards in the world. The public has shown time and time again that they want the beef, pork and chicken they buy produced responsibly and not using methods that were rightly banned in the UK decades ago.\"\nMartin Lines, the chief executive of the Nature Friendly Farming Network, added: \"The government was elected on a promise not to undermine UK food standards through imported products, and it is absolutely critical that they stick to that. We cannot ask British farmers to maintain high environmental and animal welfare standards while opening the door to imports produced under significantly weaker regulations.\"\nA spokesperson for the Department for Business and Trade said: \"The US is an indispensable ally and negotiations on an economic prosperity deal that strengthens our existing trading relationship continue. We will only ever sign trade agreements which align with the UK's national interests and we will never lower our high food standards.\"",
      "ml_hf_summary": "The UK government is negotiating a new trade deal with the US, raising concerns among farmers and experts about potential negative impacts on British food production standards.  Former food tsar Henry Dimbleby warns that weakening agricultural standards could harm rural communities and undermine public trust in food products.

Labour MP Clive Lewis urges the UK to align with EU standards rather than sacrificing them for a US deal, emphasizing the potential negative consequences for British farmers and environmental protection.

      "content": "The pivotal 'barbarian conspiracy' of AD367 saw Picts, Scotti and Saxons inflicting crushing blows on Roman defences\nA series of exceptionally dry summers that caused famine and social breakdown were behind one of the most severe threats to Roman rule of Britain, according to new academic research.\nThe rebellion, known as the \"barbarian conspiracy\", was a pivotal moment in Roman Britain. Picts, Scotti and Saxons took advantage of Britain's descent into anarchy to inflict crushing blows on weakened Roman defences in the spring and summer of AD367.\nSenior Roman commanders were captured or killed, and some soldiers reportedly deserted and joined the invaders. It took two years for generals dispatched by Valentinian I, emperor of the western half of the Roman empire, to restore order. The last remnants of official Roman administration left Britain about 40 years later.\nWarning of the possible consequences of drought today, Tatiana Bebchuk, a researcher at Cambridge's department of geography, said: \"The relationship between climate and conflict is becoming increasingly clear in our own time, so these findings aren't just important for historians. Extreme climate conditions lead to hunger, which can lead to societal challenges, which eventually lead to outright conflict.\"\nThe study, published in Climatic Change, used oak tree-ring records to reconstruct temperature and precipitation levels in southern Britain during and after the barbarian conspiracy. Combined with surviving Roman accounts, the data led the authors to conclude that severe summer droughts were a driving force.\nLittle archaeological evidence for the rebellion existed, and written accounts from the period were limited, said Charles Norman of Cambridge's department of geography. \"But our findings provide an explanation for the catalyst of this major event.\"\nSouthern Britain experienced an exceptional sequence of remarkably dry summers from AD364 to 366, the researchers found. In the period AD350-500, average monthly reconstructed rainfall in the main growing season was 51mm. But in AD364, it fell to 29mm. AD365 was even worse with 28mm, and the rainfall the following year was still below average at 37mm.\nProf Ulf Buntgen of Cambridge's department of geography said: \"Three consecutive droughts would have had a devastating impact on the productivity of Roman Britain's most important agricultural region. As Roman writers tell us, this resulted in food shortages with all of the destabilising societal effects this brings.\"\nThe researchers identified no other major droughts in southern Britain in the period AD350-500 and found that other parts of north-west Europe escaped these conditions.\nBy AD367, the population of Britain was in the \"utmost conditions of famine\", according to Ammianus Marcellinus, a soldier and historian.\nNorman said the poor harvests would have \"reduced the grain supply to Hadrian's Wall, providing a plausible motive for the rebellion there, which allowed the Picts into northern Britain\".\nThe study suggested that grain deficits may have contributed to other desertions in this period, and therefore a general weakening of the Roman army in Britain.\nSign up to Headlines UK\nGet the day's headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morning\nafter newsletter promotion\nMilitary and societal breakdown provided an ideal opportunity for peripheral tribes, including the Picts, Scotti and Saxons, to invade the province.\nAndreas Rzepecki, from the Rhineland-Palatinate General Directorate for Cultural Heritage in Trier, said: \"The prolonged and extreme drought seems to have occurred during a particularly poor period for Roman Britain, in which food and military resources were being stripped for the Rhine frontier.\n\"These factors limited resilience, and meant a drought-induced, partial-military rebellion and subsequent external invasion were able to overwhelm the weakened defences.\"\nThe researchers expanded their climate-conflict analysis to the entire Roman empire for the period AD350-476. They reconstructed the climate conditions immediately before and after 106 battles and found that a statistically significant number of battles were fought following dry years.",
      "ml_hf_summary": "A new study published in Climatic Change suggests that severe summer droughts in southern Britain during the AD360s, specifically from AD364 to 366, played a crucial role in the \"barbarian conspiracy\" rebellion against Roman rule.  This drought led to famine and societal unrest, weakening Roman defenses and allowing Picts, Scotti, and Saxons to launch attacks. The study used oak tree-ring records and Roman accounts to reconstruct climate conditions and found that three consecutive years of below-average rainfall devastated agricultural production in the region. This resulted in food shortages and a weakened Roman army, creating an environment ripe for rebellion.  The researchers also found a statistically significant correlation between dry years and battles fought within the Roman empire from AD350 to 476, suggesting a recurring link between climate change and conflict. \n"

      "content": "Italy's prime minister and president spoke a common language - but for a discordant moment over Ukraine\nShe had been welcomed to the White House with open arms as few other foreign visitors had been since Donald Trump's return, and Giorgia Meloni wanted to assure her host that - at least when it came to their political worldview - they spoke a common language.\nItaly's prime minister, whose Brothers Of Italy party has roots in neo-fascism, was keen to stress that she shared many things with the man who had just hailed her as a \"friend\" who \"everybody loves ... and respects\".\nTariffs were a bit of problem. But between friends? Hey, we can work it out.\nEven if Italy boasted one of Europe's biggest trade surpluses with the US, such disagreements could be bridged with recourse to the previously uncoined creed of \"western nationalism\", argued Meloni, speaking in confident, lightly-accented English, although she admitted she did not know if it was \"the right word\".\n\"I know that when I speak about west mainly, I don't speak about geographical space. I speak about the civilization, and I want to make that civilization stronger,\" she said, in terms that the president and his attendant cabinet members-cum-courtiers surely lapped up.\n\"So I think even if we have some problems between the two shores of the Atlantic, it is the time that we try to sit down and find solutions.\"\nAfter all, Meloni pointed out, they were on the same side when it came to one existential struggle, \"the fight against the woke and ADI [sic] ideology that would like to erase our history.\"\nThe acronym was a bit confusing. Did she mean DEI? But no matter, her audience got the general gist.\nMeloni, 48, has been labelled \"Europe's Trump whisperer\" - deemed capable of awakening the concealed angels of his nature that other Euro-leaders cannot reach. She has spent time at Mar-a-Lago, Trump's Florida home, and was the only European leader invited to his inauguration in January.\nHere, in the Oval Office, the whispering was having a soothing effect. The president smiled indulgently, before going off on several \"weaves\" during which he attacked Joe Biden, the federal reserve chair, Jerome Powell, for not cutting interest rates, Biden again, \"activist judges\" who were blocking his deportation agenda, then Powell once again.\nBut it was standard Trump. The man who had publicly brow-beaten Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Ukraine's president, and barely tolerated Emmanuel Macron and Keir Starmer on their White House visits was the very picture of a gracious host.\nEven JD Vance - whose boorish interventions blew up the Zelenskyy visit and nearly did the same to Starmer's - kept his trap shut, proof indeed that all was going swimmingly.\nThen disaster threatened.\nAn Italian journalist insisted on asking the prime minister a question in her native Italian. Mama Mia!\nMeloni looked disgusted. Weren't they all supposed to be western nationalists here, defenders of the same civilization. Why emphasize differences?\nShe played along reluctantly, her features relaxing slightly as she embarked on an extended discourse but her body language betraying her as she lifted both feet off the ground, one crossed leg folding behind the other. Trump watched her intently all the while.\nWhen she finished, an American journalist tried to ask another question but Trump interjected: \"No, wait, I want to hear what you said.\"\nIt was over to Meloni's female interpreter, sitting nearby, who revealed: \"Prime Minister Meloni was asked ... what she thinks about the fact that President Trump holds Zelenskyy responsible for the war in Ukraine.\"\nIt was a discordant, yet key, moment - and the prime minister knew it. As the interpreter tried to continue, Meloni - perhaps sensing this was unsafe territory, not least because she has, for the most part, stuck with the western support for Ukraine that Trump is on the brink of abandoning - took over interpreting her own answer.\nShe limited her explanation to vowing to raise Italy's contributions to Nato, currently at below 1.5% - well below the 2% minimum agreed, and far short of the 5% Trump has lately demanded.\nThen it was the president's turn. \"I don't hold Zelenskyy responsible,\" he said, a retreat from his previous false accusations that Ukraine started the war. \"But I'm not exactly thrilled with the fact that that war started. I'm not happy with anybody involved.\"\nIf anybody was to blame, he went on, it was Biden - the default scapegoat for every wrong - because, after all, everyone knew the war would never have started if he had still been president.\nNo blame was attached to \"President Putin\", the man who actually was responsible for starting the war. \"Now I'm trying to get him to stop,\" said Trump.\nFor the unfortunate Zelenskyy, widely praised across the west for standing steadfast in defense of his country when it was under attack, there was little charity.\n\"I'm not blaming him. But what I'm saying is that I don't think he's done the greatest job, okay? I'm not a big fan, I'm really not.\"\nIt was a telling moment of just how far the west's center of gravity had shifted in the few short weeks since Trump's return to power. And an uncomfortable one, even for Meloni.\nThen the conversation moved onto to the common ground of combatting migration - and it was back to the whispering again.",
      "ml_hf_summary": "Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni met with US President Donald Trump at the White House.  Meloni emphasized shared values between Italy and the US, particularly in their opposition to \"woke\" ideology and a desire for stronger Western civilization. However, during a question about Ukraine's role in the war, Meloni was asked about her opinion on Zelenskyy's responsibility for the conflict. She responded by emphasizing Italy's commitment to NATO contributions, while Trump defended his stance that he doesn't hold Zelenskyy responsible for the war and blamed Biden for its start. The conversation then shifted to migration as a common ground. \n"

      "content": "Pope's surprise public outings after serious illness show he is saying 'I'm here, and I'm in charge', a Vatican expert says\nLorena Araujo Pineiro was putting the finishing touches to the restoration of the 17th-century tomb of Pope Urban VIII, a dark bronze and gold monument in St Peter's Basilica, when she noticed a man wearing a striped poncho-like top, black trousers and no shoes, being pushed in a wheelchair towards her.\n\"It was around noon and the basilica was practically empty,\" said Pineiro, a restorer. \"I struggled to recognise who it was ... I thought he was a simple pilgrim. It was as if he'd just got out of bed.\"\nThe man in the wheelchair was Pope Francis, who had come by to thank Pineiro and her colleague, Michela Malfanti, for their work.\nIt was the second time in a few days that the pontiff, who almost died in February during a severe bout of pneumonia, had made a surprise public appearance since being discharged from hospital on 23 March, defying doctors' orders to rest for at least two months. On the first occasion he appeared at Sunday mass in St Peter's Square. He also privately met King Charles and Queen Camilla during their state visit to Italy.\nFrancis delegated cardinals to lead Holy Week liturgies, although he maintained the Maundy Thursday tradition of visiting inmates at Rome's Regina Coeli prison, and is expected to make another appearance during Easter Sunday mass.\nBut the jaunt to the basilica from his home next door in Casa Santa Marta was daring. Not only was he without his traditional papal robes - something that irked the more conservative faction of the Catholic church - but Francis, who is using a nasal cannula to help him breathe, readily shook hands with both restorers, as well as a child who was in the basilica.\n\"We hesitated to approach him as we thought he might have felt a little ashamed because he wasn't officially dressed,\" said Pineiro. \"But he didn't care. He seemed like a very happy, curious person.\"\nThe Vatican's spokesperson said the next day that the outings were proof that the pope's health is improving.\nBut there are possibly other motives at play. \"If you think back to when he was elected pope and decided to forgo the traditional vestments and to live in Casa Santa Marta, he came in as a maverick,\" said Christopher White, Vatican correspondent for the National Catholic Reporter. \"Now, at 88, and after a very serious hospitalisation, he continues to be a maverick.\"\nWhite believes the reasons are twofold: \"One, he really does believe that being with people is the best medicine. As a pastor, he has a duty to be out and public-facing,\" he said. \"But I also think there's a political calculation. He's politically astute and would have read the papers and all the endless speculation about his health, possible resignation and conclave. I think he's trying to channel pretty concrete ways of saying 'I'm here, and I'm in charge'.\"\nPope Francis has pushed the limits throughout his papacy, for example going to Iraq in 2021 despite being strongly advised against it because Covid-19 was still raging and the security risks were high. He revealed in his autobiography, Hope, published in January, that he escaped a double suicide bombing during the trip after the attempts on his life were foiled by British intelligence and Iraqi police.\nHe embarked on more than 40 overseas trips and kept up a busy schedule before his hospitalisation.\nMeanwhile, the Catholic church is in the midst of a Jubilee year, with millions of pilgrims visiting Rome. Another significant event - the canonisation of Carlo Acutis, the church's first millennial saint - takes place on 27 April.\n\"He keeps pushing the limits to see how much he can do,\" said Robert Mickens, a Vatican commentator. \"Whether that's a wise thing to do or not, that's up to other people ... but he realises that it's very unlikely he will get back to where he was before he went into hospital. Easter is a big holiday with lots of pilgrims expecting to see him, so he's thinking, 'let's just do it'.\"\nJavier Martinez-Brocal, Vatican correspondent for the Spanish newspaper ABC, and author of the book Conclave: the Rules For Electing the Next Pope, said that after Francis's near-death experience, the pope just wanted to \"live in the present\".\n\"He probably feels strong and thinks it's useless to be locked up indoors,\" he said. \"So he thinks these are reasonable risks to take. He wants to show that he's still present, and to see how far he can push it.\"",
      "ml_hf_summary": "Pope Francis made two surprise public appearances after recovering from a severe bout of pneumonia in February.  He visited the tomb of Pope Urban VIII in St Peter's Basilica on March 23rd and was seen shaking hands with restorers and a child. These outings defied doctors' orders for him to rest for at least two months, and he is expected to make another appearance during Easter Sunday mass. The Vatican spokesperson stated that these appearances indicate his health is improving.  Experts believe Francis may be motivated by a desire to connect with people and maintain his public image as well as a political calculation to counter speculation about his resignation or conclave. \n"

      "content": "Officials promise to track down and prosecute those who 'tag' city's historic monuments, statues and grand buildings\nIn Paris's central Place de la Republique, the magnificent lions at the feet of the statue of Marianne are once again covered in graffiti.\nAlong the nearby Boulevard Saint-Martin - part of the Grands Boulevards that bisect the north of the city - the trunk of every plane tree has been crudely sprayed with a name.\nThe front of majestic stone apartment buildings, some dating back more than 200 years, are similarly \"tagged\" with stylised initials or names. So are the benches, flower boxes, front doors, post boxes and the plinth under the bust of the half British 19th-century playwright Baron Taylor. In fact, anything that does not move has been tagged.\nNow Paris city hall has declared war on the vandals and promised to track them down, prosecute and seek fines for some of the estimated EUR6m (PS5.1m) of damage they cause every year.\nThe latest anti-tag campaign is being waged by Ariel Weil, the mayor of France's central district covering the first to fourth arrondissements on the right bank of the Seine. Weil is particularly infuriated by the repeated vandalism to the Marianne, the female symbol of the nation and a listed historic monument.\n\"I've asked police to use cameras and I will take legal action each time and work out the cost to the city in each case,\" Weil told Le Parisien. \"Everyone needs to work together: city hall, the police and the courts. People have to know that damaging a public building is not nothing.\"\nFrancois Louis, the president of an association of Parisiens who use city hall's official DansMaRue app to signal damage, dumping and antisocial behaviour in public spaces, says he has heard it all before.\nHe said a core group of about 50 \"serial taggers\" were responsible for half of the tags across the city and had been operating with impunity for decades.\n\"Some of these serial taggers are arrested, released and are back tagging again the next day. Some take pictures or film themselves and post on social media. They act with total impunity,\" Louis said.\n\"We need to catch those who do it time and time again. It shouldn't be beyond the capability of the national police to investigate, in fact it's disconcertingly easy. They should be taking images from CCTV, matching it to phone mast records and tracing these serial taggers.\"\nHe added: \"Can you image if Notre Dame was tagged? When the Gilets Jaunes tagged the Arc de Triomphe it was headline news so why are we letting these people vandalise the historic monument at Place de la Republique?\"\nParis police prefecture says the number of tagging cases it has handled increased by 51% in the last two years from 317 to 479. Those taken to court and convicted can face up to two years in prison and fines of up to EUR30,000 for the most serious damage.\nDespite repeated threats of clampdowns, there has been only one prosecution in three years. In 2022, a Paris court sentenced a man known as Six Sax to two months in prison and gave him a EUR17,000 fine.\nCity hall says the cost of repairing the damage falls not only on public authorities but also on private property owners if the graffiti on a building is above the first floor. Officials also worry that the chemicals used are causing permanent damage to the stone of monuments and buildings and the trees.\nEmmanuel Gregoire, a former deputy mayor of Paris who hopes to be elected as city mayor next year, said the authority had been compiling files on the worst serial taggers with a view to producing evidence for any eventual court cases.\n\"These investigators take photographs and look at social networks and AI to identify the signatures,\" he said. \"Many of the taggers are not anonymous but operate under their own names with a sense of impunity.\"\nSitting in a cafe just off Place de la Republique, Gregoire pointed to tags all along the facade of a building opposite. \"They've gone along from balcony to balcony tagging the wall. It's a real problem all over Paris but this is one of the worst-hit areas.\"\nLouis said the ubiquitous tags are a stain on the city's magnificent Hausmannian avenues of the Grands Boulevards.\n\"They're like dogs pissing against a wall to mark their territory,\" he said. \"It gives a very poor impression. People who have a certain image of the city in their mind arrive here and see whole districts trashed by tagging.\"",
      "ml_hf_summary": "In Paris, vandalism targeting historic monuments and buildings has increased significantly, with graffiti tags appearing on landmarks like the Marianne statue, plane trees, apartment buildings, and benches.  The mayor of the central district, Ariel Weil, is taking action to combat this issue, promising legal action against perpetrators and seeking fines for estimated €6 million in damages annually. The city's DansMaRue app has been used by residents to report damage, revealing a core group of serial taggers responsible for a significant portion of the vandalism.  While police have seen a 51% increase in tagging cases over two years, only one person was prosecuted and sentenced in three years.  The city is working on compiling evidence against repeat offenders through photographic analysis and social media monitoring to pursue legal action.  \n"

But they are a chilling indication of the executioners we don't know\nBeing an executioner is not the sort of job that gets posted in a local wanted ad. Kids don't dream about being an executioner when they grow up, and people don't go to school for it. So how does one become a death row executioner in the US, and who are the people doing it?\nThis was the question I couldn't help but ask when I began a book project on lethal injection back in 2018. I'm a death penalty researcher, and I was trying to figure out why states are so breathtakingly bad at a procedure that we use on cats and dogs every day. Part of the riddle was who is performing these executions.\nSeven years later - and with the Trump administration promising more executions to come - I have an answer, sort of.\nWe do not, and for the most part cannot, know precisely who is under the executioner's hood. State secrecy statutes put the equivalent of a Harry Potter cloak of invisibility over these state-sanctioned killers. But litigation files and investigative journalism have revealed a number of executioners' identities, allowing us to peek behind the veil of secrecy for a glimpse of who these people are.\nConsider Missouri's chief executioner from 1995-2006, Dr Alan Doerhoff, who was responsible for 54 of Missouri's 65 executions between 1976 and 2006. He didn't push the syringes - shockingly, non-medical prison guards did that - but he did most everything else. \"Nobody will ever do as many [executions] as I have,\" he would later boast.\nDoerhoff's identity was revealed when a lawyer for a condemned prisoner checked the prison's chemical dispensary logs and discovered that 2.5 grams of sodium thiopental (the drug used to anesthetize the prisoner) had been used in previous executions. The state's protocol called for 5 grams, double that amount. The prisoner sued.\nState officials first told the court that the chemical dispensary logs were wrong. But the next day, they wrote again to \"apologize to the court and the parties for providing incorrect information\". The logs were correct. The amount of sodium thiopental being injected was wrong.\nTroubled by the finding, the court allowed the prisoner's lawyers to conduct a limited deposition of the state's chief executioner. The executioner stated under oath that he had problems mixing the drugs, \"so right now we're still improvising\". He also said that he \"sometimes transpose[d] numbers\".\n\"I am dyslexic,\" he explained. \"So, it's not unusual for me to make mistakes.\" (Doerhoff later stated that he was not dyslexic, he just sometimes mixed up numbers.)\nMissouri doubled down on its executioner, telling the court that it was confident in his competence and planned to continue to use him in future executions. But the court rejected the state's assurances, writing that it was \"gravely concerned that a physician who is solely responsible for correctly mixing the drugs which will be responsible for humanely ending the life of condemned inmates has a condition which causes him confusion with regard to numbers\".\nThe state appealed, but soon thereafter, investigative journalism discovered Doerhoff's identity. Jeremy Kohler with the St Louis Post-Dispatch broke the story in January 2008, and with it came another shocking revelation: Doerhoff had been sued for medical malpractice more than 20 times, and his hospital privileges had been revoked at two hospitals. Doerhoff had also been publicly reprimanded by the state medical board for hiding his malpractice suits from the hospitals where he practiced.\nAll of this was known to the Missouri attorney general's office when it assured the court of Doerhoff's professional competence. After oral arguments, the state dropped its appeal of the ruling.\nThe following year, Missouri's legislature passed a law stating: \"A person may not knowingly disclose the identity of a current or former member of an execution team,\" authorizing punitive damages for violations.\n\"Their answer to the public finding out they had an incompetent doctor was making it impossible to find out who the doctor is,\" an ACLU spokesperson stated.\nNo longer able to serve as Missouri's executioner, Doerhoff joined the staff of a local hair-removal business and served as an executioner for the federal government and at least one other state - Arizona.\nArizona knew about the trial court's ruling in Missouri, and the facts behind it. But it hired Doerhoff anyway, and he conducted an execution for the state in 2007, just months after being barred from conducting executions in Missouri.\nWhen attorneys found out about Doerhoff's involvement, the prisoners next in line for execution in Arizona sued.\nArizona settled that suit in 2009, agreeing to a number of changes in its lethal injection protocol, including formal background and license checks of its executioners. But during the litigation, attorneys for the prisoners discovered that Doerhoff wasn't the only executioner who had no business conducting executions.\nOne of Arizona's three IV team executioners was medical team member #3, who was once a nurse but had his nursing license suspended. At the time of the litigation, his occupation was running an appliance business in another state. The identity of medical team member #3 is unknown, but the court noted that he had been arrested multiple times, \"including three times in 10 days in Arizona for a DUI in 2007\".\nArizona pledged that with its new screening system in place, the court could be confident that the state would use only licensed medical personnel going forward.\nBut in 2011, Arizona was hauled back into federal court because it had not made good on its promise. The prison director admitted to conducting five executions with full knowledge that medical team member #4 did not hold a medical license of any kind. Nor did officials conduct the required criminal history check on him. If they had, they would have learned that medical team member #4 had been charged with DUI in 2008, public intoxication in 2000, and writing a bad check before that.\nMedical team member #4 was a prison guard who had previously served as a medical corpsman in the military. He later stated that his only screening was a phone call from the warden \"asking whether he knew how to start an IV and whether he would have a problem doing it for an execution\". He was not asked any other questions, and at the time, he had not placed an IV for 15 years. On paper, Arizona was dutifully screening its execution team members. But in reality, the state was doing nothing of the sort.\nMissouri and Arizona are not the only states where discoveries about executioners have raised serious questions about the care and competence with which executioners are chosen. In 2006, a federal court struck down California's lethal injection protocol based in part on the \"inconsistent and unreliable screening of execution team members\".\nThe execution team member responsible for the custody of lethal injection drugs had been disciplined for smuggling drugs into San Quentin before joining the execution team; two team members had been arrested for drunk driving; one suffered from depression and PTSD; and one had been out on a two-month medical leave from getting into a fight with a prisoner.\nThe court in California also noted the \"extremely troubling\" disappearance of sodium thiopental that was ostensibly taken from the prison pharmacy for training purposes but never used and never returned. \"These circumstances may warrant investigation by an appropriate law-enforcement agency,\" the court wrote. In California, the state's executioners were also the chief suspects in a potential criminal investigation.\nThe federal government has proven no better than states on this score. Not only did the federal government hire Doerhoff after he was banned from serving as Missouri's executioner, but it also hired a nurse for the Timothy McVeigh execution who had been charged with felony aggravated stalking and first-degree tampering with property, ultimately pleading no contest to the misdemeanor version of both charges. The nurse had allegedly smashed the windshield and headlights of a man who was seeing his estranged wife, ran over his mailbox, smashed windows of his home, and left voice messages threatening to burn his house down and blow his \"[expletive] head off\"!\nFederal officials knew of the convictions when it hired him - the nurse was on active probation and had to get permission from his probation officer to leave the state.\n\"It seems bizarre to me that we would knowingly allow an offender, on active supervision, to participate in the execution process at any level,\" a probation supervisor had written while the department was considering the request. But the permission was granted.\nIn an internal memo, the administrator who confirmed the request for travel wrote: \"It would be extremely problematic for [the nurse] and this department if the media got wind of this.\"\nAnd how did this nurse-executioner get on the federal government's radar? He was recommended by the Missouri department of corrections. A nurse with his own serious criminal convictions was secretly conducting executions on behalf of the show-me state.\nLethal injection litigation has likewise revealed patently unfit executioners in other states as well. In Maryland, litigation revealed that one member of the state's execution team had been fired by a local police department and charged with poisoning several neighborhood dogs, while another execution team member had been suspended for spitting in prisoners' food.\nIn Tennessee, litigation revealed that a member of the execution team had pleaded guilty, twice, to possession of a controlled substance, and missed an execution because he was at an in-patient treatment program. That was in 2007. In 2021, Tennessee's physician-executioner stated that he surrendered his surgery accreditation because of \"too many malpractice suits\" - at least 10 by his estimation.\nThese are just the executioners we know. But they are a chilling indication of the executioners we don't know. As the former head of Oklahoma's corrections department told a legislative committee in 2023, the prison staff charged with carrying out executions are \"some of the lowest-paid state employees in government\".\nIn executions, as elsewhere, you get what you pay for. Even when a doctor is nominally involved in the execution process, the people injecting the drugs are typically low-level prison employees.\nMost executioners say they just fell into the job. The opportunity came to them, and they had their reasons for saying yes. For prison guards, it may be a necessary step to moving up the prison ranks. Doctors likewise tend to say they simply slipped into the role. They had agreed to be an observer, but then the medical team needed help. Who were they to watch executioners prick a prisoner a dozen times in a desperate attempt to pierce the vein when they could do it more quickly?\nOne reason doctors aren't giving, but merits mention anyway, is money. A doctor willing to participate in an execution is a precious commodity, and states will pay dearly for it - up to $20,000 in cash per execution in some places. No doctor yet has said they're participating in executions for the money. But the fact that they can make a killing from state killing has to be worth something.\nCorinna Lain is the author of Secrets of the Killing State: The Untold Story of Lethal Injection, out on 22 April",
      "ml_hf_summary": "This article provides a compelling and disturbing look at the often-questionable selection process for executioners in the United States. Here's a breakdown of the key points and takeaways:\n\n**The Problem:**\n\n* **Lack of Scrutiny & Background Checks:**  Many states lack rigorous background checks or screening processes for executioners, leading to potentially unfit individuals being chosen. \n* **Low Pay & Incentives:** The low pay and potential financial incentives (up to $20,000 per execution) can incentivize participation from unqualified individuals.\n* **Lack of Transparency:**  The selection process is often opaque, making it difficult to assess the competence and suitability of executioners.\n\n**Examples of Unfit Executioners:**\n\n* **Doerhoff Case (Missouri & California):** The article details instances where doctors with serious criminal convictions or history of malpractice were hired for executions despite their questionable qualifications.\n* **Nurse Executioner (Federal Government):**  A nurse convicted of crimes like poisoning dogs and drug possession was hired by the federal government to participate in executions, highlighting a lack of oversight and accountability. \n* **Maryland & Tennessee:** The article mentions other states where executioners have been found unfit for their roles due to past misconduct or criminal convictions.\n\n**The Bigger Picture:**\n\n* **Ethical Concerns:**  The article raises serious ethical concerns about the selection process for executioners, highlighting the potential for human error and the risk of executing innocent people.\n* **Public Safety & Justice:** The article emphasizes that the integrity of the justice system is at stake when unqualified individuals are involved in executions. \n\n**What Can Be Done?**\n\n* **Increased Scrutiny & Background Checks:**  States should implement stricter background checks, including criminal history and mental health records, to ensure only qualified individuals are chosen for executioner roles.\n* **Transparency & Accountability:**  The selection process should be more transparent, with clear guidelines and accountability measures in place. \n* **Higher Pay & Incentives:**  Offering higher pay and incentives for qualified professionals could help attract skilled individuals who prioritize ethical conduct and expertise.\n\n\n**Overall:**\n\nThis article serves as a stark reminder of the need for greater transparency, accountability, and rigorous screening processes when it comes to selecting executioners in the United States. The potential for human error and the risk of executing innocent people are serious concerns that demand immediate attention. \n"

A natural communicator, he is also that rare breed who has clearly lived through much, analysed it thoroughly and internalised what worked for him in such a way that he can share it with others in direct, ordinary and therefore deeply affecting terms, instead of sounding like a therapised robot. He speaks with a wonderful combination of authority and compassion. You can see even the most traumatised patients falling under his spell and beginning to heal almost in real time.\nAnd there is real trauma here. Most notably, perhaps, in Kerry's story. She longs to get rid of a stubborn double chin that persists despite her losing several stone after a lifetime of being overweight. Her size was one of her abusive father's favourite subjects of attack, which left her no respite from the other comments she received at school and in public. \"That's how I felt before I was allowed to become anybody,\" she says. She is now slim and, it is implied, has been in therapy before. But her chin, she explains on the verge of tears, \"is what's left of my dad. I've tried so hard to get rid of his voice.\" Now she wants the physical reminder gone too.\nLove My Face is (ironically) a superficial production. Whatever the actual extent of Jono's discussions with each participant, we are shown very little of it (but enough, as I say, to appreciate his talent for connecting and supporting each one according to their needs). More time is spent with the medics and their proffered plans - all of which are taken up by their subjects, most of whom have been denied further treatment on the NHS because it is \"only\" cosmetic - and on the obligatory reveals after the necessary weeks or months of care. For any deeper meanings or lessons to be learned, the viewer must do his or her own running.\nIt is fascinating, for example, to note the impact on the participants of a characteristic acquired during adolescence, such as Mia's alopecia, and the repeated mentions of becoming self-conscious only as they were tormented at secondary school. It's a painful reminder of how very little you need to deviate from the norm at that time to be marked - by yourself and by those around you - for life. We hear that Hattie was called a \"minger\" and \"ugly\" for her \"Concorde\" nose, and has \"always been shut down ... I feel like I shouldn't be here.\" Kayleigh talks of her \"shame\" about the port wine stain birthmark that covers part of her face, and says she hasn't left the house without makeup since she was first old enough to apply it.\nYou can also wonder at the gulf between people's perceptions of themselves and the reality. There are a couple of times in the series when it is hard to see what is troubling a participant - with even fellow guests struggling - until it is pointed out. It is unclear whether anyone's perspective shifts when they are in the company of people whose differences are far more marked. This also makes you question how much of Jono's magic would be required to undo the harm social intolerance has caused the participants (who, for the most part, are not physically circumscribed in any way by their conditions) so that they can go without the medical interventions on offer.\nThe programme itself, however, is content to end with the big visual reveals and words of gratitude to Jono for helping them find some peace with their experiences. Good enough, I suppose.\n Love My Face is on Channel 4",
      "ml_hf_summary": "\"Love My Face,\" a four-episode series on Channel 4, explores how individuals with facial differences cope with societal pressures and medical options. The program follows patients at a specialized treatment facility who are presented with various medical interventions for their conditions. Jono Lancaster, who has Treacher Collins syndrome, provides emotional support and guidance to the participants, helping them understand and manage their unique challenges.  The series highlights the impact of social stigma on individuals' self-esteem, showcasing personal stories of patients struggling with physical differences and societal prejudice. The program focuses on the medical interventions offered and the subsequent reveals of the patients' progress after undergoing treatment. \n"

      "content": "To celebrate the Oscar-winning actor's birthday this week, we look back at the highlights of a six-decade career, from early classics such as Doctor Zhivago and Billy Liar to later roles in Finding Neverland and Away From Her.\nThere are many things wrong with Kenneth Branagh's galumphing slab of actor-manager Shakespeare, but Christie as Gertrude is not one of them. Her casting might have been conducive to the Oedipal side of the Danish prince's feelings towards his mother - if only the director's bombastic performance had allowed room for it.\nA mostly non-Irish cast goes full begorra in this Sean O'Casey biopic, with Christie in a brief but eye-catching turn as a sex worker called Daisy Battles. Jack Cardiff took over directing duties when John Ford fell ill; the results are rambling, but the anti-British riot scenes are ace.\nIrish accents again, as Christie reunites with her Don't Look Now co-star Donald Sutherland in 1980s Donegal, playing the widow Helen Cuffe, whose husband was accidentally murdered by the IRA. The pair's old chemistry is still there, and the landscape is splendid. But, alas, when it comes to the men in her life, this unfortunate woman has the worst luck ever.\nThree nicely calibrated female performances keep this tasteful adaptation of Rebecca West's 1918 novel afloat. Christie plays a narrow-minded snob who is outraged when her husband (Alan Bates) returns traumatised from the first world war and fails to recognise her, but reconnects instead with a working-class sweetheart (Glenda Jackson) from his youth; Ann-Margret is wonderful as a compassionate cousin.\nThis is must for anyone studying English literature, though Christie's wilful heroine, all fringe and mascara, smacks more of swinging 60s London than of Thomas Hardy's Wessex; Terence Stamp, Christie's former off-screen boyfriend, sports a Sgt Pepper moustache as Sgt Troy. The best bit is when Alan Bates's sheep fall off a cliff.\nJohn Schlesinger's film about the rise of a good-looking but shallow playgirl epitomises all that was good-looking but shallow about the British new wave. Christie won an Oscar for looking fabulous; Frederic Raphael's misogynistic screenplay also won an Oscar, but now feels suspiciously like a petty act of revenge on some unknown woman who was once mean to him.\nThe romance between Omar Sharif as Zhivago and Christie as Lara is the least convincing thing about David Lean's spectacular epic, set against the backdrop of the Russian Revolution, but shot in sunny Spain. Once again, anachronistic hair and makeup make Christie look more like a Chelsea socialite than a Slavic muse, but it was the box office double whammy of this and Darling, in the same year, that cemented her status as an international star.\nThe third of Christie's collaborations with Warren Beatty is a breezy remake of Here Comes Mr Jordan (1941), with Beatty co-directing himself as a Los Angeles quarterback temporarily returned to Earth in the body of a murdered industrialist. Christie plays the earnest eco-activist who wins his heart.\nRuth Prawer Jhabvala adapted her own Booker-winning novel for the Merchant Ivory team's first big success, part of a 1980s British fad for all things Raj. Christie (born in Assam, north-eastern India) plays an English woman visiting India, but her exploits in the present day are less compelling than the flashbacks to her great-aunt (Greta Scacchi) in the 1920s.\nCritics were aghast at the idea of an A-list actor playing a woman forcibly impregnated by a computer in a genre film they considered \"silly\". But Donald Cammell's sci-fi thriller couldn't be more pertinent to 2025, with its themes of domestic abuse and overreaching AI. Christie - rightly - gives it her all.\nChristie plays the disapproving mother of widowed Kate Winslet, whose sons inspire JM Barrie (Johnny Depp) to write Peter Pan in this weepie biopic. It's not mentioned here, of course, but Christie's character, who mellows as the film goes on, will soon be grandmother to Daphne du Maurier, who wrote Don't Look Now.\nTwo couples in Montreal swap partners in Alan Rudolph's stilted sex comedy. Whenever Christie is working her magic on screen as the unhappy wife of handyman Nick Nolte, she makes you forget the contrived situations and clunky dialogue, and sweeps you up into a sublime, deservedly Oscar-nominated performance.\nA 12-year-old boy, spending the summer at a school friend's country house, is cajoled into carrying secret messages between his chum's older sister (Christie) and a tenant farmer (Alan Bates). After looking distractingly modern in other lit-flicks such as Doctor Zhivago, Christie is perfectly credible as an Edwardian aristocrat in Joseph Losey's quietly devastating film adaptation of LP Hartley's novel, scripted by Harold Pinter.\nSarah Polley's directing debut, adapted from a story by Alice Munro, gives Christie the best late role of her career, as a married woman showing symptoms of Alzheimer's disease. She checks into a nursing home, but her husband wonders if she's exaggerating her memory loss as revenge for his past infidelities. Ambiguous to the end, Christie makes it about more than just dementia, and earned a fourth Oscar nomination.\nIn the real-life ex-couple's second film together, Beatty plays a philandering Beverly Hills hairdresser who still carries a torch for his former girlfriend. Hal Ashby's satire, set on the eve of Nixon's 1968 election victory, now seems more sad than funny, but Christie, rocking a backless black sequined Jean Varon gown, is a hoot as she drunkenly tries to fellate her ex at a posh dinner party.\nThe current American trend of banning books makes Francois Truffaut's charmingly retro-futurist film of Ray Bradbury's novel feel like a wake-up call. Oskar Werner is a colourless leading man, but Christie makes up for it in her dual roles as his hilariously conformist wife and a rebellious neighbour who asks: \"Do you ever read the books you burn?\"\nJohn Schlesinger's film of Keith Waterhouse's novel leavens its social realism (shot on the streets of Bradford!) with the fantasies of Billy (Tom Courtenay). In her breakthrough performance, Christie radiates liberation and natural glamour, but miraculously makes Liz not just a dream girl but a fully realised character. She's the girl next door - if the girl next door were a stunner.\nChristie dials up the kooky as an unhappily married woman who attaches herself to a San Francisco surgeon played by George C Scott. The drama starts off frothy but becomes progressively downbeat, until you belatedly realise you're watching a tragedy, nudged along by nonlinear inserts now considered more typical of the film's cinematographer, Nicolas Roeg (and editor Antony Gibbs), than its director, Richard Lester.\nNonlinear inserts abound in Roeg's haunting kaleidoscope of a chiller that is also a heartbreaking portrait of a marriage under stress. Christie and Sutherland play bereaved parents who relocate to Venice, where a blind clairvoyant claims to be in contact with their dead daughter. The wife accepts what she can't see, while the husband's scepticism blinds him to the truth until it's too late.\nChristie came up with most of her own dialogue as the cockney brothel-keeper in Robert Altman's melancholy revisionist western, set in a muddy mining town. Whether she's tucking into fried eggs, striving to keep her relationship with McCabe (Beatty) on a business footing, or drifting away in an opium daze, this is peak Christie, and one of the funniest, saddest love stories ever filmed.",

      "content": "Why is the great performance artist making pianist Levit play a Satie piece 840 times? And does he really have a screen to go behind should nature call? We enter another level of time and consciousness\nAmid the experiments and cross-genre collaborations in this year's Multitudes festival is one event that will challenge its performer as much as its audience - and the only one where specially appointed brow-moppers will be on hand. At 10am on 24 April in London's Queen Elizabeth Hall, pianist Igor Levit will begin a performance of a single piece, Erik Satie's Vexations, in a concert that will last at least 16 hours.\nA few tickets (for the full duration or one-hour slots) are still available for this extreme pianist endurance event. What should the audience expect to get out of it? \"I'd never tell an audience what they should experience,\" says Levit. \"But I would encourage people to just literally let it go. There is no agenda in this piece. There is no meaning to it. It's just empty space, so just dive into that and let go. That would be the dream.\"\nIn May 2020, Levit found in the Covid lockdown, and the series of solo concerts he livestreamed from his Berlin apartment, an excuse to fulfil his dream of tackling this pianistic challenge. His first performance of Vexations was streamed from an empty room; it lasted 15 hours and 29 minutes.\nSatie's slight piece, a simple phrase that alone is perhaps 1-2 minutes long, was written in 1893 for keyboard (Satie didn't specify the exact instrument). The manuscript included the composer's note to potential performers: \"In order to play this motif 840 times in a row, it would be advisable to prepare oneself beforehand, in the deepest silence, through serious immobilities.\"\nThere's no evidence that Satie intended the piece to be performed in this manner, but over the years, artists such as John Cage have organised marathons at which the feat of repeating the piece 840 times has been accomplished by a succession of different pianists. It has rarely been played in its entirety by the same person, and never before live in the UK.\nDuring his 2020 meditations, Levit says he kept returning to the work of his friend, the Serbian performance artist Marina Abramovic. \"I thought, this is the musical embodiment of what Marina has been doing all these years,\" he says, citing her method of counting individual grains of rice over hours to experience the benefits of self-discipline and mindfulness. \"You have this weird piece, a minute and a half long, which doesn't make any sense, which is neither beautiful or not, it's just there. And Satie didn't even say 'play it 840 times'; all he says is 'in order to do so, you should do X, Y and Z'. I thought Marina would love that.\"\nHe started talking to Abramovic about the piece about two years ago, and the resulting collaboration has its world premiere next week, when the 38-year-old Russian-German pianist will perform Vexations in full without leaving the stage - and this time in front of an actual audience.\nLevit calls it \"chapter two\" in his artistic collaboration with Abramovic. The pair first blended their talents in 2015, for a production of the Goldberg Variations at the Park Avenue Armory in New York, an idea they hatched in London over an evening of Slavic soup and jokes. For this event the audience were prepared by having their mobile phones locked away and sitting in silence for 30 minutes as the piano slowly glided around and down the onstage runway.\nThe duo's affection and mutual respect is evident as we speak on a video call. Levit, in Berlin, is munching on peanuts. Abramovic, in New York, emerges on screen and scolds her \"genius boy\".\n\"You shouldn't eat peanuts because they can collect mould,\" she says crossly.\n\"Since when do I listen to you?\" he retorts, and so their playful banter continues.\nNo one except Abramovic, who has been plotting the QEH show these past months at her New York studio, knows quite what to expect from it. The performance, she explains, will shape and shift over the hours. The podium on which the piano sits is detachable and its different parts will fragment, like the pieces of a puzzle. \"We are creating some kind of sculptural element on the stage,\" she says. Renowned lighting designer Urs Schonebaum is working with her to create mirror-like effects. The set will reflect back on itself, she explains. \"Everything you see down, you can see up.\"\nThe audience will be steeped in the Abramovic method (the idea of using meditative repetition to enhance one's consciousness, applied this time to classical music). The Southbank Centre has warned of \"adult content\", though Abramovic insists this has nothing to do with her plans, and is likely \"British over-caution\", based on her previous, often risque exploits.\nEven Levit seems unaware of what she has in store. \"I cannot say what will happen, except you can expect me to be there and start playing,\" he says. \"Maybe it's going to be dreadful. Maybe I will realise that I can only do it alone. And maybe it's going to be the most fantastic thing ever. Who knows?\"\nAnd what if he needs to pee?\n\"I have a screen which goes up around the area of the piano,\" says Abramovic. \"And his seat can turn into a bed, so that he can lie next to the piano for 10 or 15 minutes if he needs to. There will be two assistants, one each side of the stage, who can wipe his brow or bring him food and drink. If they get any sign from him that he needs anything, they'll be there. But Igor will never leave the stage, ever,\" she says firmly.\nShe describes the performance as a study in being in the present. \"If you start talking about how much time has passed, and how much time is in the future, you've lost the concept. Igor has to be there now, in the space where there is no time, and the public has to go into that space. It is the same thing that happens when you count rice.\n\"You're going to go completely to another level of time, consciousness and experience.\" Will she be on stage? \"I'm introducing the piece, and then I'll be in the public, but I will not be babysitting him.\"\nBorn in the Russian city of Gorki in 1987, Levit grew up in Hanover, northern Germany. His intensity and doughtiness as a performer and as an often outspoken political campaigner have earned him global acclaim and respect, but he has pulled back from social media in recent years after death threats and many antisemitic attacks. He says he's no less passionate about the issues that move him (refugees, Ukraine, Israel) but feels the necessity to concentrate on piano playing.\n\"The darker the world gets, the more I'd like to be the pianist that I am, and the more art we should create, the more music we should make. It is literally a tool of mental and emotional survival. For me, at least, I can say it becomes more and more existential.\"\n\"In my world, which is pushing down keys in black and white, creating sound, creating noise, playing melodies and sharing this with other people, there is no war, no cynicism, no power games - at least not in a bad way. There is, in the best case, transcendence, so there's a reason to live in my world, and I would like to share this.\"\nAbramovic agrees. \"If you spend your time looking at television, listening to the news, this horrible, ugly face of Donald Trump all the time, [or with] the diarrhoea of social media, you're really lost. You have to create your own sense of peace in yourself.\"\nBut why is Levit prepared to put himself through such a potentially gruelling experience for a piece of music that he admits it is hard to be passionate about? \"It's not about reaching a goal. I've never cared for goals. I am a process person,\" he says. \"And so my answer, from the bottom of my heart, is because I can, and because I want to, and because I need it. I have the chance to do it with this beautiful lady, and we have been given the space. The main answer is just because. Full stop. That's it.\"\n Vexations is at Queen Elizabeth Hall, London on 24-25 April",
      "ml_hf_summary": "Igor Levit will perform Erik Satie's \"Vexations\" for at least 16 hours in a concert at London's Queen Elizabeth Hall on April 24th and 25th. The performance is part of the Multitudes festival, where Levit will play the piece continuously without leaving the stage.  The piece consists of repeating a single phrase from Satie's work for 840 times, with no specific goal or pre-determined outcome.  Abramović, who is collaborating with Levit on this performance, has designed a set that includes a detachable piano platform and mirrors to create an immersive experience for the audience. The event will explore themes of time, consciousness, and personal survival through music. \n"

Instrumental lines seem to grieve alongside the singers or wrap themselves round the voices in consolation.\nA Tenebrae service takes place in gathering darkness as candles are extinguished one by one, and minimal lighting was used for the concert, which gave the music in an unbroken sequence with little to distract from the devotional mood. Credited as directing from the organ, Christie might better be described as the effective anchor of what to all intents and purposes was a chamber ensemble of equals, playing with superb focus, great refinement and real depth of feeling.\nThe singers were tenor Ilja Aksionov and bass-baritone Padraic Rowan, both immaculate. Aksionov with his slightly reedy tone, admirable liquidity and subtle dynamic control, sounded quietly intense in the Seconde Lecon de Tenebres du Mercredi Saint, while Rowan proved vividly dramatic in the Troisieme Lecon de Tenebres du Mercredi Saint and attained remarkable depths of fervour in the Responsory Tenebrae Factae Sunt. Their voices blended wonderfully, meanwhile, in the Troisieme Leconde Tenebres du Vendredi Saint and in the closing Responsorium Tristis Est Anima Mea, among the most beautiful things Charpentier ever wrote, with its chromatic harmonies and exquisitely entwining vocal lines.

      "content": "The star's insistence on jumping from a 2,722ft skyscraper to up the action ante for Thunderbolts may not be quite enough to save Marvel's latest. But her career should fly\nIf you ever needed definitive proof that Marvel has lost pace with the zeitgeist, just look at the panicky marketing of Thunderbolts . The film opens in a couple of weeks and, according to the trade press, is tracking to open soft.\nHad this been six or seven years ago, then fans would be clamouring to see Thunderbolts simply because it was the latest instalment of the grand MCU soap opera. After all, it's a film that stars several side characters from older Marvel films and TV shows, and there was a time when audiences would go bananas for this sort of thing. But as the last few MCU films have shown, that approach doesn't really work any more.\nFor a while Marvel attempted to trade on the intrigue of the asterisk, but that fell down because the people who cared guessed what it meant and the people who didn't couldn't care less. Then came the weird trailer last month where the movie tried to rebrand itself as an A24 film, declaring itself to be \"absolute cinema\" because it hired the production designer from Hereditary and the editor of Minari (and, in Julia Louis-Dreyfus, the star of You Hurt My Feelings). And while there was a lot of novelty about this - when was the last time a Marvel film made a big deal about the pedigree of the people who made it? - it didn't do a lot to shift the needle.\nBut now, finally, it looks as if Marvel has cracked it. The final flurry of pre-release marketing about Thunderbolts doesn't make a big deal about the superheroes or the mythology or the cinematography or anything like that. No, this time it's being much smarter. This time it's unveiling Florence Pugh as the new Tom Cruise.\nThunderbolts contains a big setpiece stunt in which Florence Pugh jumps off the 2,722ft Merdeka 118 in Kuala Lumpur, the second tallest skyscraper on Earth. Now it has been revealed that not only did Pugh perform the stunt herself, but she also pleaded with the Marvel brass to do it.\n\"As we got closer and closer to shooting, they said they don't think it's going to happen because it's a crazy insurance ordeal,\" Pugh told Variety. \"I was like what the fuck? Of course we are! We have to do that.\" Referring to herself as a \"sassy Karen\" for refusing to let the issue drop, she then described the moment they relented. \"They're like, 'OK, if you want to fall off the second tallest building, we'll figure it out for you.'\"\nThese claims are backed up by a film that was posted to YouTube five days ago, in which we see Pugh jump off the aforementioned building. In truth, as far as the footage shows, it's less of a jump and more of a dangle - she appears to step off the roof and descend a small distance before she's winched back up - but nevertheless it looks absolutely terrifying.\nIt's a very Mission: Impossiblish formula. You'll remember that the entire selling point of 2023's Dead Reckoning: Part One was the sight of Tom Cruise riding a motorbike off the side of a mountain. Indeed, by the time the film came out we'd already seen the stunt in its various forms hundreds of times.\nOf course, it turns out sharing your biggest stunt ahead of time is not always completely wise. Box office grosses for Dead Reckoning were lower than expected because we'd been given the exciting bit for free several years before it was released. This year's instalment, The Final Reckoning, is doing a better job of hinting at the big stunt - Tom Cruise flapping about on the underside of a corkscrewing biplane - without revealing the whole thing.\nTime will tell whether Thunderbolts should have been less generous with the stunt footage. But for now that doesn't really matter. What matters is that Florence Pugh wants to do her own stunts, and she's fearless about it. If there's a Thunderbolts* 2, maybe she'll do a helmets-off motorbike chase, or a one-take skydive. Maybe she'll beat Cruise and literally shoot into space. Maybe she'll even start sending cakes to people for Christmas. Either way, this might be the start of an amazing action career.",
      "ml_hf_summary": "Marvel's \"Thunderbolts\" film is facing a soft opening due to changing audience preferences and a lackluster marketing strategy. The film stars Florence Pugh as a new Tom Cruise-like figure, who insisted on performing her own stunt jump from the Merdeka 118 skyscraper in Kuala Lumpur.  Pugh's commitment to real stunts was key to generating buzz for the film, which has been heavily promoted through videos and behind-the-scenes footage of the stunt. The film is expected to be released in a couple of weeks. While the marketing strategy may have backfired with some audiences expecting more from the film, it highlights Pugh's dedication to action and her potential as a leading action star. \n"

As one myself, I could be among the targets.\nAll of this is also a cynical political ploy to distract Hungarians from a deepening domestic crisis. With high inflation, a crumbling healthcare system and ailing railways, Orban needs enemies more than ever. Hungary is acutely vulnerable to the collapse of global trade, which his ally in the White House has single-handedly brought about. The electoral system is seen as rigged, but elections are still scheduled for next spring - and Orban's party, Fidesz, is sliding in the polls.\nIncreasingly troubled at home, Orban is looking abroad. In February he declared that the political climate in the west had become more favourable. The implication was clear: with Donald Trump back in power, the EU distracted and global authoritarianism on the rise, there are even fewer consequences facing a leader who wants to dismantle democracy.\nThis has long been much more than a Hungarian story. It is a European crisis - and a warning to every democracy. Take the case of Budapest Pride. For 30 years, Pride has been the largest recurring demonstration of human rights in Hungary - a vital expression of joy, resistance and visibility in the face of growing hostility. It has endured far-right attacks, harassment and vilification. But this year the march has in effect been banned. Organisers and participants have been threatened with facial recognition surveillance and fines of 200,000 Hungarian forints (PS420).\nBudapest Pride is no longer just a march. It is a frontline. A ban on Pride is unprecedented in the EU. It is a rupture with the most basic rights enshrined in Article 2 of the EU treaties: freedom of assembly, freedom from discrimination, the right to live and love without fear.\nAnd yet the European Commission - the guardian of those very treaties - has so far offered nothing but the usual statements of concern. This sets a devastating precedent. It tells every member state that fundamental rights are optional - that governments can outlaw protest and strip people of EU citizenship without consequence.\nLet's be honest: the EU's track record for enforcing the rule of law gives Orban every reason to believe he can get away with it. Years of delay and half-measures have allowed him to tighten his grip with little resistance. While some EU funds have been suspended, most continue flowing. Article 7 proceedings - meant to sanction breaches of EU values - have stalled. There are no meaningful attempts to put them on the agenda, even though suspending Orban's voting rights could shield EU values and end his sabotaging of unanimous EU votes in support of Ukraine.\nThe European Commission and council remain hesitant, divided and timid. This is not just a moral failure - it is a strategic one. The EU may be the last functioning democratic project of global scale. And it is being tested. As democratic backsliding accelerates worldwide, Europe faces a simple question: can it defend its own values? Or will it fold? Because the truth is, an authoritarian turn can happen anywhere. If Pride can be banned in Budapest, it can be banned in Bratislava, Zagreb, Rome. If citizenship becomes a weapon here, it becomes a precedent everywhere.\nSo what should the EU do? Orban is daring Brussels to look away. A European Commission that takes its role seriously would act immediately. It has the legal tools - what's missing is the political courage.\nBrussels is reportedly considering legal action \"if necessary\", but it has yet to take interim steps to protect this year's march, now just two months away. Its usual excuse - the need to avoid \"political interference\" - is no longer viable. Orban is the one breaking the law - the one wiping his feet on the EU treaties.\nThere is also a tangible, immediate way to show solidarity: elected leaders from across Europe should publicly announce that they are joining us at Budapest Pride. We are immensely proud to already have pledges from members of the European parliament. Their presence is not symbolic - it is protective. They help guarantee that the march can take place in safety. When government power is being used to intimidate and suppress, a visible international presence can deter harassment and police overreach. This is not optics - it's a line of defence.\nThis is not a political dispute between equals. This is one side dismantling rights, and the other asking Europe to uphold its own laws. Brussels' engagement would not be a partisan act; it would be a defence of the very values it was created to protect.\nIf we don't respond collectively, publicly and decisively, we will wake up to find the authoritarian turn complete. But we refuse to give up. The party I represent, Momentum, is constantly on the streets, protesting, organising, standing with those who will not be silenced. On 28 June, Budapest Pride will march. Orban says he will stop it. We say, just try.\nTo every democratic leader, activist and ally in Europe: join us. March with us. Let us show together that the streets of a European capital will not surrender to fear.\nKatalin Cseh is a member of the Hungarian national assembly for the Momentum Movement and a former MEP\nDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

      "content": "Allegations of criminality have always been deployed to justify state violence but even 'imperfect' victims deserve basic rights\nLast month, the Trump administration flew 238 Venezuelan immigrants to a brutal prison in El Salvador. Federal officials alleged that the detainees were members of the Tren de Aragua gang, calling them \"heinous monsters\" ,\"criminal aliens\", \"the worst of the worst\". The federal government has also revoked visas for a thousand international students over their alleged participation in protests against Israel's genocide in Palestine. Some were abducted, like Mahmoud Khalil, who has spent more than a month incarcerated in one of the worst jails in the US. Officials alleged that Mahmoud \"sided with terrorists ... who have killed innocent men, women, and children\".\nMedia reports quickly revealed that the Trump administration is lying about \"innocent\" people to justify abducting them. But this raises a more important question: if Trump's victims weren't \"innocent\", does that make them disposable? I worry that emphasizing the innocence of victims creates a rhetorical trap. It's like carefully digging a pit that the fascists can shove us into.\nInstead, we should interrogate the fact that the Trump administration chose to target \"gang members\" and \"terrorist supporters\" in the first step of its ethnic cleansing project. Criminals and terrorists are the bogeymen animating bipartisan racism against Black, Latino and Arab people, and Trump is weaponizing these myths because many liberals have already written them off as less than human. The political context that enabled US residents to be shipped to El Salvador's Cecot facility is a bipartisan project more than 50 years in the making, largely unquestioned by people who are rightfully horrified by recent escalations.\nAllegations of criminality have long been an effective pretext for anti-Black violence in the US - this is the \"war on crime\". So long as there are \"criminals\" to fight, vicious police brutality becomes politically palatable. This is true in blue and red states alike. The gang member is the latest symbol used to dehumanize Black and Latino people, replacing the \"superpredator\". In practice, police and prosecutors invoke the specter of monstrous gangs to continue targeting entire neighborhoods while evading allegations of explicit discrimination.\nYou can be added to a gang database because of your tattoos, the color of the clothing you wear or even for using certain emojis on social media. These lists are riddled with errors, sometimes naming toddlers and elders. More commonly, gang databases index the thousands of people - often children - swept up by police because of where they live or whom they socialize with. The consequences of gang policing are devastating: it can lead to federal prosecution or potential deportation, not to mention a lifetime of state harassment.\nGang membership isn't the only tool the Trump administration can use to portray its victims as guilty. When the \"war on crime\" morphed into the \"war on terror\", Arab and Muslim residents suffered from discriminatory surveillance and repression - the \"terrorist\" category matches the \"gang member\" category in that it justifies racist dragnet policing practices. The \"counter-terrorism\" net has already widened, targeting Stop Cop City activists in Atlanta. This problem is not limited to Republicans - liberal politicians and university stakeholders laid the groundwork for Trump's deportation efforts. Last year, the Anti-Defamation League's CEO, Jonathan Greenblatt, called student Palestine activists proxies for Iran, and New York City's mayor, Eric Adams, smeared us as terrorist supporters to justify an incredibly violent police raid.\nThe widening net of who is considered a criminal not only chills dissent among immigrants and activists. It further dehumanizes and renders disposable people who have genuinely committed harm.\nWe must defend the rights of people who do have criminal records. No one deserves to be whisked away to a brutal prison that deprives them of basic human rights - no matter if it's in El Salvador, Louisiana, California, Pennsylvania or New York. Criminal records and bona fide gang membership don't turn human beings into monsters. If Trump goes through with his plan of sending citizens to El Salvador, he could initially target people convicted of heinous crimes. This would allow federal officials to ask: \"Why do liberals care about pedophiles and murderers?\"\nWe should be prepared to defend the basic rights of all of Trump's targets with our full strength. If a single person becomes disposable, anyone could become the next target. Last week, Trump said he \"loved\" the idea of sending American \"criminals\" to El Salvador, and law professors are sounding the alarm about citizen student activists being subjected to terrorism prosecutions. First it will be the \"migrant gang member\" or \"terrorist on a student visa\" sent to Cecot. Next it will be the domestic gang member and the terrorist-supporting citizen. Eventually, perhaps any political opponent could be construed as a criminal-terrorist.\nTrump may not even need to rely on the justice department to criminalize his enemies - dozens of local cops joined the 6 January 2021 putsch at the US Capitol, and local prosecutors have eagerly charged student activists with felonies. This is another reason to avoid the innocence trap: many police love Trump, and law enforcement can very easily make their adversaries seem like criminals.\nThe innocence trap is dangerous because allegations of criminality have always been deployed to justify state violence. If we only defend the \"innocent\", the fascists will argue that their victim \"was no angel\". An anti-fascist rhetoric that carves out exceptions for imperfect victims is a gift to our opponents.\nJonathan Ben-Menachem is a PhD candidate in sociology at Columbia University, where he researches the politics of criminalization",
      "ml_hf_summary": "In August 2023, the Trump administration deported 238 Venezuelan immigrants to El Salvador's Cecot prison facility, alleging they were members of the Tren de Aragua gang. This action was based on claims that these individuals were \"heinous monsters\" and \"the worst of the worst,\" despite evidence suggesting otherwise. The administration also revoked visas for a thousand international students accused of supporting Palestinian protests against Israel's actions. These deportations, along with past instances of targeting Black, Latino, and Arab communities, highlight how allegations of criminality are often used to justify state violence and dehumanize specific groups.  The article argues that focusing on the \"innocence\" of victims can create a rhetorical trap for fascists who seek to exploit such narratives for their own political gain. \n"

      "content": "If Starmer is serious about bringing young people into his 'social contract', then protecting them from the tech giants must be his priority\nI remember being 16 in the 1960s. The prime minister seemed geriatric and I was sure he should be in care, while a group of us went to meet our young MP, a certain Margaret Thatcher. She was young, but she didn't seem as if she was with the times. We could not dream of voting for someone like her. Matter closed.\nSixteen-year-olds are great fun but they are not grown up. They cannot marry in England and Wales, drive, smoke, get a tattoo or buy alcohol on their own. They are legally classed as children and are supposed to be in formal education or training to 18. Sixteen-year-olds have not taken to the streets demanding the right to the franchise, like the Chartists or suffragettes did.\nSo why has Keir Starmer suddenly reiterated that he intends to enfranchise them to vote in UK-wide elections? The only plausible answer is that he hopes they will vote for him. In a desperate attempt to justify this manoeuvre, he says that, if 16-year-old soldiers \"are old enough to take a bullet for our country\", they should get the vote. (Likewise if they are \"old enough to work\" and \"pay taxes\".)\nIn fact, 16-year-olds are not old enough to \"take a bullet\", since frontline army service is banned for under-18s. Meanwhile, precious few 16-year-olds work, since Starmer's own party, when last in power, made it supposedly compulsory for them to remain in education or training to 18. As for taxes, younger children already pay VAT when they spend their pocket money. The whole argument is slapdash.\nEven the expected electoral gain to Labour is dubious. Well under half of 18-24s turned out at the last general election. There is some evidence from Scotland, which lowered the voting age to 16 in 2014 for the independence referendum and in 2016 for Scottish parliamentary elections, that the new group would be active, though novelty may recently have been a factor in turnout. In Wales, which lowered the voting age to 16 in 2021 for Senedd and local government elections, early evidence suggests that the new group plans to vote at a similarly low rate to other age groups under 55. Either way, Starmer would be lucky to see more than half of his 1.5 million new voters actually turning out, with perhaps about a third of those voting for him. Even then, the general assumption that the young are leftwing has taken a bruising recently from rightwing influencers.\nWhere Starmer must be right is in wanting to bring young people into what he pompously calls his \"social contract\" with gen Z. Here, his absolute priority should not be the ballot box, but how he proposes to prepare the new cohort for their responsibilities. With social media so clearly dominant over the views and behaviour of those whose support he seeks, its proper regulation should be a priority for any such reform.\nThe present government shows no interest in such regulation. Indeed, if anything, quite the reverse. Rumour has it that Starmer, in his attempt to reduce tariffs, is on the brink of pledging no further curbs on the tech giants, in view of their closeness to Donald Trump. This would follow the cabinet's apparent capitulation to those same giants in the matter of copyright and artificial intelligence. All this suggests a complete lack of concern for what must currently be the greatest threat to the mental health of gen Z. All Starmer has done is boast that he watched Adolescence. So what now: voting at 13?\nThe one thing that might excuse the government's cynicism is a programme to prepare teenagers for their new responsibility. The tyranny of academic GCSEs and exam culture should be suspended, if not for ever, then at least for one day a week, to be replaced by compulsory civic awareness. This should embrace an introduction to peace and war, national politics, local government, the law, practical economics and the handling of money.\nThe subservience of British secondary education to academia was dented only as recently as 2000. The then Labour government nodded at the revolutionary idea that schools might help pupils to get on in life, rather than merely get a place at university. It introduced \"non-compulsory\" personal, social and health education, to which economics was later added. To say these topics do not rank highly in the syllabus would be an understatement, nor do they embrace politics.\nI know teachers who genuinely think it is not their job to \"teach\" a world outside education. They see no need to educate young people in how to relate to one another, work in groups or keep their minds and bodies in good shape. They see no reason to teach self-presentation or expression, the new skills of oracy so crucial to getting on in a creative career. Teachers seem to think all this is for parents, not schools, even when they know it is not true. The school curriculum is in the dark ages.\nThe truth of the matter is that teenagers are acquiring these skills and attitudes from social media. It is online that they are gaining a whole new context for their personal and social lives. They are doing so from the worst possible sources: biased, uncensored, unmediated and unregulated. It must be the worst preparation for that most sacred of democratic rituals - the vote. This is the grim reality of Starmer's new social contract.\nSimon Jenkins is a Guardian columnist",
      "ml_hf_summary": "Keir Starmer has proposed enfranchising 16-year-olds in UK-wide elections, citing their potential to vote for him as justification. However, this proposal faces skepticism due to the lack of evidence suggesting significant electoral gains and concerns about its impact on young people's readiness for civic responsibility.  The author argues that Starmer should prioritize preparing young people for their responsibilities rather than focusing solely on enfranchisement. This includes promoting civic awareness through a curriculum focused on topics like peace, war, politics, economics, and money management. The article criticizes the current education system for neglecting these crucial skills and emphasizes the need to address the negative influence of unregulated social media on young people's development.  The author concludes that Starmer's proposed \"social contract\" with Gen Z is flawed due to its focus on voting at 16 without addressing the underlying issues of civic engagement and responsible digital citizenship. \n"

      "content": "The president's penchant for the gaudy has been mocked but the menace beneath was clear when he met El Salvador's leader\nThe Oval Office meeting of Donald Trump and Nayib Bukele on Monday was a grotesque spectacle. Both men, elected to lead nominally democratic countries, have described themselves as dictators, and they exuded that sense of smug impunity. While reporters sought answers on the fate of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a 29-year-old father of three who was wrongly deported to El Salvador's notorious Cecot mega-prison, Trump and Bukele disclaimed responsibility, joked about further deportations, and engaged in casual slander of Abrego Garcia, who is not, and has never been alleged to be, a terrorist.\nAnd then there was the gold. So much gold.\nSince returning to the White House, Trump has applied gilt to the Oval Office with the same light touch that he brings to the caps lock key, which is to say, it's everywhere. Gold knickknacks cover every surface in the Oval Office while gold-framed paintings climb the walls. Trump has added gold highlighting to the room's ornamental moulding, imported gold cherubs from Mar-a-Lago, crowded the mantelpiece with gold urns, and even affixed what I can only describe as gold filigree doodads to the walls and fireplace. (These ornaments were made by John Icart, a south Florida cabinetmaker, according to the Wall Street Journal, though it's possible to find a close replica on Alibaba for $1-5 a pop, pre-tariff.) He even has a gold seal on the button on his desk he presses to summon an aide with a Diet Coke.\nTrump's penchant for the gaudy has long drawn jeers - the Washington Post critic-at-large Robin Givhan wrote that the redecorated Oval Office \"now evokes insecurity and petulance\" - but as with so many of Trump's buffoonish tendencies, there is a real menace beneath the shiny surface.\nThose tacky antique decorative urns were gilded using ormolu, according to Givhan, a technique involving mercury that was so toxic that its practitioners rarely lived past 40. And while ormolu was banned by the French government in 1830, gold mining remains a major source of pollution, accounting for 38% of global anthropogenic mercury emissions, as well as copious amounts of cyanide and arsenic, with serious consequences for human and environmental health. Scientists estimate that more than 100 million people worldwide suffer chronic mercury poisoning, either because they are themselves miners or they live in a community affected by mining.\nThat's no secret to the people of El Salvador, who made history in 2017 by becoming the first country in the world to ban the mining of metals. The ban followed years of campaigning by environmental and Indigenous activists fighting back against the international companies that have for so long extracted mineral wealth from Latin America while leaving little behind but polluted waterways and impoverished communities. The European appetite for the western hemisphere's precious metals fueled centuries of slaughter of Indigenous populations and enormous environmental destruction; great wealth was extracted, but rarely was it shared with the local communities.\nBukele rose to power in El Salvador in 2019 with promises of an entirely different kind of mining - of cryptocurrency, rather than metals. But the 2023 prosecution of five key activists behind the mining ban on decades-old, trumped-up charges led to suspicions, since confirmed, that he was planning to reverse course.\nIn late 2024, Bukele came out against the ban, claiming that El Salvador had untapped gold reserves worth $3tn. The self-proclaimed \"world's coolest dictator\" soon had his wish made manifest by a compliant congress, and El Salvador's historic ban is no more. While Bukele claims that future gold mining will be mercury-free and \"sustainable\", environmental activists are getting ready to fight to save El Salvador's waterways.\nWhether that $3tn of gold will ever materialize is very much in question. Open pit mining involves the production of just over four metric tons of waste, much of which is toxic, to find a single gram of gold, according to Stephen Lezak, a researcher at the University of Oxford and author of a recent paper, The Case Against Gold Mining.\n\"If you run any kind of holistic cost-benefit analysis, I don't think you can justify it,\" Lezak says. \"Gold mining is just as destructive as coal mining, and unlike coal, can't heat a home or fuel a power station.\" Lezak says that he supports mining minerals that are crucial to the energy transition - such as copper, nickel and lithium - but the fact that only 7% of gold is used for technology or medicine (as opposed to jewelry or stores of wealth) makes the environmental damage and risk to health too costly to bear.\nBut that's the thing about gold. The human desire for its sparkle has never been a question of need, only want. The violence and displacement, suffering and grief that have accompanied the quest for gold have not yet managed to turn our eyes away from its gleam. In that way, it's a perfect emblem for Trump - garish, useless, drenched in blood.\n\"The president's fascination with gold is part of a timeless tradition of human's liking shiny objects,\" Lezak says. \"You can tell the story of a lot of human history as a story of men in power wanting shiny objects, whether it's the Spanish looking for silver in the Andes or European Americans looking for gold in California and Alaska.\n\"History does not look back favorably on those leaders,\" he added. \"I wish the president had a little more perspective.\"",
      "ml_hf_summary": "On Monday, Donald Trump met with El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele. The meeting was marked by Trump's ostentatious use of gold in the Oval Office and Bukele's subsequent reversal of El Salvador's ban on mining metals.  Bukele claimed that El Salvador has untapped gold reserves worth $3 trillion, leading to a repeal of the historic ban. This move sparked concerns from environmental activists who fear the potential for mercury-based mining practices. While some argue that gold is essential for technological advancements, others highlight the environmental damage and health risks associated with open pit mining.  The article concludes by comparing Trump's fascination with gold to a timeless human desire for shiny objects, highlighting the historical consequences of such pursuits. \n"

They haven't\nIt was bound to happen.\nEncouraged by the ease with which many big US institutions caved in to their demands, the Trump regime - that is, the small cadre of bottom-feeding fanatics around Donald Trump (JD Vance, Elon Musk, Russell Vought, Stephen Miller and RFK Jr) along with the child king himself - have overreached.\nThey've dared China, Harvard and the supreme court to blink.\nBut guess what? They've met their matches. None of them has blinked - and they won't.\nChina not only refused to back down when the Trump regime threatened it with huge tariffs, but also retaliated with huge tariffs of its own, plus a freeze on the export of rare-earth elements that the US's high-tech and defense industries depend on.\nHarvard also pointedly defied the regime, issuing a clear rebuke to its attempt to interfere with academic freedom.\nThe supreme court - in a rare unanimous decision - ordered Trump to facilitate the return of a legal US resident wrongly deported to a dangerous prison in El Salvador, without any criminal charges.\nBut the White House was defiant. On Monday, both Trump officials and El Salvador's president, Nayib Bukele, said they could not return Kilmar Abrego Garcia.\n\"Of course, I'm not going to do it,\" Bukele said when asked.

The US attorney general, Pam Bondi, joined in the cruel imitation of justice: \"That's up to El Salvador if they want to return him.\"\nWhat's next?\nI suspect the testosterone-poisoned lackeys around King Trump are urging him to hit back even harder, escalating their confrontations with China, Harvard and the supreme court.

      "ml_hf_summary": "The Trump administration's confrontations with China, Harvard, and the Supreme Court have escalated despite their attempts to intimidate these institutions.  China retaliated against US tariffs by imposing its own tariffs and restricting rare-earth element exports. Harvard refuted the administration's attempt to interfere with academic freedom.

Despite this, the author believes that Trump's allies are urging him to escalate these confrontations, viewing them as tests of his power.  The author suggests that if Trump escalates these conflicts, he will be exposed as lacking real power and that he should de-escalate instead. \n"

      "content": "From Verdi to Douglas Adams, artists and writers have wrestled with why we are here. The Christian festival gives us pause to reflect\nChristians are to be envied at Easter. The story of death and resurrection, suffering and rebirth is a beautiful and all-encompassing one. For non-believers, a diet of chocolate and wall-to-wall snooker, and the prospect of a perhaps drizzly bank holiday, do not have the same teleological logic. The religious narrative gives life meaning. The notion that there is a plan and purpose is deeply satisfying.\nThe last line of Kenneth Williams' diary encapsulates the conundrum we all face: \"Oh, what's the bloody point?\" James Bailey's new book, The Meaning of Life, sought answers to that vexing question from a variety of what Bailey calls \"extraordinary people\". Like a philosophically inclined Henry Root, Bailey - \"unemployed, heartbroken and living alone in my dead grandad's caravan\" - sent more than a thousand letters to well-known artists and philosophers, and to people who had suffered some tragedy that might, he thought, give them special insight into life's purpose and meaning.\nSome replied at length, and, for many, the meaning of life resided in love or small acts of kindness. But it was the pithier contributions that had more impact. The writer Michael Frayn gently mocked the whole exercise. \"It might be an idea to start with something smaller, say a pickled walnut,\" he replied. \"Once we've got it clear how a pickled walnut could have a 'meaning', we might move on to something larger - the borough of Haringey, say, or influenza - and work our way up.\" Great age, it seems, brings its own bleak wisdom. \"Sorry, but you caught me at the wrong end of my existence,\" the playwright Alan Ayckbourn grumbled. \"I have no idea why I write, nor indeed why I'm still alive.\"\nThe young seek meaning and purpose. The old have no time for it. \"Tutto nel mondo e burla,\" sings Falstaff at the end of Verdi's valedictory opera. All the world's a joke. Verdi, feted for his tragic endings, was having his own little joke in fashioning this ebullient finale. Ayckbourn reaches the same Falstaffian conclusion. \"What the hell?\" he concludes in his response to Bailey. Many artists have followed a similar path - from floridity and purpose to concision and irresolution. Fail again, fail better. Religion and art are often antagonists: one feeds on certainty, the other on doubt.\nIn Douglas Adams' The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, the supercomputer Deep Thought gives 42 as the answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe and Everything. Fans of Adams' work earnestly asked him what the number meant. \"It was a joke,\" he insisted. \"It had to be a number, an ordinary, smallish number ... I sat at my desk, stared into the garden and thought '42 will do'.\" Decoding the meaning of life, Adams is wittily suggesting, is a mug's game. Cracking the meaning of pickled walnuts may indeed be more fulfilling.\nIf this Easter you are celebrating the working out of a divine plan, enjoy Sunday's magnificent reawakening. If not, put your faith in Montaigne's answer to Williams' great philosophical inquiry. \"If you have been able to examine and manage your own life, you have achieved the greatest task of all,\" he writes in his final essay, On Experience. \"Our most glorious achievement is to live our life fittingly. All other things - reigning, building, accumulating wealth - are at most small props, superfluous accessories.\" A life well lived has its own logic.",
      "ml_hf_summary": "James Bailey's book \"The Meaning of Life\" sought answers to the question of life's purpose from a diverse group of artists and philosophers.  He sent over 1000 letters, receiving responses ranging from those who found meaning in love or small acts of kindness to more humorous replies like Michael Frayn's suggestion of starting with a pickled walnut. Many artists expressed uncertainty about the meaning of life, echoing the sentiment of playwright Alan Ayckbourn and author Douglas Adams, who both concluded that finding the answer is ultimately futile.  In contrast, philosopher Montaigne emphasized living a fulfilling life as the greatest achievement, suggesting that true purpose lies in fittingly navigating one's own existence. \n"

      "content": "Readers share their own family experiences of life in Ireland, in response to an article by Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett \nRhiannon Lucy Cosslett's article on the enduring pain caused by the church-run mother-and-baby homes in Ireland was a powerful read, leaving me full of anger and indignation (Ireland's mother-and-baby homes are a stain on the Catholic church - but this latest refusal to atone is a new low, 13 April).

My aunt's experiences were heartbreaking: in the late 1960s, she was effectively imprisoned in a home for \"fallen women\", her baby taken from her for adoption almost immediately after birth. It's a loss that stayed with her for the rest of her life.\nMy mother's experiences reflected the general poverty and cruelty of Irish society in the late 1940s. Desperately hungry and neglected, brutalised by her brother who'd returned from the second world war with PTSD, she ran away from home and presented herself at a Magdalene laundry. Although she was subjected to a demeaning medical examination to see if she was pregnant (she wasn't) and made to work long hours, the laundry provided her with a better standard of living than she'd hitherto known - regular meals, a bed free of vermin and, paradoxically, given the reputation of the laundries, freedom from physical violence. Her life must have been truly miserable if a laundry was preferable to her family home.\nIreland was such a cruel place that my mother escaped to England aged just 16. Her experiences, I'm sure, are why my family never holidayed in the \"old country\" or wore shamrocks on Saint Patrick's Day. Name and address supplied\n The intergenerational damage done by the Catholic church lives on. Remember that church leaders attributed imbecilic behaviour and muteness to children born outside wedlock. To be such a child meant that your chances of living a decent life after being in any institution of shame (mother-and-baby home, industrial school, Magdalene laundry, mental health institution) was zero. No employer would hire you and your chances of marriage were low. And your chances of looking at the world through the bars of a prison cell or mental institution were a lot higher unless you could keep your secret - an impossibility in a country made up of hundreds of small insular towns.\nAnd, of course, the men got off scot-free, with no blemish on their reputations. They thrived, while sowing their oats. Not so the young, single and vulnerable girls during a time of reproductive health ignorance. Their families, overwhelmed with the church's currency of shame, threw them to the wolves. Why do you think more Irish women emigrated to the UK than Irish men? And the good nuns have the gall to say \"It wasn't me\".Rosemary C AdaserNortholt, London\n Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett is right about the Magdalene laundries being a stain on the church. But it was families who sent their daughters to those places. My father remembered illegitimate children in 1950s Mayo being given to families to work on their farms, effectively as slave labour. The dysfunction and evil in Ireland was across the board. It's too easy to pin it all on priests and nuns, as if they were separate from wider society. What sort of families did they come from to need to be so abusive? Not happy and healthy ones.Catherine McLoughlinLondon\n Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett's article was sobering, and raised my anger at how women and children were treated by the religious orders mentioned. But I am struck once again by the fact that there is no mention of the men - the fathers of all these children. These were not virgin births, after all.

Another recounted their mother's experience at a Magdalene laundry, where she faced poverty and neglect but found a better standard of living than her home environment.  The article highlights the intergenerational damage caused by societal cruelty and the church's role in perpetuating shame and stigma against unmarried mothers and children born outside wedlock.

      "content": "Teenager looked at home in Bernabeu contest as Mikel Arteta's side celebrated progress six years in the making\nWhere is la remontada? Seriously. There really was supposed to be a remontada around here somewhere. Of all the sprinkles of sugar, the crispy, salty, crunchy morsels for Arsenal's supporters to pick over after Wednesday night's brilliantly assured victory at the Bernabeu it is probably Myles Lewis-Skelly's part that will give the most lasting satisfaction.\nSadly for the banter-angle it seems the immediate post-match rumour that Lewis-Skelly had approached Jude Bellingham and asked him: 'Where is la remontada?', as recycled across social media in a dizzying range of languages, turns out to have been, of all things, made up.\nPresumably someone somewhere is already overseeing a furious first press of T-shirts and commemorative bucket hats carrying Lewis-Skelly's new strapline. The memes will endlessly replicate. Already a backlash against the backlash is insisting, without evidence, that Lewis-Skelly did actually say this after all. We're post-truth here people. Does it actually matter, if enough convincingly clipped-up noise is generated? There are fine people on both sides here.\nMore to the point, phantom Lewis-Skelly was right. There was no improbable act of sporting fan-fiction at the Bernabeu. And Lewis-Skelly, perhaps more than anyone else on the pitch, got to act out his own version of remontada-denialism, a tribute to the power and the clarity of being too young and too cool to care about That Thing Everyone Goes On About.\nIt is worth remembering on nights like these that Lewis-Skelly is still only 18. He has still played only 17 Premier League games. He also still isn't really a full-back, more an ongoing hunch-based conversion.\nNo good has ever come from trying to predict the ceiling of a prodigiously talented footballer. What kind of player is he anyway? Utility marauder. Polyvalent semi-defender. All-purpose shithouse scamp. Lewis-Skelly had already got under Bellingham's skin during the first leg, and the relationship is clearly a grower.\nBellingham made Lewis-Skelly's goal on his England debut last month. He has now helped to make him a star, or a proxy-star in the Champions League disinformation wars, just as Erling Haaland did something similar at the Etihad in September after appearing to ask exactly who the cocky and abrasive youth in the No 49 shirt actually was. There he goes, out there taking them down one by one. Get this kid on the pitch with Messi before it wears off.\nLewis-Skelly has some very obvious gifts: tactical intelligence, inventive passing, bullocking dribbling style, understated physical strength. For now it is surely enough to enjoy the fact he was good enough to disrupt Real Madrid's midfield in the first leg by wandering into awkward positions at just the right moments; and at the Bernabeu to disrupt something more profound, the enduring, indestructible pomposity of Madridismo itself.\nThis is Lewis-Skelly's one obvious super-strength at this stage. Here is a footballer who is clearly an absolute dog of war on the pitch, an attitude monster, and in a fascinating way too, a teenager who seems totally at home with this goldfish-bowl world, and who has in the process become the spirit animal of Arsenal's Champions League run.\nThe mythology of this place was also long overdue a youthful puncturing. Visiting the Bernabeu is not like other games, but only perhaps because everyone keeps saying so. The energy in the stands is more devotional than sporting. English crowds tend to comment constantly on the game. The mood is reactive fury.\nAt the Bernabeu people seem to be speaking to the skies, waving their arms wide as though summing down spirits. Before kick off on Wednesday night a vast tifo was unfurled across the home end portraying some kind of mythical bearded white-clad Madrid god toying with the chessboard of mortal human affairs. Which was nice. Here we are. Being Madrid, self-consciously imperious, cosplaying Galactic Super Race.\nBellingham had been at the centre of the invoking of spirits in the buildup, putting on a pretty decent show of suggesting somehow that football's ultimate overlords were in fact underdogs, out there battling manfully against the pressure of expectation. But yeah, it's fine, this is what we do, this is actually perfect for us.\nIt might have worked too. For Arsenal this was an occasion shot through with genuine jeopardy at kick-off. Lewis-Skelly's own first act at the Bernabeu was to get a little lost under a bouncing ball as Madrid ganged up on his flank, at which point you slightly feared for him.\nA few minutes later, in almost the same spot, he dropped a shoulder, twirled away from Bellingham, and the game began to stretch out in front of him.\nAbove all this was a huge moment for Mikel Arteta. Just imagine the toxic consequences, the unshakable stigma if this tie had gone the other way from that first leg 3-0 lead, if Kylian Mbappe wasn't offside while putting the ball in the net with two minutes gone, if Madrid's soft but still viable penalty kick hadn't been scrubbed.\nSign up to Football Daily\nKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of football\nafter newsletter promotion\nThat first-leg lead always looked a genuine fork in the road for Arteta's Arsenal. Either lose from there and face the ultimate, boss-level expression of Arsenal flakiness, Arsenal celebration crimes, stern-faced club legends talking urgently about the absence of Real Men.\nOr win and get to bask in the opposite of this, a register of genuine progress six years in the making. There was even vindication for the suggestion Arsenal's failure to run away with the league might not be down to pigeon-chested cowardice, but the loss of their key attacking combination for almost the entire season. A disappointingly non-juicy narrative. But there was some convincing evidence here it may actually be true.\nFor now a Champions League semi-final is a hard, unarguable achievement. This is now a good Arsenal season, with a delicious-looking final lap as spring melts into summer. Arsenal have eight games, maybe nine, still to play. They have a trip to Paris. They have time to rest players while cruising towards a third successive second-place league finish, only the third time any Arsenal managerial era has managed this.\nAll of this with Mikel Merino still gamely wheeling out his karaoke turn as a pop-up striker, with the Skelly-Saka-Nwaneri emotional premium, and with a European run that will now rake in at least EUR118m (PS101m) according to the financial blogger the Swiss Ramble, powerful ammunition for the coming summer transfer wrestle.\nAt which point, before the Bernabeu glow fades, it is worth noting that Paris Saint-Germain are a far more serious prospect, opponents that will stretch this team in very different directions. Strip away the voodoo and Real Madrid are a pretty awful team right now, and awful in ways that fit snugly with Arsenal's strengths.\nDeclan Rice will never find such perfect opponents again. Here is an elite team, champions of Europe, draped in champion mythology, but with no actual functioning midfield. Your direct opponent is a Ballon d'Or winner. Your direct opponent is also the 39-year-old part-owner of Swansea City. Get out there and run right over the top of him.\nRice understood the assignment perfectly, sinking his teeth into this tie from the opening seconds. PSG are something else. Like Arsenal they also have a three-man midfield of thrilling intensity. Unlike Madrid, they also have a supremely well-balanced attack.\nFor Mbappe in particular this was supposed to be a coronational year, final step on that golden ladder towards the optics of ultimacy, the ticker-tape podium, the appalling purple tuxedo, the Ballon d'Or smile.\nInstead these two games provided further evidence of a built-in Mbappe obsolescence, a star player who will score goals and give you moments, but will also consume the team around him. In Spain there is a view the thrashing of Manchester City in February was the worst thing that could have happened to Madrid. It made them think they were still good, a team that thrive in a broken game, all the better to pull you apart with their superior invention. There wasn't any of that here. Madrid played in straight lines, and just kept running into the same Arteta-built defensive geometry.\nA single result doesn't make an era. But sport is also about steps along the way. And while the Bernabeu might not have dished up another of its hammy old remontadas, it may just stand as another small staging post in the ongoing monta of Arteta's Arsenal.",
      "ml_hf_summary": "Arsenal defeated Real Madrid 4-1 at the Bernabeu Stadium in a Champions League semi-final match.  Myles Lewis-Skelly scored the first goal for Arsenal and disrupted Real Madrid's midfield throughout the game. The victory was significant as it gave Arsenal a 3-0 lead from the first leg, which they maintained despite facing strong opposition. This win marks a major step forward for the team, especially considering their previous struggles in the league.  The next stage of the competition will be against Paris Saint-Germain, who pose a different challenge with their own formidable midfield and attack. \n"

      "content": "Rangers' resistance lasted for over two hours and then a briefer rebellion brought hope that they could do something truly extraordinary but reaching the semi-final of the Europa League was a step too far.

Rangers still might have been revived when Nicolas Raskin hit the post, but in the end Athletic were too good, racking up 21 shots here, 40 over the two legs, until the 41st was headed in by Nico Williams, the nerves finally gone at San Mames, the stadium they call the Cathedral, and replaced by songs of praise.\nRangers actually had the first shot here, James Tavernier's free-kick flying high into the stands, but the second leg very soon looked a lot like the first and by half-time they had added just one more; Athletic, by contrast, had 15 of them to go with the 19 at Ibrox. This was, above all, about holding Athletic back again. On the left Nico Williams ran at them, Ridvan Yilmaz seeing Williams nutmeg him before being forced off with an early injury that reinforced the idea that what Rangers had to do was resist. On the right, Oscar de Marcos was the man most often providing the balls into the box. In the middle, Maroan Sannadi, a huge, broad centre-forward who was playing third-tier football three months ago, was becoming a key figure.\nAthletic were dominating, although Rangers might have been handed an opportunity when Cyriel Dessers went tumbling in the area. He said he had been pulled by Dani Vivian and he had the proof of it too: a gaping hole in the front of his shirt. All the referee gave though was a yellow card to Dessers for returning to the field too fast after changing. When they broke up field soon after, space momentarily opening, Vaclav Cerny decided to take on the shot from 50 yards. Caught by Julen Agirrezabala, it felt not so much like an excess of confidence as a lack of it, snatching at the first sight rather than carrying the ball further. The \"ooh\" from the Athletic fans came from a place of fun, not fear.\nThat was Rangers' second shot; at the other end they were accumulating. They were becoming clearer too. De Marcos set up Sannadi for a shot wide that was very similar to one he missed at Ibrox, low by the near post. An outrageous piece of control from Sancet made another opportunity, Alex Berenguer eventually bending wide. And then Sannadi rolled past Tavernier and Yilmaz to set up Nico Williams. Drawn to the move, Kelly was out of his goal but incredibly Williams shot wide.\nAnd then at last it happened, three minutes into added time at the end of the half. Sannadi was clipped by John Souttar. Athletic had another penalty; this time it was Sancet who took it, not Berenguer, and this time Kelly couldn't stop it, San Mames erupting in relief.\nIt was still just one goal, and Athletic knew that. They weren't going to sit on this, aware that for all the dominance a single moment could change everything. Rangers too knew that, and when that opportunity came they so very nearly took it too. Cerny was taken down near the edge of the area and while his free-kick hit the wall, the loose ball was lobbed back into the box where Dessers swung at an overhead kick, the ball scuffed but falling at the feet of Raskin. Six yards out, on the turn, he struck the post via the body of the onrushing Agirrezabala.\nSign up to Football Daily\nKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of football\nafter newsletter promotion\nOn the touchline, Ferguson's head was in his hands. Among the Athletic supporters in the stands, the nerves returned then and again when Cerny, Rangers' most dangerous man, clipped up a cross that almost found Dessers at the far post. Even more so when Cerny cut inside and hit a shot at Agirrezabala that, 68 minutes into the second leg, was their first shot on target in the tie but threatened not to be the last.\nFor a moment, it was Rangers' supporters who could be singing now, hope revived at the Cathedral. But Athletic responded, still coming, determined not to leave this to chance. Vivian shot over, Berenguer curled wide and with 10 minutes to go a perfect delivery found Nico Williams at the far post and he headed this place into raptures and his team into the semi-final. ",

      "content": "Enzo Maresca is still not feeling the love. This was another uneven performance from Chelsea, who at times seemed intent on raising Legia Warsaw's hopes of a comeback for the ages, and few at Stamford Bridge seemed minded to celebrate their side securing a Conference League semi-final.\nIt was not supposed to be this difficult. Legia were 2-1 winners on the night and there were times when Chelsea, who went through 4-2 on aggregate, toyed with humiliation. Filip Jorgensen, Robert Sanchez's understudy, was jittery in goal and the worries for Maresca extended to Palmer failing to take an opportunity to end his barren run against meagre opposition. Palmer, who has gone 15 games without a goal, cut a frustrated figure in the final third. He was not alone.\nNobody turned up expecting that they might be about to witness a Polish remontada. The main intrigue revolved around why Enzo Maresca chose to name such a strong side when Chelsea led 3-0 from the first leg. There was no rest for Marc Cucurella at left-back and if there was surprise at Palmer and Nicolas Jackson starting in attack, it was possible to interpret an evening in the company of the Ekstraklasa's fifth best side as an opportunity for both forwards to play themselves back into form before the run-in.\nThat seemed a sound enough theory when Palmer surged through in the second minute, only to send a wonky shot wide. Would his goal drought ever end? The frustration gnawed at Palmer. He spurned another chance moments later, failing to turn in a rebound after Jackson had a shot saved by Vladan Kovacevic, and the gamble was looking decidedly foolish when a nasty challenge from Tomas Pekhart left Chelsea's chief creator hobbling in the 20th minute.\nChelsea were behind by that stage, Pekhart squeezing a penalty past Jorgensen after being fouled by the goalkeeper, and were far from secure. The first hint of discontent from the home support came when Ryoya Morishita ran through on the right and shot just wide.\nThe topless travelling fans carried on singing. It was left to Cucurella, Chelsea's top scorer in 2025, to calm the growing unease, equalising from close range when Jadon Sancho delivered a good ball from the right.\nJackson, without a goal since December, was replaced by Tyrique George at half-time. But Chelsea's distribution was poor and a mistake from Josh Acheampong almost led to Claude Goncalves heading past Jorgensen.\nThis will not go down as one of Chelsea's great defensive performances in Europe. Tosin Adarabioyo and Benoit Badiashile were unconvincing in the middle and there was inertia when Legia regained the lead, everyone in blue ball-watching as a corner was recycled and Steve Kapuadi bundled in from six yards out.\nSign up to Football Daily\nKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of football\nafter newsletter promotion\nChelsea began to panic, Jorgensen nervily pushing another cross away. Now the crowd booed. Maresca responded by taking off Palmer for Noni Madueke. Kovacevic soon had to make a series of eye-catching saves. Jorgensen, meanwhile, came close to conceding another penalty after spilling an effort from Luquinhas.\nChelsea, who had not tasted defeat in this competition before, escaped. They will have to better in the next round. There cannot be many teams who have been booed off after reaching the semi-finals of a European competition before.",
      "ml_hf_summary": "Chelsea faced Legia Warsaw in the Conference League semi-final, ultimately losing 2-1 on aggregate despite leading 3-0 from the first leg.  Enzo Maresca fielded a strong starting lineup but struggled to maintain control, with Filip Jörgensen's shaky performance and Chelsea's lackluster attacking contributing to their downfall.  Despite early goals by Armando Broja and Nicolas Jackson, Chelsea conceded two goals in the second half, including a penalty from Tomas Pekhart. The home crowd grew increasingly frustrated as Chelsea failed to secure a victory, leading to boos directed at the team. Despite reaching the semi-finals, Chelsea will need to improve their defensive performance and offensive execution if they hope to advance further in the competition. \n"

      "content": "As the first climate summit in the Amazon approaches, a gulf is opening between what the area's farming lobby wants, and what the world needs\nYellowstone in Montana may have the most romanticised cowboy culture in the world thanks to the TV drama series of the same name starring Kevin Costner. But the true home of the 21st-century cowboy is about 7,500 miles south, in what used to be the Amazon rainforest of Brazil, where the reality of raising cattle and producing beef is better characterised by depression, market pressure and vexed efforts to prevent the destruction of the land and its people.\nThe toll was apparent along the rutted PA 279 road in Para state. Signs of human and environmental stress were not hard to find during the last dry season. Record drought had dried up irrigation ponds and burned pasture grass down to the roots, leaving emaciated cattle behind the fences. Exposed red soil was whipped up into dust devils as SUVs and cattle trucks sped past on their way between Xinguara and Sao Felix do Xingu, which is home to both the biggest herd on the planet and the fastest erasure of forest in the Amazon.\nLater this year, Para will host the Cop30 climate conference, which would be an ideal moment for Brazil to demonstrate progress on a new system to track livestock and reduce emissions from deforestation. That system should be completed by the end of 2026. But few ranchers believe this will happen because of the huge gulf between what locals want and what the world needs.\nThe first ranchers here were once told they were heroes for opening new economic frontiers. But the climate crisis has dealt a triple blow to their reputation and their livelihoods: not only has it become harder to feed and water their livestock, they now face criticism for wrecking a biodiverse pillar of the global environment while also bearing the brunt of conflicting demands from multinational food corporations to provide food that is both economically cheap and ecologically ethical.\nAt a time when humanity is breaching more and more environmental limits, this challenge is more than many can bear.\n\"What is our biggest disease today? Depression. That's what is killing the most (producers),\" says Thaueny Stival, the owner of a mid-sized ranch in the small town of Agua Azul do Norte.\nA thoughtful man who says he is trying to modernise and do the right thing, Stival says ranchers are struggling to cope with rapidly changing perceptions about food production. When pioneers first arrived in this region in the 1980s, he says, they were encouraged to clear forest by Brazil's government (then a military dictatorship). Banks would not give them loans unless they cleared most of their land.\nThat partial and romanticised story of Amazon colonisation from half a century ago has been overtaken by more recent and brutal changes. In this region, the vast majority of ranchers have invaded public lands without permission. Now there is growing evidence that the deforestation that followed is pushing the Amazon to the point of no return, with dire consequences for the world's climate. The result is that the ranchers who once considered themselves national heroes are now treated as global pariahs.\nStival says the average rancher is suffering beyond endurance. \"Now he is seeing his assets being diluted by government rules and corporate regulations ... and soon he will not be able to sell his product, and he will have financial difficulties. What will he do? Either he will commit suicide, or he will become depressed. The guy says: 'I did everything and now I can't support my family?'\"\nIt's a common lament in the Amazon ranching community, and one that helps to explain why populist politicians such as the former president Jair Bolsonaro and the US president, Donald Trump, have such an appeal. It taps straight into the existential debate about the role of frontier men and women - farmers, miners, oil workers - in a world where wide-open spaces are increasingly constrained by environmental limits.\nThe economist Kenneth Boulding wrote six decades ago about the need for humanity to transition away from a \"cowboy economy\" of endless frontiers and unlimited growth towards a \"spaceman economy\" that would treat the Earth as a giant life-support system, carefully managing and cycling finite resources while strengthening ways to capture and use the unlimited energy provided by the sun. For oil workers, miners, and ranchers, these are not philosophical discussions, but attacks on their existence, on what they do every single day. They are life-or-death issues that create uncertainty and insecurity and help to foster political extremism.\nThe revolt of the cowboys helps to explain the rise of far right demagogues but it doesn't change the reality of the climate crisis, which is driven by physics and chemistry, not opinion and politics. The question is not whether change will come, but how soon and how disruptive it will be. Ranchers have started to see with their own eyes how the Amazonian climate is becoming more hostile. And some are responding.\nStival says he is now investing in genetically enhanced livestock, chemical fertiliser and other technology to improve efficiency, rather than expanding through the clearance of more forest. This is a common claim in the region, though researchers say the change is incremental and largely driven by necessity - there is very little forest left to cut down.\nStival insists the mindset of ranchers has shifted: \"We used to look at the land as a table, we just wanted to make it bigger, but today we look at it as a building. We want to increase productivity in a smaller area.\"\nBut he complains authorities are placing too much of a burden on farmers. \"No one can get a loan from a bank any more because [they are told] 'Oh, that area of yours is not reforested,\" he laments. \"And in a little while your cattle will be illegal cattle, then what are you going to do?\"\nHe is referring to plans - promised by JBS - the world's largest meat producer, which is the majority buyer from ranchers in the Amazon - for a new birth-to-abattoir tracking system that will, supposedly by the end of this year, tag and trace every head of cattle in the Amazon to ensure none of them are raised in areas that have been deforested. An investigation by the Guardian and its partners suggests this deadline will be missed. JBS told the Guardian that it respectfully contested the conclusions of the investigation, but added that \"while the sector-wide challenges are significant and larger than any one company can solve on its own, we believe JBS has an in-depth and robust series of integrated policies, systems, and investments that are making a material and positive impact on reducing deforestation risks\".\nThe company have so far not succeeded in mapping the entire supply chain, a target due, under its deforestation commitments, to be completed by the end of this year, but a spokesperson told the Guardian JBS has enrolled the equivalent of \"more than 80% of its annual cattle purchases\" onto the blockchain-enabled platform. \"As you are aware, the challenges of addressing illegal deforestation on cattle operations that span millions of farms across hundreds of thousands of square kilometeres are significant.\" Its response includes a zero tolerance for deforestation sourcing policy, state-of-the-art supply-chain monitoring, free technical assistance for producers to help regularise their farms, and the JBS fund for the Amazon, as well as working with partners to implement solutions and develop protocols such as the Beef on Track initiative in the Amazon biome. \"Cattle-raising in the Amazon is undergoing a sectoral transformation, and one company cannot solve all the industry's challenges.\"\nStival accepts that change is needed, but he says neither JBS nor the authorities are doing enough to meet the year-end deadline because the scale of environmental violations and confusion over land in southern Para is just too enormous. Asked if JBS can put its new system in place by December, he shakes his head: \"There is no way.\"\nThe same mood of frustration and dismay is evident at the next town, a few hundred kilometres further along the road. \"This won't be resolved by the end of 2026,\" says Francival Cassiono do Rego, the president of the Tucuma-Ourilandia Union of Rural Producers. \"About 80% of the producers in this region don't have a definitive title. We have been trying to resolve this for 20, 30 years and no one has come up with a solution.\"\nResearchers say that is largely because that many farmers are suspected of invading their land, but Cassiono do Rego blames the EU - the world's biggest market - for passing a deforestation-free trade rule that has prompted JBS and Brazilian authorities to step up monitoring. Like many ranchers, Cassiono do Rego sees this as a tactic in a trade war driven by foreign farmers who want to weaken the competition offered by cheap Amazonian beef.\nAdelosmar Antonio Orio, a sprightly 82-year-old rancher more widely known as \"Ticao\", insists the environment is a secondary concern compared to land regularisation. \"The biggest concern today for cattle ranchers here is this legal uncertainty. We've already lost a partner, a comrade. He put a gun to his head and killed himself ... It wasn't just one person, it was several. It's happened before ... Pressure and depression come. But there is no solution.\"\nEnvironmentalists, scientists and public defenders argue that many of these woes are self-inflicted. Countless ranchers are out of legal compliance, they argue, because they invaded land or broke rules on forest clearance. At several points in the past decade, Sao Felix do Xingu has had the dubious distinction of contributing more greenhouse gases than any of the other 5,000 municipalities in Brazil, according to the civil society coalition the Climate Observatory, as a result of burning forests to create pasture for its 2.5m cattle. It is largely thanks to places like this that Brazilian agriculture has a more destructive carbon footprint than the industrial powerhouse of Japan.\nAnd rather than clean up, many in the beef industry have simply found loopholes that allow them to carry on with the old ways. \"Cattle laundering\", which hides the origins of livestock from environmentally embargoed ranches, is so widespread that few farmers bother to hide what they are doing.\nThe expansion of JBS has run right alongside this. Since the 1970s, while the rainforest has lost about 20% of its cover, the company has opened or acquired 21 slaughterhouses in the legal Amazon and built a network of 19,000 suppliers in the region. Despite frequent promises to clean up its supply chain, the company has repeatedly been found to be buying from farmers who illegally cleared forest.\nJBS's latest \"global commitment\" is for deforestation-free supply chains by the end of 2025. It has established a network of \"green offices\" to provide free consultation to ranchers on how to meet the requirements of its new hi-tech tracking platform. At the Tucuma meatpacking plant, a company representative, Vitoria Batista, explained how artificial intelligence and WhatsApp messaging would remotely monitor supplier farms and advise ranchers on regulatory and corporate requirements.\n\"We need to break paradigms,\" she says. JBS pays for outside consultants to help ranchers move into compliance. \"It's all done by women,\" Batista says. \"The first impression [of the producers] is not easy, but then they understand and they see for themselves that it is necessary, that there is no way to get away from it, that they have to regularise.\"\nAt another Amazonian frontier town, Rondon do Para, a windowless, air-conditioned lecture room is the setting for a meeting about land and how to modernise its productivity. Big outdoor men hunch behind small desks and listen to consultants and lawyers, who show PowerPoint presentations on market trends, cattle tracing, pasture maintenance, daily weight gain, soil analysis, fertiliser inputs, herbicide costs, environmental embargos, indigenous land rights and rainfall shortages. In short, all the legal and data-driven essentials for the archetypal rancher of the 21st-century world.\nA keynote speaker at this Encontro dos Pecuaristas (meeting of the Livestock Farmers) is the lawyer and land-owner Vinicius Borba, a slim man with a thin beard and a sharp turn of phrase. Borba says he represents rural producers in the indigenous territory of Apyterewa. Before the meeting, he had spoken defiantly about his own environmental penalties and accusations of wrongdoing, which he blamed on the government's failure to legitimise his property. \"I am called a land-grabber, an invader, a deforester, but it is not my fault,\" he said. \"I have a property that we have occupied for over 20 years, and to this day the government has not given me the title ... Since the regularisation never comes, I end up becoming a statistic, another land-grabber.\"\nBorba says ranchers are victims of environmental policy shifts. \"What we see today is a rule being changed in the middle of the game,\" he tells the gathering of ranchers. \"I don't think it's fair, I don't think it's legal, but it's our reality.\"\nHe argues, like many Brazilians, that double standards are being applied, because Europe has already cleared most of its forests. What he omits to mention is that the forests of Europe were mainly cleared several centuries ago, when there was no inkling of the climate impact. Today, those consequences are unmistakable. As Borba gives his address, the Amazon is suffering its second year of debilitating drought. For decades, rainy seasons have been shrinking along with the rainforest. This is hard on farmers as well as the global climate.\nBeyond the heroic stories of carving through the forest, Amazonian cattle ranching is actually propped up by hefty subsidies. Perverse commercial incentives encourage farmers to destroy forest. The most lucrative profits come from a mark-up of land valuations after territory is seized and occupied by cattle. \"The more legal you are, the less you are worth,\" one rancher told me. \"If your land is 80% forest, then nobody wants to buy it.\"\nWith the money from property speculation, some land-grabbers have been able to fund political parties, evangelical groups and media organisations. So much is at stake that some resort to murder and violence to drive others off the land. The risks of punishment are low and the potential rewards are enormous. State governors and municipal mayors may come from the agriculture and extractive industries, many of which grew powerful by seizing land. The \"ruralist bloc\" has a powerful presence in the national congress, and had a particularly powerful influence on the presidency during the 2019-2023 era of Jair Bolsonaro.\nBut there are also ranchers who believe change will usher in a better future. Mauro Lucio Costa is every inch the model, modern rancher. His traditional cowboy attire - Texas Stetson, crisp white shirt, big belt buckle, blue jeans and brown boots - belies his use of advanced husbandry technology and environmentally progressive land management practices on his extensive farm. He is compliant with forest code requirements that he preserve 80% of the vegetation, yet, thanks to careful selection of livestock and minutely calibrated fertiliser inputs, he has one of the most productive and profitable farms in the Amazon. Ten years ago, he established his own supply-chain tracing system. Initially, he says, this was not for environmental motives but as a management tool that would help him to improve the quality of his herd and reassure customers. \"I started this in 2015, because it was clear to me that the market would demand it,\" he said.\nOnce he started looking, he found 40% of his cattle and 30% of his suppliers were not compliant with environmental standards. Cutting them and finding alternatives was the biggest expense of the new system - and he predicts this will also prove the case for the big meatpacking companies. To avoid this in the future, he has teamed up with a company called Niceplanet to develop a smartphone app that helps suppliers to attain compliance.\nLucio Costa peppers his speech with biblical references, a sign not just of his religious faith but his skill in winning over grassroots audiences in a realm dominated by the \"bibles, bullets and beef\" lobby. He has also persuaded prominent conservationists, although others have doubts about the chemical inputs he is adding to soil to increase pasture productivity and weight gain in his stock. Lucio Costa also has the ear of senior figures in JBS and the government, and is often held up as an example of the gains that could come from effective monitoring and greater intensification.\nHe is working to help JBS implement its tracing system, and unlike most people interviewed for this story, he believes it can be done by the end of this year. The alternative, he says, is almost too terrible to contemplate: the company's withdrawal from its three meatpacking centres in southern Para. \"It would close its plants here, which would cause JBS no problem at all because it has plants all over the world ... but for us producers in Para, it would be a huge loss.\" That is why, he says, he is trying to persuade ranchers to embrace the change, even though JBS is a competitor to his family's own meatpacking facility. \"When it comes to livestock farming I can't just look out for myself, I have to look out for livestock farming, and in my view, it's very bad for livestock farming in Para if JBS leaves here.\"\nCristina Malcher, the president of the Women's Commission in Agriculture, and a Bolsonaro supporter like most ranchers we spoke to, says Brazilian meatpacking companies dictate low prices in the Amazon, sell globally for big profits, and are now trying to introduce a new transparency system that will put all the burden on ranchers, while allowing them to claim to be a sustainable company and charge higher prices. \"JBS is a cancer,\" she says. \"JBS only works in its favour. It wants the market abroad, so it comes here and sets a bunch of rules for us to follow because it has made a commitment to the world.\"\nBut she believes it is a ruse to appease foreign interests, like the tricks that the 19th-century Brazilian slavers used to fob off inspections by foreign, usually British, abolitionists. It is a way, she says, of \"pretending we cannot do anything illegal or irregular so they are able, as they say, to make something 'for the English to see'\".\nAll the same, she says, change is coming, whether ranchers like it or not. \"Unfortunately, the environmental issue is here to stay,\" she says, of the growing pressure for transparent tracking systems to eradicate deforestation from supply chains. \"If we don't wake up, we will be left out of rural production.\"",
      "ml_hf_summary": "This article paints a complex picture of the challenges and opportunities facing ranchers in the Amazon region. Here's a breakdown of some key points:\n\n**The Problem:**\n\n* **Deforestation and Illegal Land Grabbing:**  Ranchers are often implicated in illegal land grabbing, deforestation, and unsustainable practices that contribute to environmental degradation. \n* **JBS Influence:** The article highlights how large meatpacking companies like JBS exert significant influence on the industry, setting rules for ranchers while profiting from global markets. This creates a system where ranchers feel pressured to comply with these demands even if it means compromising their own sustainability and ethical practices.\n* **Lack of Transparency:**  The lack of transparency in supply chains makes it difficult to track deforestation and ensure sustainable practices throughout the entire process. \n\n**Potential Solutions:**\n\n* **Technological Advancements:** The article mentions Mauro Lúcio Costa's use of technology for tracing cattle and improving land management, which could help promote more sustainable practices.\n* **Government Regulation and Enforcement:**  The article suggests that stricter government regulations and enforcement are needed to hold ranchers accountable for their actions and ensure compliance with environmental standards. \n* **Consumer Pressure:** The article highlights the growing demand for transparency in meat production, which can put pressure on companies like JBS to adopt more sustainable practices.\n\n**Challenges and Uncertainties:**\n\n* **Political Influence:**  The article points out that political influence within Brazil's agricultural sector is a significant obstacle to change. Powerful interests often prioritize short-term profits over long-term sustainability.\n* **Economic Dependence:** Ranchers are often economically dependent on large meatpacking companies, making it difficult for them to resist pressure and adopt sustainable practices without facing financial hardship. \n\n**Overall:**\n\nThe article paints a picture of a complex situation where the pursuit of economic gain is clashing with environmental responsibility. While there's hope for change through technological advancements, stricter regulations, and increased consumer awareness, overcoming entrenched political influence and economic dependence will be crucial to achieving lasting progress in sustainable ranching practices within the Amazon region. \n\n\n**Further Questions:**\n\n* What are the specific challenges faced by ranchers in different regions of the Amazon?\n* How can technology be used to empower smaller-scale ranchers and promote more equitable distribution of resources?\n* What role can international organizations play in supporting sustainable practices and holding companies accountable for their actions? \n"

      "content": "Lawsuit focuses on day-one executive order claiming to 'unleash American energy' by boosting oil industry\nConservationists on Wednesday sued the Trump administration over its attempts to boost the oil industry by rolling back green policies.\nFiled by the environmental non-profit Center for Biological Diversity, the litigation focuses on Trump's day-one \"unleashing American energy\" executive order. In an effort to boost already booming US energy production, the emergency declaration directed federal agencies to identify all policies and regulations that \"unduly\" burden fuel producers and create \"action plans\" to weaken or remove them.\nThe lawsuit seeks information about the development of these action plans from four federal agencies: the Department of the Interior, the Department of Commerce, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Department of Agriculture's Forest Service.\nSince the executive order was passed, the administration has announced plans to eliminate scores of other green policies. Last week, for instance, it emerged that the EPA plans to eliminate long-standing requirements for polluting companies to collect and report their greenhouse gas emissions, ProPublica reported.\nThe legal challenge follows a February request for information filed by the advocacy group under the Freedom of Information Act (Foia), for which officials have not yet provided any records.\n\"Given the substantial implications for air and water, wildlife and nature, climate, public lands, and the environment generally through the development of energy resources,\" the lawsuit says, \"the Center is deeply interested in, and affected by, how the action plans implementing the Executive Order could harm, undermine, or negate the Center's longstanding efforts to protect the environment.\"\nFoia is meant to compel officials to provide access to information about the functioning of federal agencies within 20 business days of a request. Though backlogs have long been common, the advocacy group says it is concerned the Trump administration is deliberately slowing the process to block public access to information.\nThe lawsuit comes as federal agencies have slashed protections for public lands, approved air pollution permits for fossil fuel-processing facilities without environmental reviews, and gutted slews of green policies and spending plans while firing thousands of civil servants.\nIt also follows record donations to Trump's presidential campaign from oil, gas and coal companies, sparking concerns of corruption. In a June meeting at his Mar-a-Lago club, Trump infamously asked fossil fuel bosses for $1bn in campaign contributions, while vowing to unravel dozens of Biden-era environmental policies.\n\"It seems obvious that polluters and other special interests are completely in the driver's seat and probably ghost-writing all of Trump's pro-fossil fuel directives,\" said Brett Hartl, government affairs director at the Center for Biological Diversity. \"Why else would Trump officials be so defiant about illegally keeping the public in the dark?\"\nThe EPA declined to comment on the pending litigation. The White House did not respond to a request for comment.\nSign up to Headlines US\nGet the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morning\nafter newsletter promotion\nThe new lawsuit comes as part of a wave of litigation seeking transparency from the Trump administration. Green groups earlier this week sued federal officials over the removal of government webpages containing federal climate and environmental justice data; last month, another lawsuit targeted the US Department of Agriculture's erasure of climate data.\nThe Trump administration and the so-called \"department of government efficiency\", helmed by billionaire Elon Musk, pledged to be \"maximally transparent\". Yet federal officials have undercut that promise, environmentalists say, including by gutting public records teams.\n\"The Trump administration and Doge continue to dismantle environmental safeguards across the nation without a modicum of transparency,\" said Hartl.\nFoia was an important tool for environmentalists during Trump's first term. A request filed by the Sierra Club led to the former EPA administrator Scott Pruitt's resignation, and records obtained by the Center for Biological Diversity led to an investigation by the inspector general of then interior secretary David Bernhardt.",
      "ml_hf_summary": "A lawsuit filed by the Center for Biological Diversity challenges the Trump administration's \"unleashing American energy\" executive order, which aims to weaken environmental regulations impacting the oil industry. The lawsuit seeks information about action plans developed under this order from four federal agencies: Interior, Commerce, EPA, and Forest Service.  The lawsuit argues that these plans could negatively impact the environment by weakening existing green policies. This follows a pattern of actions by the Trump administration, including eliminating greenhouse gas emission reporting requirements for polluting companies and slashing environmental protections, while also receiving significant campaign donations from fossil fuel industries. The Center for Biological Diversity has previously used FOIA requests to obtain information about government operations during the Trump administration. \n"

It disclosed a position of almost 6m shares, according to Trump Media.\nShort-selling is a way of betting against a public company. An investor borrows a stock, and then sells it on; should the stock fall, the investor then buys it back and pockets the difference.\nIn a memo to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Trump Media - which trades under the ticker \"DJT\", using Trump's initials - said the total short interest in the company was 10.7m as of 31 March, according to Nasdaq, where its shares are listed, and had only risen to about 11m as of Wednesday.\nThese factors \"especially when combined with the history of suspicious trading surrounding DJT stock ... could be indications of the illegal naked short selling of DJT shares\", Trump Media claimed.\nQube did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The SEC did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nShares in Trump Media rallied by about 7% in New York on Thursday. They have fallen by more than a third this year.\nThe firm is currently seeking to branch out beyond its core Truth Social platform, and this week announced investment accounts based on themes, including \"Made in America\" and \"Energy Independence\", which align with the Trump administration's agenda.\nOn its website, Qube says it combines \"data, research, technology and trading expertise\" to \"solve the most complex challenges\".\nSign up to Business Today\nGet set for the working day - we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning\nafter newsletter promotion\nThe hedge fund was spun out of Credit Suisse in 2018, and is still led by Pierre-Yves Morlat and Laurent Laizet, former employees of the bank. It also has offices in Paris, Hong Kong, Singapore and Dubai.\nIn that time, Qube has grown quickly to rival some established giants of the industry, reportedly managing about $23bn of assets, which according to industry estimates would put it among the top 1% of hedge funds. It is also considered unusual for its lack of a New York office and collaborative corporate culture.\nAlongside its short position in Trump Media, Qube has short positions in a range of UK-listed companies, including real estate firms, fashion retailer Boohoo and bowling centre operator Hollywood Bowl Group, according to the latest disclosures with the UK's City regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority.",

He said: \"Toby Carvery must now be fully transparent with their paperwork and work with local authorities as they investigate.

      "content": "Exclusive: Mark Bridges of Farrer & Co was trustee for Rifaat al-Assad, who was charged with war crimes in 2024\nQueen Elizabeth II's private solicitor spent eight years helping to manage the offshore wealth of the uncle of the recently deposed Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad, an investigation has established.\nRifaat al-Assad became known as the \"butcher of Hama\" after allegations he played a key role in a massacre of thousands of Syrians at the city of Hama in 1982. In 2024, Switzerland formally charged him with war crimes.\nConcerns about Rifaat's activities, including his record as the head of a feared Syrian paramilitary force known as the Defense Brigades, have been publicly raised in Europe and the US by the media, human rights groups and government officials since the 1980s. He left Syria for Europe in 1984 after a failed coup against his brother.\nInquiries by the Guardian and the Bureau of Investigative Journalism have established that Mark Bridges, also known as the third Baron Bridges, served as a trustee on at least five trusts holding assets in France and Spain on behalf of Rifaat al-Assad or his relatives between 1999 and 2008.\nDuring the same period, Bridges also held one of the most prestigious legal positions in Britain: private legal adviser to the British monarch. He was Queen Elizabeth's solicitor from 2002 to 2019.\nThe findings raise questions about whether it was appropriate for the monarch's personal lawyer to take the ethical and reputational risk of working for an individual accused of human rights atrocities, in view of potential embarrassment to the queen had the connection been discovered while she was still alive.\nThere is no suggestion of any regulatory wrongdoing by Bridges, who was knighted for his services to the queen in 2019. His firm, Farrer & Co, said the trusts were established on the advice of another leading law firm, that Bridges's work for Rifaat al-Assad was in complete compliance with regulatory requirements in effect at the time and that Bridges had been presented with evidence contradicting the allegations made against him.\nThe property empire amassed by Rifaat al-Assad after his arrival in Europe spanned the most luxurious postcodes of Paris, London and the Costa del Sol.\nHis acquisitions, which he claimed were part-funded by cheques worth millions of dollars from the king of Saudi Arabia, included Witanhurst in London's Highgate - the second-largest private residence in the capital after Buckingham Palace - and a seven-storey mansion near Paris's Arc de Triomphe.\nAssad held his property empire through offshore companies and trusts, obscuring his ownership. One trust was registered in the Bahamas, while some of the purchases used shell companies in Gibraltar, a British overseas territory, before transfer to Spanish and later Maltese companies.\nIn 2014, prosecutors in France began investigating whether Rifaat al-Assad's wealth had in fact been obtained through corruption. Bridges had ceased acting as a trustee for Rifaat in 2008, his lawyers said, but continued to provide \"limited and ad-hoc\" legal advice until 2015 \"in circumstances whereby the regulatory requirements imposed on the firm were met\".\nTwo of the trusts that Bridges had managed were said to own the Spanish portion of Rifaat al-Assad's real estate empire, including a deluxe villa with swathes of land near Marbella.\nIn 2019, Spanish prosecutors alleged that these same trusts controlled shell companies holding more than 500 properties in Spain worth EUR695m (PS595m). According to the Spanish prosecutors, the offshore setup was designed to \"hide the true ownership of the huge amount of real estate properties\" and enabled the \"laundering [of] dirty money from abroad\", referring to funds allegedly stolen from the Syrian state.\nIn 2020, a French court convicted Rifaat al-Assad of tax fraud and laundering embezzled public money - primarily about $200m (PS151m) stolen from Syrian state funds and $100m in fraudulent loan agreements from Libya. Assad was sentenced to four years' imprisonment. He fled to Syria in 2021 while his conviction was under appeal.\nThough not the only trustee serving Assad, Bridges was by far the most eminent. In addition to his services to the queen, he led the private client team at Farrer, an elite law firm with a reputation forged through serving British royals and aristocrats as far back as 1769.\nThere is no evidence Bridges knew or suspected that Rifaat al-Assad's money was stolen. Assad claimed his wealth came from benefactors, including the Saudi royal family, and in 2018 the Gibraltar supreme court concluded that it had been reasonable for Rifaat's trustees to believe this story.\nThe question of Rifaat al-Assad's status as an alleged war criminal, however, is more complicated.\nIn February 1982, armed militias affiliated with the Muslim Brotherhood staged an uprising against the Assad regime in the town of Hama, in western Syria. To suppress the uprising, Syria's then president, Hafez al-Assad, Rifaat's brother, dispatched the Syrian army and a paramilitary group called the Defense Brigades.\nAn Amnesty International report published in 1983 found that while \"it is difficult to establish for certain what happened\", allegations against Syrian regime forces included \"collective execution of 70 people outside the municipal hospital\" and \"cyanide gas containers ... alleged to have been brought into the city, connected by rubber pipes to the entrances of buildings believed to house insurgents, and turned on, killing all the buildings' occupants\". It is estimated that 10,000 to 40,000 people may have been unlawfully tortured and executed.\nAs head of the paramilitaries, Rifaat al-Assad was believed to have taken a leading role in the carnage. In a 1989 book, From Beirut to Jerusalem, the journalist Thomas Friedman described how, after initial skirmishes, \"Rifaat's tactic shifted from trying to ferret out nests of Muslim Brotherhood men to simply bringing whole neighbourhoods down on their heads and burying the Brotherhood and anyone else in the way.\"\nAllegations of atrocities against Rifaat al-Assad were widely known by the point Bridges began working as a trustee for his offshore wealth in 1999.\nIn 2013, Swiss prosecutors opened a criminal investigation into Rifaat al-Assad's role in suppressing the Hama uprising. In 2021 it issued an international arrest warrant for Assad, and in 2024 he was formally charged with war crimes. Assad has always denied these charges. His whereabouts is unknown\nFarrer said Assad's trustees, including Bridges, \"were provided with credible information, when they were appointed and at different junctures thereafter, which fundamentally contradicted the claims being made in the media about Mr al-Assad\".\nThe firm added that it and Bridges were restricted by a duty of client confidentiality from revealing what this evidence was, or commenting on whether it was appropriate for the queen's solicitor to also have represented Assad. However, it did share 11 French defamation judgments, dating from the late 1980s and early 1990s, that found in Assad's favour.\nThe majority related to allegations made in various news outlets that Rifaat al-Assad's wealth was sourced from organised crime. In the case of the two judgments that substantially addressed allegations of human rights abuses, the courts found that the journalists had failed to reflect certain nuances of Amnesty International's report by glossing over uncertainties about whether the Assad regime directly ordered the atrocity.\nPublic attitudes towards British lawyers acting for foreign politicians with questionable reputations have hardened in recent years.\nThis month, a taskforce of senior lawyers and civil society experts said law firms must request more \"credible explanations\" from their clients as to the source of their wealth, and that it was unsustainable to disregard reputational risks to the legal profession.\n\"Whether the same decision [to act for Assad] would be made today, in the light of further information now available and, arguably, the more stringent demands of the regulatory environment, is a point on which one might speculate,\" Farrer said in its response.",
      "ml_hf_summary": "Mark Bridges, a trustee for Rifaat al-Assad, who was charged with war crimes in 2024, served as Queen Elizabeth II's private solicitor from 2002 to 2019.  Bridges managed at least five trusts holding assets for Rifaat al-Assad between 1999 and 2008. These trusts were established on the advice of another law firm and Bridges claims they complied with regulatory requirements at the time. Al-Assad's wealth was amassed through offshore companies and trusts, obscuring his ownership.  Swiss prosecutors opened a criminal investigation into al-Assad in 2013, issuing an international arrest warrant in 2021 and formally charging him with war crimes in 2024.  Al-Assad has denied these charges. Public opinion on British lawyers representing foreign politicians with questionable reputations has hardened recently, prompting calls for greater transparency regarding client wealth sources. \n"

Streeting said past attempts at reform had stumbled because of \"bad politics\".\nTalks were scheduled to open on 26 February but were postponed after ministers said that not all parties could make the meeting. The Lib Dems offered to \"clear our diaries\" to reschedule but said a new date has not yet been proposed.\nHelen Morgan, the Lib Dems' health and social care spokesperson, said: \"If it's taking almost two months and counting to schedule a single meeting, I have serious concerns about the focus at the top of government needed to successfully undertake and implement this review.\n\"Ministers' handling of these cross-party talks smells of a government that has put rescuing social care in the 'too difficult' pile.\n\"Their failure to grasp the nettle means that a review that could have been completed within a year is instead taking three, with ministers risking even longer delays because of their failure to get these talks off the ground.\n\"For years under the Conservatives, [social care] was shamefully neglected, with patients bearing the brunt. Now, the Labour government is taking an approach of kicking the can down the road rather than facing up to the challenges of fixing this broken system.\"\nLady Casey, who was due to join the social care commission this month, was appointed by ministers in mid-January to carry out a three-month report into child sexual abuse grooming gangs. The government has insisted this would not affect her work on the social care commission.\nIt is understood Casey has promised to convene meetings once her work on the grooming gangs report is complete. A government official said the original date and time for the planned meeting had not worked for all invited parties.\nA spokesperson for the Department of Health and Social Care said: \"This government is committed to building national, cross-party consensus to create a fair and affordable adult social care system for all.\n\"This is why the prime minister has asked Baroness Louise Casey to lead an independent commission into adult social care as part of our critical first steps towards building a national care service.\"\nReform of adult social care has been on and off the policy agenda for more than two decades, with attempts by governments of all stripes to overhaul the system repeatedly derailed by political timidity and lack of cross-party consensus.\nSocial care experts criticised the government in January for putting a three-year timescale on changes that they argued could be put in place with a year. They said the issue was not about how to change social care but agreeing what should be done.\nCare providers have urged rapid reform of adult social care, saying the sector faces serious financial problems as a result of the introduction of national insurance and minimum wage rises this month, which have added PS2.8bn to their costs.\nMany have said they face \"tough decisions\" as a result of rising unfunded costs, including handing back unviable care contracts to councils and evicting residents, reducing care quality, laying off staff, reducing their hours or freezing pay.",
      "ml_hf_summary": "The UK government has been accused of delaying action on reforming adult social care.  Following the announcement of plans for a national care service in January, cross-party talks aimed at building consensus have failed to begin after being postponed due to scheduling conflicts. The Liberal Democrats claim this delay is indicative of a lack of commitment from the government and suggests they are prioritizing other issues over addressing the growing social care crisis.  Louise Casey has been appointed to lead an independent commission on adult social care, but her work schedule for the commission is currently unclear.  The government maintains its commitment to building consensus and creating a fair and affordable adult social care system. \n"

In the event that they are unwilling to do so it is my intention to issue high court proceedings. Whilst I have no desire to litigate, I will do what is necessary to ensure my reputation is restored.\"\nReform has been approached for comment.\nAmong other tensions between Lowe and Farage has been the former's notably more hard-right approach towards migration and culture war issues. Lowe regularly uses his large following on X to promise to mass-deport a million-plus migrants, or complain about criminals from \"alien cultures\".\nFarage has criticised such views, although Lowe has a fan in Elon Musk.

I'd say straight away: that's impossible.\" The problem of illegal cattle laundering would also not be resolved in time, said many, while another interviewee said land ownership issues meant quite simply that the deadline was \"impossible\".\nJBS told the Guardian that it contested the conclusions. \"Drawing inferences and conclusions from a limited sample of 30 farmers while disregarding that JBS has over 40,000 registered suppliers is entirely irresponsible,\" the company said in a statement. It said that \"while the sector-wide challenges are significant and larger than any one company can solve on its own, we believe JBS has an in-depth and robust series of integrated policies, systems, and investments that are making a material and positive impact on reducing deforestation risks.\"\nTo hit its targets, JBS needs to register all its direct and indirect suppliers and ensure none of the meat it buys from the Amazon is from cattle that has grazed on deforested land. It has established a network of \"green offices\" to provide free consultation to ranchers on how to comply with the three- to six-month process of regularisation, which involves drawing up a plan to plant more trees, withdrawing from contested territory, or making other environmental remediations. Then details will go into the JBS database, which continually monitors farms using artificial intelligence, and owners will be contacted if they fail to meet their obligations. In Para, the company is also working with the state government on an ear-tagging scheme that would track the state's entire herd of 26 million cattle by 2026.\nThe Para state governor, Helder Barbalho, who has supported the traceability plan, expects JBS to meet its deadline, but he acknowledged there had been resistance and that small farmers in particular would need more support. He said the Bezos Earth Fund had committed 143m reais to this task: \"We are still mobilising resources so that we can finance this policy that is very important for us to present to livestock farmers.\"\nBut ranchers and rancher unions interviewed by the Guardian and its partners said that technical hurdles and uncertainties over land ownership - many ranches were created by invading public land - stood no chance of resolution by the company's self-imposed deadline.\nAdelosmar Antonio Orio, known as Ticao, who works for the Tucumaa-Ourilaandia Union of Rural Producers, said the logistical challenges, such as ranchers needing special equipment including ear trackers and satellite internet systems, would make the scheme impossible to complete before the year-end deadline. \"Not even they [JBS] know how this traceability is going to be implemented,\" he said. Others argued that new small- and medium-sized producers were being asked to bear most of the burden of the new system and that JBS and the government had not done enough to explain the new tracking system and provide the technological support needed to make it work.\nSign up to Down to Earth\nThe planet's most important stories. Get all the week's environment news - the good, the bad and the essential\nafter newsletter promotion\nThe thorny subject of land ownership would also be impossible to resolve, argued many, including Cristina Malcher, the president of the Commission of Women in Agribusiness, a national advocacy body for women in agriculture. \"The deadline of 2025 is impossible to meet, because if you don't know who owns the land, then you don't have environmental regularity,\" Malcher told the Guardian.\nTicao agreed. \"By the end of the year, we need to resolve all the land problems, all the environmental problems.\" Could it be done in time? \"Definitely not,\" he said. His union colleagues expressed similar disbelief that the deadline could be met.\nThe investigation also spoke to indirect suppliers who openly admitted to using middlemen to clean up the environmental record of their livestock, a practice known as cattle laundering. Several producers predicted that a new tracing system would lead to new loopholes, such as slaughtering the cattle elsewhere and then selling the meat - rather than live cattle - at a low price to JBS.\nJBS has not mapped its entire supply chain, due under its deforestation commitments by the end of this year. But the company said: \"JBS has already enrolled the equivalent of over 80% of its annual cattle purchases on to a blockchain-enabled, web-based transparent farming livestock platform.\"\nJBS has previously been linked to deforestation on a number of occasions, and the New York attorney general, Letitia James, filed a lawsuit last year accusing the company of misleading consumers with its climate goals in an effort to increase sales. A bipartisan group of 15 US senators urged the Securities and Exchange Commission to reject JBS's application for a share listing. \"Dozens of journalistic and NGO reports have shown that JBS is linked to more destruction of forests and other ecosystems than any other company in Brazil,\" they wrote in an open letter.\nJBS told the Guardian: \"The challenges of addressing illegal deforestation on cattle operations that span millions of farms across hundreds of thousands of square kilometresare significant.\" It detailed its response, which includes zero tolerance for deforestation sourcing policy, state-of-the-art supply chain monitoring, free technical assistance for producers to help regularise their farms, and the JBS Fund for the Amazon, which finances projects focused on the sustainable development of the Amazon biome.\nThe company also said: \"JBS works with farmers, ranchers and partners across the food system to develop solutions that support a growing global population while optimising resources and reducing agriculture's environmental impact. Cattle raising in the Amazon is undergoing a sectoral transformation, and one company cannot solve all the industry's challenges.\"",
      "ml_hf_summary": "JBS, the world's largest meat company, has been accused of failing to achieve its goal of deforestation-free beef production in the Amazon by 2025.  A recent investigation by journalists from The Guardian, Unearthed and Repórter Brasil found that ranchers and ranching unions believe JBS's claims are unrealistic due to widespread land ownership issues and logistical challenges with implementing traceability systems. Despite JBS's efforts to implement a blockchain-enabled platform for tracking cattle purchases and providing technical assistance to farmers, many argue that the company's self-imposed deadline is impossible to meet.  JBS acknowledges the challenges but emphasizes its commitment to reducing deforestation risks through various initiatives like the JBS Fund for the Amazon and state-level ear-tagging schemes. The investigation highlights the complex issues surrounding cattle production in the Amazon and raises concerns about the sustainability of JBS's efforts. \n"

      "content": "Scientists sound the alarm over substances such as arsenic and lead contaminating soils and entering food systems\nAbout one sixth of global cropland is contaminated by toxic heavy metals, researchers have estimated, with as many as 1.4 billion people living in high-risk areas worldwide.\nApproximately 14 to 17% of cropland globally - roughly 242m hectares - is contaminated by at least one toxic metal such as arsenic, cadmium, cobalt, chromium, copper, nickel or lead, at levels that exceed agricultural and human health safety thresholds.\nThe analysis collected data from more than 1,000 regional studies across the globe, as well as using machine learning technology.\nDr Liz Rylott, a senior lecturer in the department of biology at the University of York, who was not involved in the research, said: \"These findings reveal the deeply worrying extent to which these natural poisons are polluting our soils, entering our food and water, and affecting our health and our environment.\n\"Often collectively called heavy metals, these elements cause a range of devastating health problems, including skin lesions, reduced nerve and organ functions, and cancers.\"\nToxic metal pollution in soil originates from both natural and human activity. Contaminated soil causes significant risks to ecosystems and human health as well as reducing crop yields, jeopardising water quality and food safety owing to bioaccumulation in farm animals. Toxic metal contamination can persist for decades once pollution has been introduced into soil.\nAs demand for critical metals increases, scientists have warned that the heavy metal pollution of soils is likely to worsen. \"Our drive for technology-critical metals to build the green infrastructure required to tackle climate change (wind turbines, electric vehicle batteries and photovoltaic panels) will exacerbate this pollution,\" said Rylott.\nBy combining the data in the study with the global population distribution, researchers estimate that between 900 million and 1.4 billion people live in high-risk areas across the world.\nCadmium was found to be the most widespread toxic metal and was particularly prevalent in south and east Asia, parts of the Middle East and Africa.\n\"This map illustrates how metal pollution is independent of human borders; to tackle this problem, countries will have to work together,\" said Rylott. \"Much of the pollution is in low- and middle-income countries, where communities are directly affected, exacerbating poverty. The effect of these contaminated crops entering global food networks is not as clear.\"",
      "ml_hf_summary": "A study estimates that approximately 1/6th of global cropland is contaminated with toxic heavy metals like arsenic, cadmium, and lead, affecting over 900 million to 1.4 billion people in high-risk areas worldwide.  The contamination originates from both natural and human activities, leading to significant risks to ecosystems, human health, and crop yields. The study found that cadmium was the most prevalent toxic metal, with concentrations highest in south and east Asia, parts of the Middle East, and Africa.  As demand for critical metals increases for green infrastructure projects, scientists predict further worsening of heavy metal pollution in soils. \n"

      "content": "Aix-Marseille University generates interest amid a US crackdown and calls for a 'scientific refugee' status\nNearly 300 academics have applied to a French university's offer to take in US-based researchers rattled by the American government's crackdown on academia, as a former French president called for the creation of a \"scientific refugee\" status for academics in peril.\nEarlier this year, France's Aix-Marseille University was among the first in Europe to respond to the funding freezes, cuts and executive orders unleashed on institutions across the US by Donald Trump's administration.\nWhat they were offering - through a programme titled Safe Place for Science - was a sort of \"scientific asylum\", offering three years of funding at their facility for about 20 researchers.\nOn Thursday the university said it had received 298 applications in a month, of which 242 were deemed eligible. The applicants hailed from institutions such as Johns Hopkins University, Nasa, Columbia, Yale and Stanford, it said in a statement.\nMost of the applications were sent using encrypted messaging, the university's president, Eric Berton, wrote in the French newspaper Liberation. \"And with them came worrying, sometimes chilling, accounts from American researchers about the fate reserved for them by the Trump administration,\" he said.\nMost applicants were experienced researchers in fields that ranged from the humanities to life sciences and the environment, according to the university. Just over half of the eligible applicants, 135, were American, while 45 were dual nationals. More than a dozen French citizens also applied, as did Europeans, Indian nationals and Brazilians.\nThe university said the selection process would start in the coming days, with the aim of allowing researchers to begin arriving in early June.\nFrancois Hollande, a former president of France and a current Socialist MP, recently joined forces with Berton to call for France to recognise embattled researchers from around the world as refugees.\n\"Just like the expression of divergent opinions, their work, which is a source of innovation and knowledge, has become a risk for the propaganda of regimes,\" the pair recently wrote in Liberation.\nAcademics, much like journalists or political opponents, should be able to qualify for protection, they argued. \"Indeed, current asylum mechanisms do not take into account the specificities of the academic environment and the threats facing scientists within authoritarian regimes,\" they wrote. \"This is why we are making an urgent request, one that is appropriate for the current situation: the creation of a 'scientific refugee' status.\"\nOn Monday, Hollande backed his words with legislative action. In a bill tabled in the country's national assembly, he proposed that researchers suffering attacks on their academic freedom be eligible for subsidiary protection - a category reserved for asylum seekers who do not meet the conditions for refugee status but who can demonstrate that they are facing serious threats.\nDoing so would allow for faster and more efficient processing of these researchers, as officials could set out clear eligibility criteria and map out pathways to ensure that they would be able to continue their research.\nHollande described it as an \"obligation\", particularly for researchers working in fields such as the climate crisis. \"If they are interrupted, hindered, prevented, it will be a step backwards for humanity,\" he told the broadcaster France Inter.\nHe described the bill - which must be approved by parliament - as a response to a historic moment. \"It's a symbolic way to show that France is an open country at a time when the United States is closing in on itself and authoritarian regimes are pursuing aggressive, repressive policies,\" he said. \"It's about rediscovering the France of the Enlightenment, the one that in other times was capable of welcoming persecuted researchers from all over the world.\"",
      "ml_hf_summary": "Aix-Marseille University (AMU) has received 298 applications for its \"Safe Place for Science\" program, offering three years of funding to US-based academics impacted by US government restrictions on academia.  The program aims to provide refuge for researchers from institutions like Johns Hopkins and NASA who have faced funding cuts and executive orders under the Trump administration.  AMU has deemed 242 applications eligible, with applicants representing diverse fields and nationalities. The selection process will begin soon, with the goal of allowing researchers to arrive in early June.

Promotional materials for the film suggest these messages \"order him to commit atrocious murders of three other tenants who, in turn, want to kill their next-of-kin\". The film is also described as \"perturbing, livid and hypnotic\".\nGascon's rise to fame and fall from grace provided awards season with one of its most vertiginous fairytales in years. After sharing the best actress award at Cannes with her Emilia Perez co-stars, the newcomer, whose credits until then mostly featured Spanish telenovas, looked set to become the Oscars favourite for her performance as a Mexican cartel leader who transitions while escaping the mob.\nHowever, disquiet among the Mexican and trans communities about their portrayal grew louder as the film's campaign gathered pace, securing a record-breaking 13 nominations. But Gascon's own chance at victory then appeared almost nil after posts on X were resurfaced which expressed controversial opinions about muslims, George Floyd and diversity at the Oscars.\nGascon apologised but was cold-shouldered by Netflix and the film's director, Jacques Audiard, until a U-turn saw her allowed to attend the Oscars - although not to walk the red carpet.\nThe actor spoke out about the vitriol with which she was met during awards season, saying the pain of the subsequent backlash had led her to \"contemplate the unthinkable\". But promoting her memoir a fortnight later, she described herself as \"less racist than Gandhi\" and said \"no one has to forgive me for anything\".\n\"If anyone feels offended by things I may have done in my life,\" she said, \"let them come and tell me.\"\nGallo, 64, is another sometime Cannes favourite and proud non-conformist, whose explicit road trip film The Brown Bunny premiered at the festival in 2003. However, his career has flatlined over the past decade.\nThe actor endorsed Donald Trump's re-election and called him \"the greatest president the USA has ever produced\". Last year it was reported that the actors' union in the US, Sag-Aftra, was investigating after complaints made by three female actors who auditioned for Gallo's most recent film, The Policeman.\nHis personal website advertises his services as an escort, as well as selling vials of his sperm, at $1m apiece.",

AugustoMAs a child, I befriended Michael Meldrum, a local troubadour. He brought me around to his gigs and coffee houses. That was a cool, unique way to grow up, beside this alcoholic artist who hopped from girlfriend to girlfriend's house. He he was smart and so well informed when it came to music.\nI was his shadow between the ages of nine and 13 or 14 or so. Beyond that, we parted ways. So when I was an emancipated minor at 15 and going into the adult world, it was with no protector by my side. I was out there in bars, on my own, running the open mic, playing gigs. I had an after-school job - I was trying to finish high school. I never managed to grow a thick skin; I'm still very open and porous. Somehow I survived all those years without cutting myself off.\nI remember seeing you regularly in London on a Monday night at the Weavers Arms, probably in the early 90s. What brought you to London at that time? KjwillyBack in the day you could get a cheap plane ticket, where you were only supposed to stay for a week and you couldn't bring any luggage. So I went to London, and - shhh, don't tell anybody! - I stayed longer than a week. I started showing up to open mics and making friends. I remember a gig at the Mean Fiddler: a split bill between me and Tori Amos. The audience was loud and rude, and Tori was scolding them, and then I played. That was before either of us were either of us.\nIn America, there was this stereotype of me that the media proliferated again and again: angry, hairy feminist. So that meant only certain people even felt invited to my shows, because the media told them exactly what my music was and who it was for. But when I got to England, there was nobody saying anything about me, so people could find their own way to my songs. The further I got from my stereotype, the more open and free my connection [to the audience] became.\nDoing things like rejecting the major-label system and having a social conscience - and, importantly, acting on it - inspires admiration. Is it me, or is that way of being, and of doing things, dying a death? eamonmccHaving thwarted the music industry and remained independent, I grew a lot. But when I look back, I see a lot of ways in which having a team of creative people around me would have really helped me make decisions. And helped me look good: there's no hair products in my bathroom, you know.\nThese records that I made all on my own are an acquired taste. I'm not an expert recordist, mixer, producer. I have regrets about not doing a lot of my songs justice along the way. It's just a matter of what I can afford, operating on the level that I am. There are sacrifices to being outspoken and political. I've been pushed down and reduced because of my feminism, etc. But anything worthwhile involves sacrifice.\nWhat is the difference between a good song and a great song? InASenseInnocenceA great song is a song that was not meant to be great: it was just meant to be a song. So many people want to make a hit, but to me, that's like pulling yourself out of the water of creation and into calculation. Even worrying about that is a distraction from making real art. I'm just doing what I'm compelled to do in the moment.\nAt a time when women's rights are being eroded at a terrifying pace, what can we do to rise to the challenge and support the young women of today? SJB3288What we can do looks different for each of us. For me, it has looked like writing a lot of songs, and lending my time and energy to movements. For somebody else, it might be bringing a casserole to a neighbour. My whole life I've fantasised about the moment when women across colour, economic and cultural divides reach for each other and model the solution together. I believe it would be the most powerful thing the world has ever seen. Individualism is a mirage.\nSomebody asked me, \"Do you still see yourself as a protest singer?\" And I'm not sure if I ever did, because I don't think that telling somebody they're wrong about something is very effective. More and more, I see my role through my songs as saying to people to my right and to my left: you are here and you matter. Really, the goal of what might on the surface sound like a \"protest song\" is to uplift the people of the world who are trying to do good work; it's to make them feel stronger and more alive.\nI hope that more artists on every level will be putting their butts on the line and getting political, because it couldn't be more urgent. It's a terrifying time for democracy, for women's rights, for the environment, everything. We are in peril on so many levels, so I hope that even artists with a lot to lose will go there. Who would I team up with for an anthem about women's rights? What's Little Simz doing - let's go!\nYou have completed your 23rd album and have been around a while. How do you maintain your creativity when Gertrude Stein, for example, declared that after 26 an artist is through? WoodsDThere's something to that: for a lot of us, what we have to offer, we offer right away. The work that I did [between ages] 18 to 23, that is probably the work that affected my culture the most. But I've made a lot of songs since then. I accept the fact that I'm not the \"it girl\" any more and that's fine. But I am still growing, and passionate about what I do. There is no diminishment of value to women as they age, unless you're working for the approval of the patriarchy. Our energy is being drained and taken from us by these forces that tell us we're not good enough. I find it so sad that people in Hollywood are all trying to play the game with plastic surgery and injections. People accepting who they are, even as they age, is a service to everyone.\nWhat is your most reliable source of creative inspiration? How do you preserve the playfulness and magic in music-making in an industry, and indeed a world, with lots of noise and criticism? April006One of my most reliable sources is other people's art. My favourite thing is to go to a show that makes me want to go home and pick up my guitar and write a song. And my second favourite thing is to be that for somebody else.\nHas being part of the theatre scene, through Persephone [the role she played in the musical Hadestown on Broadway], influenced your art or creative lens? April006It was very humbling in so many ways. I don't know how much more humbling I can take in this life, but to play to an audience that did not show up to see me with love in their heart, on a nightly basis, was eye-opening. I had to lock eyes and sing right to people, and 97% of the time they were giving me the death stare. It was brutal.\nWoody Guthrie wrote \"this machine kills fascists\" on his guitar as a symbol of the power of words and music to fight against oppression. We have a new generation of fascists and a nationalism that is rising worldwide with renewed vigour. You once wrote about \"coming of age during the plague of Reagan and Bush\"; Trump feels like a whole other thing again. How do you think about the role of your music against this new backdrop? benwerdComing of age during the plague of Reagan and Bush, I thought that we could stoop no lower. I was naive - there's always a lower. As a political songwriter, you would love for your tunes to become passe. I wrote a song in 1997 about the plague of gun violence in America. [There were] these songs that I wrote in the George W Bush era, thinking that there was no greater evil to fight ... and now here we are under a Trump regime. It's horrifying to have these 30-year-old songs be more relevant than ever. Being an activist all these years is exhausting. And that's also a very deliberate strategy by these repressive forces: to exhaust us. For me, who's been taking to the streets for 30-plus years, I have to battle this feeling of: does it even matter, if all of the honour is stripped from politics, and the political leaders are just power-hungry oligarchs who don't care?\nAs a young, straight guy in the late 90s with a big love of Fugazi and straight-edge punk, I still found my way in to your music and found both it and your story revelatory and inspiring. I wonder, did you ever have or feel any kinship with those hardcore and very male bands at the time or since? HMKGrey2Absolutely. I love Fugazi and they love me back. I grew up in an era where if you were a woman speaking about your experience, that was, according to many people and the media, only relevant to other women. Any man who was open and brave enough to relate to and hear a woman's experience, they were renegade and rare beasts. I remember having conversations on dressing-room walls, where we wrote to each other - they played the club a week before me, or I did. In the 90s, before social media, if you wanted to send somebody a message, the wall was where you posted.\nI loved hearing how you began by playing gigs at bars, and the way your songs were sometimes influenced by trying to grab the audience's attention. Could you speak a bit more on how you struck out to develop your unique guitar style? April006The dynamics of my music - I use a lot of loud and soft - all come, I think, from the survival skills I learned playing in bars alone, to shut people the hell up! I discovered that if you make a loud sound or hold a note, and then you leave a chasm of silence, people's talking will suddenly hang in the air and they will notice themselves, and then they might even notice you. In that moment, there is a seed of possibility for capturing their attention.\nWhat would you say to your Gen Z fans? The young lesbians still love you! paige004I still love them back. We're still here. Being an old guard now of feminism and the queer movement, us old lesbos or lesbo-adjacent people have things to offer. And I hope that the younger generation want to have us at the table. They are finding their own way, and they very much should, and I have a lot to learn from it. But there are some feminist principles that could help all of our social movements, a lot of wisdom there to be drawn from.\n\"He said, are you an American citizen? I said 'Yes sir, so far'\" - any more or less since you wrote those lyrics? brittunculusMy mother is Canadian, so as of a year or two ago, I did achieve Canadian citizenship, so I'm dual now. When it really is time for me to sit down and leave it to another generation, maybe you'll find me in the woods of Quebec.\n Ani DiFranco's European tour begins 11 June at Royal Albert Hall, London",

      "content": "The highest grossing Black film-maker of all time is known for his superhero movies and reinventing the Rocky franchise. Now he's made his most personal film yet - and it's a vampire thriller\nWe're supposed to be talking about movies, but Ryan Coogler has family on his mind when we have our video call - parents, siblings, twins, ancestors and, most of all, his two children. \"It's all good, kids not up yet,\" the director says in his Oakland drawl. He's speaking from a New York hotel room, the morning after the premiere of his new movie, Sinners. But, sure enough, 10 minutes into our conversation, his five-year-old daughter and three-year-old son come into the room and bundle on to his lap. \"Aw, here's my little ones, bro.\" A toy boomerang flies into and out of shot. \"Daddy's gotta work,\" he patiently explains. Noises off-screen and doors closing.\nAnyway, where were we?\nSinners is Coogler's fifth feature and, despite being a gory period vampire thriller, his most personal. \"I was bringing my whole life to it,\" he says. This is his first original story, after a run that's set him up as one of the most powerful names in cinema. His 2013 debut, Fruitvale Station, chronicled the final day of Oscar Grant, an innocent Black man shot dead by police in Oakland in 2009. It won prizes at Sundance and Cannes and put not only Coogler's name on the map but also that of his regular leading man, Michael B Jordan. After that came Creed (2015), a reinvention of the Rocky franchise that was way better than anyone expected, even earning Sylvester Stallone an Oscar nomination. Then came the cultural phenomenon that was Black Panther (2018), and its tragedy-stricken sequel, Wakanda Forever (2022). Aged just 38, Coogler is the highest grossing Black film-maker ever, which gave him a certain latitude.\nSinners is set in 1930s Mississippi, close to where his own family originated before moving to California, he explains. The narrative weaves in the recent history of the era: slavery, reconstruction, the first world war; abject rural poverty; the Ku Klux Klan; Christian and African spiritualism; and the birth of the blues. \"I've been struggling to tell a story that does the great migration for a while,\" he says. \"It's a personal obsession of mine, this period of time when Black people were considering leaving the south en masse.\" He had already been interviewing remaining members of the \"silent generation\" for several years, he says, including his own family. The blues element comes from his uncle, who grew up in Mississippi and died in 2015. \"We were really close, and he would always listen to blues records - it was his only form of entertainment. I would find myself listening to blues records to remember him. That's how I got inspired to explore and research, and that's how I got to this movie.\" He's mindful of his own place in this family history, he says. \"So it's me growing and dealing with my own position, my own mortality.\"\nHe's talking as if he's just made a historical documentary, but Sinners is a full-throttle action movie, taking in bloody violence, supernatural mayhem and some rousing musical numbers. Anchoring it all is Jordan in double gangster mode, playing twin brothers Smoke and Stack, who return from Chicago with plans to set up a \"juke joint\" on the edge of town. Opening night does not go as planned.\nThis is Coogler's gift as a film-maker: his movies are deep and soulful but also crowd-pleasing and spectacular. It's a rarity in today's movie landscape, and Coogler comes across as a sincere and thoughtful artist.\nAs to how he manages to make cinema that's entertaining but not dumb, though, his explanation is simple: \"We're, like, real movie people,\" he says. He's talking about himself and his wife, Zinzi, who is his co-producer. \"We grew up going to the movies. We all got kids now but we still end up going, even when we're busy, at least once a week.\"\nWhen he talks about films, he's talking about family, and vice versa. He really did grow up with the movies: \"It's been in my blood for at least two generations.\" He remembers his father taking him to his first cinema when he was five. His father was in his early 20s, doing odd jobs in Oakland, which was still very working class (he later became a probation counsellor; his mother is a community organiser). The movie was John Singleton's 1991 classic Boyz n the Hood: \"He'd heard it was a good movie for Black fathers and sons.\" This is the kind of movie Coogler has sought to make, he says: \"about a specific American experience, but it translates - everybody gets that movie.\" His father took him back the next year to see Spike Lee's Malcolm X (1992). He's proud that he'll be screening Sinners in the same cinema next week.\nCoogler also remembers his first date with Zinzi, when they were still in high school together: they went to see the teen comedy Bring It On (2000). When he interviewed his grandmother (from southern Texas) as research for Sinners, she told him his grandfather (who hailed from Mississippi) had done the same: \"He took her to the movies and tried to make out with her. And she told him: 'Hey, we can do that after the movie. I'm trying to watch this.'\"\nThe twins element of Sinners is also close to Coogler's own experience. He speaks of the history of twins being othered and mythologised, of the twin deities in the Yoruba culture of his ancestors, and how West Africa still has the highest rate of twin births in the world. But he also speaks of his twin aunts, one of whom is his godmother. \"We could tell my aunts apart easily, but they're completely identical. They live next door to each other to this day.\" He also confesses: \"I dated these girls that were identical twins when I was in summer camp. But not at the same time, bro!\" He was only 10 years old, so it was all innocent, he hastens to add. \"But these girls were cute, man - everybody wanted to be with them.\"\nAs for directing two Michael B Jordans, Coogler modestly credits his leading man for differentiating the two characters (Smoke is tough and serious; Stack more easygoing and dandyish). Coogler just took care of the technical stuff, he says. The twins theme fits with the dichotomies of the story - good and evil; the blues and the church; day and night - but it was also a way to refresh his long relationship with Jordan, who has not only featured in all of Coogler's movies so far, but also directed Creed 3, which Coogler co-wrote and co-produced.\n\"He's an incredibly kind man, a humble man, generous, but he does have a raging ambition within him,\" Coogler says of Jordan. \"If you can offer him something that he hasn't done before, that, on the surface, is a challenge, you have a better chance of getting his interest - especially with me, because we've done so much together.\" He wouldn't describe their relationship as brotherly, but they are like the twins in the movie: \"Mike is very like Stack, in terms of his ambition. He's a wild dreamer. He comes up with incredible ideas and concepts, and oftentimes I'm like: 'Bro, that's impossible.' So we make a good pairing.\"\nDespite the setting, it is tempting to view Sinners as a commentary on the present day. This is, in essence, a story about Black folks trying to build something of their own, and white folks coming in to try to tear it down (the movie's chief antagonists are a sinister Irish folk trio, led by Jack O'Connell). At that level it's a story that reflects its era, not least incidents like the Tulsa massacre in 1921, where a whole Black neighbourhood was razed to the ground by white people. But it could also speak to a modern-day America, where DEI provisions are being rolled back by the Trump administration, Black history is being erased, qualified Black professionals are being fired and white supremacy is apparently back.\nIn 2022, Coogler was handcuffed and detained at a bank in Atlanta, assumed to be a bank robber, when he was simply trying to withdraw his own money. The issue was quickly resolved, and Coogler would rather not talk about it today, he says.\nAnd as for parallels with the present day, \"any direct ties with what's happening right now are, like, totally coincidental, or ironic\", he says. He wrote the story in 2023. \"I definitely couldn't have predicted what's happened in our politics in the last few months. I wish I was that smart.\"\nIn a way, though, Coogler's career stands in direct opposition to the forces now trying to tear American progress down. Fruitvale Station anticipated the Black Lives Matter protests of 2020. Now, that movement is in retreat, as the culture war has spread into entertainment: movies that give more space to women or people of colour are routinely piled upon by white so-called fans. Major franchises such as Star Wars, Marvel movies and Disney princess movies have all experienced this.\nBut if there was ever any credibility to the \"Go woke, go broke\" maxim, Coogler's work provides the perfect riposte - particularly his Creed and Black Panther movies, all of which have been hugely successful. Black Panther in particular will be remembered as an extraordinary flowering of Black creativity, in its utopian Afrofuturism, its celebration of African culture and its gathering of talents on screen and off, from the all-star cast, to Oscar-winning costume designer Ruth E Carter, to Kendrick Lamar, The Weeknd and SZA on the soundtrack. It's no exaggeration to describe it as a cultural moment, on a par with Coogler's formative movie experiences Boyz n the Hood and Malcolm X.\nMaking the sequel was much harder, he says, in the face of the Covid pandemic and the death of Black Panther himself, Chadwick Boseman, of colon cancer in 2020. It was a time of \"complicated grief\", he says, and the Black Panther team took it like a loss in the family. They got through it by working. \"Sometimes it's actually a relief having something to do, so you can't sit in that terrible feeling ... After we put the movie out, my heart broke almost even more, because I realised all the work had been distracting me from the fact that Chad's not going to make any more movies.\"\nConscious as he is of his identity and heritage, Coogler never set out to make films only for Black audiences. He pushes back on my suggestion that Sinners is simply about white folks tearing down what Black folks have built. It's more complicated than that, he says. The story also includes Chinese American and Native American characters, and O'Connell's character is marked by his own history of colonisation back home in Ireland: \"I think he has knowledge of what's really coming for these people.\"\nCoogler has no axe to grind against Irish folk music, he insists. Quite the opposite, in fact: \"Black people love that shit, bro! It's almost the world's best-kept secret how much we love that music and that culture.\"\nMusic is the key to Sinners, and, he suggests, to the history of multicultural America. \"You realise that 'genre' was a totally racist invention,\" he says. In the 1920s, white-owned labels began to market blues, jazz and gospel music to Black consumers as \"race records\", he explains, \"and they built different genres off that. So it's like, I sing a song, then you sing a song and now they're different genres? That's fucking crazy.\"\nCoogler calls blues music \"the most important contribution America has made to global culture ... because it's so true, it's so pure that it works for everybody. And to me, that is fascinating - that people living under that type of societal situation can make something that had that transcendental impact.\"\nThere's a memorable musical scene in Sinners where singer Miles Caton's blues performance literally tears the roof off the joint and rips through the fabric of space and time, bringing together African tribal musicians, Funkadelic-style electric guitarists, even Chinese dragon dancers. This frenzied melting pot of musical styles and cultures is perhaps closer to the real America, or at least how Coogler sees it.\nThere's just time to ask about Black Panther 3. Rumours have been circulating. Denzel Washington apparently let slip Coogler was writing a role for him in it. Letitia Wright's Shuri, who inherited the Black Panther mantle in Wakanda Forever, is set to figure in Marvel's next Avengers team-up. There's also a spin-off Eyes of Wakanda miniseries on the cards. Is it going to happen?\n\"I certainly hope so - I love all those guys over there,\" he says. But then his children come back into the room. \"They've come to collect me, bro,\" he laughs, as they pull him away. He's kept them waiting long enough. Movie time is over; now it's family time.\n Sinners is in cinemas from 18 April",

      "content": "(Matador)The two deep south songwriters ditch country's rhinestones for a personal, defiant reframing of the genre's tropes\nThe origins of Send a Prayer My Way stretch back nearly a decade. The partnership between US singer-songwriters Mackenzie \"Torres\" Scott and Julien Baker germinated in 2016, when the pair performed together in Chicago. Scott subsequently suggested, in a text sent during the pandemic, that they make a country album. Accusations that the pair are jumping on an ongoing trend for high-profile pivots towards a Nashville-oriented sound - which has so far involved the likes of Beyonce, Post Malone, Zayn Malik, Chappell Roan and Lana Del Rey - are thus diffused.\nNevertheless, it still feels telling that Send a Prayer My Way arrives now. Baker has spent much of the 2020s as one-third of Boygenius, a collaboration with Lucy Dacus and Phoebe Bridgers that made her far more famous than her previous solo albums. It spiralled into something that resembled a genuine pop phenomenon, laden with awards and headlining Madison Square Garden and the Hollywood Bowl.\nSend a Prayer My Way, however, feels like a deliberate shift towards something more intimate and, perhaps, manageable. This is resolutely not the kind of 21st-century country that arrives, metaphorically, sporting a pink sequined cowboy hat, built to wind up on Spotify's Neon Cowgirl playlist alongside Sabrina Carpenter and Shania Twain. Instead, its closest peer may be 2016's self-titled collaborative album by Neko Case, kd lang and Laura Veirs. Its tasteful arrangements - big on softly weeping pedal steel and fiddle, occasional muted organ - and mid-to-slow tempos cleave to the less poppy and voguish sound of alt-country: when Tape Runs Out reaches a rocky crescendo, it feels closer to the realm of rootsy Americana than Nashville's Music Row.\nThe distinct lack of rhinestones makes sense: like Dacus's recent Forever Is a Feeling - an album largely concerned itself with tracing the arc of Dacus and Baker's romantic relationship - it's explicitly rooted in the personal. Baker and Scott hail from America's deep south - the former from Tennessee, the latter from Georgia - where, as Baker put it, you \"couldn't escape\" country music. Both are also gay, and the country scene of their youth was not exactly welcoming or inclusive.\nSend a Prayer My Way's same-sex love songs and stark explorations of growing up in an environment freighted with religious bigotry feel less groundbreaking in the era of fellow queer country acts Orville Peck and Brandi Carlile than they once might have done. But they're still marked by an affecting sense of personal reclamation, of two expat Southerners looking back at a genre they rejected in their youth and finding a place for themselves. \"In my book there's no such thing as a guilty pleasure / As long as your pleasure's not unkind,\" the pair sing in harmony on The Only Marble I've Got Left.\nThe pair sharply reframe standard country songwriting tropes such as weeping into your beer and/or starting a bar fight on Bottom of the Bottle, and Sylvia's inveterate wanderer bidding farewell before taking to the open road. It can sound samey: the sweetly upbeat single Sugar in the Tank is an outlier, and Send a Prayer My Way could perhaps have done with at least one more track like it. That said, there's real power in its combination of low-key musical delights - most notably the sound of Baker and Scott's voices together, the former high and plaintive, the latter deeper and darker in tone - and lyrics that can deliver an emotional sucker punch.\nSign up to Sleeve Notes\nGet music news, bold reviews and unexpected extras. Every genre, every era, every week\nafter newsletter promotion\nTuesday details a young romance derailed by a combination of parental homophobia and internalised shame: \"Instead of backing me up / Tuesday melted right down / Asked me to write her mother / To emphasise how much I loved Jesus and men / How I wish that I hadn't,\" Torres sings. The saga devolves into self-harm, religious doubt and regret: the song's brilliance lies not just in its unflinching retelling, but the fact it choses to spike its conclusion with wit. \"One more thing: if you ever hear this song / Tell your momma she can go suck an egg,\" Torres sings, softly.\nSomething of that line's quiet defiance runs right through Send a Prayer My Way, an album that seems intent on doing things its own way, regardless of commercial expectation or trends of the genre. It's beautifully made and gently powerful - a reminder that understated pleasures are pleasures all the same.\nKokoroko - Sweetie\n From Kokoroko's forthcoming second album, Sweetie splits the difference between jazz, Afrobeat and soul in an entirely delightful way: very summery, very London.",
      "ml_hf_summary": "\"Send a Prayer My Way,\" a collaborative album by US singer-songwriters Mackenzie \"Torres\" Scott and Julien Baker, was released. The album features a stripped-down sound reminiscent of alt-country artists like Neko Case and kd lang, with minimal instrumentation and slower tempos.

Baker and Scott's distinct voices blend together to create an intimate and powerful listening experience. The album challenges traditional country tropes by focusing on emotional honesty and self-expression rather than relying on stereotypical imagery or musical conventions. \n"

      "content": "You have every right to be upset, writes advice columnist Eleanor Gordon-Smith, but you should start by finding out why he felt the need to hide this\nMy husband completely covered up the fact that he retired two years ago and has been pretending to go to work ever since. He made up stories about work events. I only found out by seeing the pension payments into our joint account. He is 68 and has reapplied on spec to his old company. He hasn't had any response but continues to wait for one.\nWhen asked about what he does, he says he sits in cafes and does crossword puzzles. He is always on his phone. He delays and denies talking about being on the pension and any activities such as volunteering, doing courses etc. How can I reboot open communication?Eleanor says: Oh this makes me sad for you both. It reminds me of people in the Depression who got laid off and didn't tell their families, just took their lunch in the paper bag and sat on a park bench.\nObviously he's deceived you, and that's got to feel bad - you might well be quite angry. As well as the surprise discovery that he's retired, there's the equally tough surprise that, for reasons totally opaque to you, he didn't want or feel able to say so.\nThat's a drastic thing to learn about your communicative environment! This was a big deception. It's not as obviously explicable as, say, a lie to get out of trouble. And it doesn't even sound as if he's scrambling to explain things now that he's been discovered; you said he still blocks efforts to talk about the pension. I think you're right to feel communication needs a hard reboot.\nMy question (and I imagine yours) is: what did he want or need that made lying feel like the best way to get it? It might help to start there by quite literally just listening. The listening phase of acknowledging each other in relationships is very different from the adjudication phase, and different again from the fixing and improving phase. You mentioned a number of things from the latter camps - he doesn't want to talk about classes, activities, courses, he's delaying and denying. Separate and before that, there's a task of understanding: why didn't he want to share this? \n I wonder if it might help to quarantine the questions of \"what now\" and \"who's right\", and focus on seeing if you can learn why he didn't want to share this. I'm thinking of old school listening techniques like saying his point back to him, seeing if you can accurately sum up why such-and-such is important to him. You might be surprised by how illuminating this can be.\nYou think you're saying back exactly what the other person just said, then they'll say no, it's not quite that, it's this instead. Mutual chipping away gets you closer to proper understanding.\nI know that's a lot of work to put on you, and it means temporarily setting aside legitimate criticisms. But the pragmatics of communication often come apart from the morality of adjudication. You're in a position now where something in him feels that talking isn't worth it. I'm not saying that's right - it might not be. It might be wildly unfair. But if it's to change, he needs to get the sense that talking might produce different results than the ones he's expecting. One way to do that is to just keep saying: this has revealed something really weird in our communication and I hope it can be different.\nIf he fights you on even that, you could tell him how this makes you feel - lonely, like he doesn't trust you with things that are important to him. That way, continuing to not talk isn't just framed as his preference. It makes it clear that, by clamming up, he's actively continuing to do something that hurts you.",
      "ml_hf_summary": "A husband concealed his retirement for two years and has been pretending to work. He made up stories about his activities and delayed discussing the pension or volunteering. The wife discovered this through pension payments and is seeking to reboot communication with her husband.  She suggests focusing on understanding why he chose to lie, starting with a listening phase where she attempts to accurately summarize his perspective. This approach aims to uncover the underlying reasons for his deception and potentially pave the way for more open communication. \n"

      "content": "From the rock sea-spurrey, which appears to grow out of solid rock, to the slender centaury that lives on a landslip, these plants exist where they do for good reason\nI first encountered coastal wildflowers when I was 11. I was visiting my grandmother's friend in Devon and a lady said: \"Here, dear,\" and dug up a clump of Warren crocuses - a rare plant that, at the time, was only thought to grow in the seaside resort of Dawlish Warren. She gave them to me to grow in my garden at home. But of course they didn't grow away from the sea.\nThat was when I realised there was something special about coastal wildflowers. They fascinate me because, as well as being beautiful flowers, they often grow in tough locations. Take the rock sea-spurrey: a delicate little plant that appears to grow out of solid rock, such as a crevice in a cliff base. It can put up with being splashed with sea spray and baked by the summer sun. And yet it seems to thrive in that difficult, harsh environment.\nThere's even one plant - the slender centaury - that lives on a landslip, which is a dangerous place to live. The only place you can find it is on the cliffs of Dorset on the Jurassic Coast, which are always falling into the sea. Yet somehow it manages to survive.\nOther plants, such as eelgrass, thrive in salt marshes: squelchy, muddy places where you wouldn't want to walk without risking your life. The tide comes in gradually and creates conditions that most plants couldn't cope with because the salty water would dehydrate them.\nEelgrass, which makes beaches look like grassy meadows, can actually grow entirely submerged in seawater. That means it can stabilise the sand and create a good, safe habitat for marine life, like seahorses. It also stores a lot more carbon than many terrestrial plants.\nOther salt marsh plants like cordgrasses are good at protecting low lying areas of our coastline: by creating a tangle of roots and emergent stems, they trap silt and mud, and that slows the advance of the waves breaking on the shore.\nWithout these plants, which support large numbers of invertebrates that birds and fish rely on, the waves would sweep the mud and sand away during a high tide or rough weather. The waves would then come pounding on the shore, potentially damaging sea walls and pushing the coast farther inland.\nOne of the most spectacular coastal wildflowers to see is the thrift, also known as the sea pink, which covers cliffs with pink flowers at the end of May. Another is the yellow horned poppy, a bright yellow poppy that grows on shingle beaches. It's amazing to see it growing there, where there can't really be any soil. I'm also a big fan of rock sea-lavender, which lives on cliffs all along the coast, and lasts long after other plants have died back.\nSome Mediterranean coastal plants have now got a foothold on the south coast of Britain, such as the sea daffodil, a fragrant white flower. As the climate changes, there is a risk that non-native coastal flowers may become more aggressive and crowd out our native species. However, my greatest fear for the future is people not appreciating our coastal wildflowers and thinking: \"we can build a harbour here or put a caravan park there, and the plants can go and live somewhere else.\"\nThose plants are often in a particular place for a good reason. That's the habitat that really suits them. Once these flowers are lost, they will be lost for ever.\n Andrew Cleave is the co-author of Coastal Wildflowers of Britain, Ireland and Northwest Europe: A Field Guide (Princeton University Press, PS20). As told to Donna Ferguson",
      "ml_hf_summary": "Coastal wildflowers thrive in challenging environments due to their adaptation to harsh conditions like salt spray, strong winds, and unstable terrain.  Examples include the rock sea-spurrey, which grows on cliffs, and the slender centaury, which survives on landslips.  Eelgrass thrives in salt marshes, providing habitat for marine life and storing carbon. Cordgrasses protect low-lying coastal areas by trapping silt and mud. These plants are vital to maintaining healthy coastlines as they support invertebrates that birds and fish rely upon. The article highlights the importance of appreciating these unique wildflowers and their ecological roles, emphasizing the potential consequences of losing them due to human development. \n"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link. Learn more.\nThe 19th century undergarment has been thrust into the 21st century spotlight with a string of celebrities and influencers channelling their inner Folie Bergere dancer - including the actor Lily James, Alexa Chung and Camille Charriere. Social media is peppered with gen Z and millennials styling Victorian bloomers, found on vintage sites or on the high street with band T-shirts, crop tops and cardigans. Free People's PS88 \"forever young pants\", which come in six different colours and are bedecked in a dramatic lace trim, are proving particularly popular.\nBut it is worth noting that not all the garments being touted as bloomers are in fact technically bloomers. The term has also become incorrectly interchangeable with pantaloons (18th century billowing shaped trousers typically fastened around the calf). In 2025, anything with a vaguely balloon-like shape, or featuring lace trimming at the hem, is being lumped together. Retailers such as ASOS and Urban Outfitters are selling pairs of \"micro bloomer shorts\", while Alaia has a pair of bloomer adjacent trousers for PS1,560.\nChemena Kamali, the creative director of Chloe, could be hailed as the catalyst behind the revival. Her spring/summer '25 show last September featured several bloomers, in sheer lace and apricot silk-charmeuse tied around the ankle or tapered at the knee. Vogue described the look as having \"the potential to reshape how young women think about sexy dressing in 2025.\"\n\"They have an effortless charm and a playfulness to them, while being one of the most comfortable items in your wardrobe,\" says Flora Sharp, director of Flora Mae, a London-based brand that handcrafts garments based on historical references using repurposed fabrics. Over the past year her 'Verona' bloomers have become the most popular item on her site. Her customers span New York to London, are aged between 18-34 and have, as Sharp describes, a \"strong interest in fashion history and sustainability.\"\nThat history charts the genesis of bloomers back to Amelia Bloomer, a New York born suffragist who, during the 1850s, inspired women to free themselves from tight-fitting corsets and crinolines and instead wear shortened dresses over Turkish-style pantaloons. In 1851, American suffragists drew international attention to the style when they wore bloomers to the World's Peace Congress in London. It sparked wide backlash, with \"Bloomerites\" harassed and arrested on the street. Bloomer later reflected that the fury surrounding them was symbolic, it hinted at the larger-scale \"usurpation of the rights of man.\"\nWhile other historical garments, including corsets and even chainmail, have re-emerged as modern trends, Sharp says bloomers are the first to have \"an element of comfortability.\" Her PS65 versions are based on original Victorian designs but adapted for today. \"Antique examples often have an impractical 'split leg' feature, are unrealistically small at the waist, and can be made of very fine cotton, making them see-through.\" Using vintage cotton, Sharp adds an elasticated waist and an adjustable drawstring bow detail around the ankles in order to fit a wider range of bodies.\nFans seem to enjoy their versatility. Sharp says that they appeal to people \"increasingly drawn to experimental and subversive styling\". They have \"the potential to be layered in different ways, peeking from underneath a skirt as they may have been worn in the 19th century, or as a statement piece on their own.\" One thing to consider before donning the bloomer?

Celebrities like Lily James and Alexa Chung have been seen sporting them, and retailers such as Free People and ASOS offer various styles. The trend is attributed to Chemena Kamali's inclusion of bloomers in her Chloé spring/summer 2025 collection.

It sits between the base-model PS329 iPad A16 and the PS999 iPad Pro M4, splitting the difference in price and features.\nNothing has changed on the outside of the tablet. The M3 model is a straight replacement for the M2 model, featuring the same crisp screen, sleek aluminium design and Touch ID fingerprint scanner in the power button.\nThe Centre Stage webcam at the top of the screen makes video calls a breeze by automatically panning and scanning to keep you and your family in frame. Stereo speakers make watching TV and films great, while support for the PS129 Apple Pencil Pro makes doodling or taking notes a joy.\nScreen: 11in or 13in Liquid Retina display (264ppi)\nProcessor: Apple M3 (9-core GPU)\nRAM: 8GB\nStorage: 128, 256, 512GB or 1TB\nOperating system: iPadOS 18.4\nCamera: 12MP rear, 12MP centre stage\nConnectivity: Wifi 6E (5G optional eSim-only), Bluetooth 5.3, USB-C, Touch ID, Smart Connecter\nDimensions: 247.6 x 178.5 x 6.1mm or 280.6 x 214.9 x 6.1mm\nWeight: 460g or 616g\nThe big change for the new Air is an upgrade to the Apple M3 chip, which was first seen in late 2023 in the MacBook Pro and was successfully used in the MacBook Air until March when it was replaced with the M4 chip.\nWhile the M3 isn't Apple's latest chip, it is still far more powerful than most will ever need in a tablet and much faster than the competition. It is about 10-20% quicker than the outgoing M2 model in tests and will make short work of games and even pro-level apps such as Affinity Photo, Procreate or Adobe Lightroom.\nCombined with a reliable battery life of nine to 10 hours, it can easily be used as a laptop replacement when equipped with accessories such as the new version of Apple's excellent Magic Keyboard case, although that comes at great cost at PS269. Cheaper third-party options from Logitech and others are available, however.\nThe iPad Air runs iPadOS 18.4, which includes a collection of multitasking tools, and can be plugged into an external monitor such as a laptop via the USB-C port. But the M3 chip also enables various Apple Intelligence features, which are not available on the standard iPad A16. These include several AI image editing and generation tools, writing and proofreading tools, ChatGPT integration into Siri and other bits.\nApple says the battery should last in excess of 1,000 full charge cycles with at least 80% of its original capacity, and can be replaced from PS115. The tablet is generally repairable, with a damaged out-of-warranty repair costing from PS429.\nThe tablet contains at least 30% recycled content, including aluminium, cobalt, copper, glass, gold, lithium, plastic, rare earth elements and tin. Apple breaks down the tablet's environmental impact in its report and offers trade-in and free recycling schemes, including for non-Apple products.\nThe 11in iPad Air M3 costs from PS599 (EUR699/$599/A$999) and the 13in iPad Air M3 costs from PS799 (EUR949/$799/A$1,349).\nFor comparison, the iPad A16 costs from PS329, the iPad Pro M4 costs from PS999 and the Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 FE costs from PS499. The MacBook Air M4 starts at PS999.\nThe iPad Air M3 is a great premium tablet that makes for an excellent upgrade over the base model Apple tablet.\nIt is a highly capable machine with laptop-level power, long battery life, a quality screen and plenty of accessories to turn it into a drawing tablet, computer replacement or many other tools. The choice of sizes balances nicely between portability at the 11in and the big-screen utility of the 13in version.\nBut the M3 model isn't an upgrade worth making over recent iPad Air versions, and if all you do is watch TV or films on it, the standard iPad A16 does the job for much less. Meanwhile, the top-end iPad Pro M4 beats the Air on all counts but costs an awful lot more.\nSo for those looking for a premium do-it-all tablet, the iPad Air M3 is hard to beat.\nPros: choice of sizes, laptop-level M3 performance, solid battery life, quality screen, USB-C, long software support life, large range of apps and accessories, good speakers, landscape Centre Stage camera, recycled aluminium.\nCons: expensive, no multiuser support, iPadOS still needs work as a laptop replacement, no kickstand without case, no Face ID, 60Hz screen.",

The last column covered how to protect your phone and data privacy at the US border. If you'd like to skip to a section about a particular tip, click the \"Jump to\" menu at the top of this article.\nAt the press of a button, your Tesla pulls itself out of parking spot with no one behind the wheel using a feature called Summon. It drives itself on highways using Autopilot. When you arrive at your destination, it can record nearby activity while parked with a feature called Sentry Mode.\nTo effectively operate any of these features, your car needs to monitor and collect a large amount of data about you. Most Tesla vehicles come equipped with nine internal and external cameras. Information from your Tesla, delivered via location trackers, sensors and more, can paint an intricate picture of your life and movement.\n\"Teslas are truly rolling surveillance platforms,\" said John Davisson, a senior counsel and director of litigation at digital rights research group Electronic Privacy Information Center. \"There are some privacy safeguards that Tesla offers that at least allow you, on the face of the settings, to opt out of data sharing ... provided that Tesla is actually following through on those commitments.\"\nTesla isn't alone in collecting a considerable amount of data to enable a suite of advanced features on your vehicle. Any connected car collects some level of information to operate. Some Tesla owners are newly concerned, given CEO Elon Musk's role in Donald Trump's administration.\nThose concerns are not entirely unfounded, according to Reem Suleiman, the director of advocacy at Mozilla Foundation, which gave Tesla a \"privacy not included\" grade in its assessment of the carmaker's data security practices. For one, the company's track record of protecting user data is shaky. In 2023, a Reuters investigation found that employees were sharing sensitive footage that vehicles captured in internal messaging forums. A Washington Post analysis of transparency reports published by Twitter and then X after Musk took over likewise showed that X acquiesced to 20% more government requests to remove content in just the first half of 2024 than Twitter did in all of 2021 - the last time the company published the transparency report.\nWe spoke to privacy experts, consulted Tesla's privacy policy and even asked Tesla's own AI chatbot how to share the least amount of data with Tesla as possible. If you own a Tesla, there are some precautions you can and, in many cases, should take with regards to your vehicle. But be forewarned: adjusting these settings so that you share the least possible amount of data with Tesla will shut off access to many of your car's functions.\n\"They pretty much say that, if you choose to opt out of data collection, then your car is essentially a lemon,\" Suleiman said. \"They essentially say that your vehicle can have reduced functionality, serious damage or inoperability. So it's kind of a non-choice, when you think about it.\"\nHere's what you need to know about your privacy in Tesla vehicles:\nTesla's privacy policy details a wide swath of data that its vehicles collect - most of which is stored locally but is also sent to the company unless you change your settings.\nAccording to Tesla's AI chatbot, information collected on you includes: \"location data (although Tesla doesn't record or store vehicle-specific GPS information, except in the case of a crash); driving habits and behaviors (such as speed, braking patterns, and acceleration); diagnostic and vehicle usage data (to help improve Tesla's products and services); infotainment system data (like browsing history and voice commands) and Autopilot data (camera recordings, sensor readings, and other inputs to support advanced safety features)\".\nThe good news is that data can be collected and stored on your vehicle's local drives if opt out of sharing information with the company. The bad news is that data can still be accessed if law enforcement somehow gets a hold of your vehicle during a traffic stop or other circumstance, according to the Electronic Privacy Information Center's Davisson.\nAnd it's not just your car that's collecting information. The Tesla mobile app, from which you can activate Sentry Mode or Summon, also collects location, contact, browsing and device information. Read on for how to dial back how much your car monitors you.\nIf you opt to share your data with Tesla, all of the data it collects on you may be shared with third parties, including law enforcement. According to the company's privacy policy, in addition to sharing data with law enforcement when the company receives a valid court order, Tesla will also share data when it is \"essential to protect national security or public safety\". Davisson says that language is vague and opens the door for video footage to be shared with law enforcement for any number of reasons. Recently, for instance, the FBI has categorized vandalism of Tesla vehicles and showrooms as \"domestic terrorism\".\n\"Especially now, when everything is apparently a national emergency, it's a very short hop from that to considering immigration enforcement to be a safety issue that requires constant sharing of real-time footage to Ice or other law enforcement officials,\" said Davisson. \"And it's a scary situation.\"\nSo how do you protect your data?\nEveryone has a different risk profile when it comes to their privacy. Some people may be more concerned than others about who is gaining access to their personal information. It's not just your own privacy you need to be cognizant of, however, as Tesla's exterior cameras can collect footage of people around the vehicle as well.\nIf you are concerned about information gathering and don't already have a Tesla, privacy experts say you should opt for a different car. If you do have one and want to reclaim your privacy, sell it. Even Tesla's AI chatbot gave similar advice.\n\"If someone is deeply concerned about their privacy, they might consider alternatives, such as: 1 Opting for a vehicle manufacturer with more restrictive data collection practices (though this might come at the cost of reduced convenience features); 2 Exploring aftermarket solutions or modifications that could potentially reduce data sharing (though this might void warranties or introduce compatibility issues).\"\nSign up to TechScape\nA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our lives\nafter newsletter promotion\nSo you've already bought a Tesla, and you've decided to sell it. Suleiman and the Mozilla Foundation highly recommend factory-resetting the car before you do. That means your car will be wiped of all of its data as if it was just coming off the lot.\n\"Just because you sell your car off doesn't mean that you've scrubbed the data,\" Suleiman said. \"It requires a little bit of due diligence.\"\nSo before you take the vehicle off your Tesla account, you will need to factory-reset your car from your in-car settings. Sit in the driver's seat and follow these steps:\n1 Go to Controls > Service > Factory Reset.\n2 Enter your Tesla account username and password to verify your credentials.\n3 Confirm that you want to perform a factory reset.\n\"This will erase all personal data, including saved addresses, music favorites and imported contacts, and restore your car's settings to their factory defaults,\" according to Tesla's AI chatbot. The company also recommends deleting your \"HomeLink\" devices - which can allow you to control things like your garage door, lights or home security system from your Tesla. Do that by clicking on the \"HomeLink\" icon at the top of the \"Controls\" screen then going to HomeLink settings, where you can remove connections to other devices.\nIn the settings of your vehicle and the Tesla app, you can opt not to share your data with the company. But as we've said before, be prepared to lose some functionality of your car.\nOpting out of data-sharing in your car is fairly straightforward. In your vehicle, go to Settings > Software > Data sharing. Turn off \"allow data sharing\". This will disable the sharing of analytics, road segment, diagnostic and vehicle usage data. Tesla's AI chatbot also recommended turning off \"allow Autopilot analytics\" to stop sharing Autopilot-related data.\nOpt out of mobile app location and data sharing. In the Tesla app, go to Settings (the button will either look like three horizontal lines or a gear icon). Then scroll down to Security and Privacy. Then select turn off Location Services. Click Turn off Analytics to stop sharing app usage data to the company. Then revoke access to your camera, microphone and contacts.\n\"By following these steps, you'll be sharing the least amount of data with Tesla while still enjoying the core features and functionalities of your vehicle and mobile app,\" according to the Tesla AI chatbot.\nBut this will affect the functionality of your car. According to Tesla's chatbot, data sharing will affect these features:\n\"Remote vehicle monitoring and control through the mobile app (eg, checking your vehicle's status, location, and surroundings); navigation and routing optimization (although basic navigation will still work); geofencing and smart preconditioning (your vehicle won't be able to anticipate your arrival or departure); some Autopilot features, such as traffic-aware cruise control and automatic emergency braking, may not function optimally; over-the-air software updates might be delayed or unavailable; certain advanced safety features, like Emergency Services, may not work seamlessly.\"\n\"I don't think it should be a trade-off,\" Davisson said. \"It is true that some of the collision avoidance systems and autonomous features on Teslas like other vehicles do rely on data collection and cameras. But it should not come at the cost of the privacy, certainly of the driver or passengers of the vehicle or for people that happen to be in the area surrounding the vehicle.\"",

      "content": "Illegally diverted rivers, seawater and poorly managed building projects have polluted the Cienaga Grande de Santa Marta. But the Unesco site has a vital role to play in fighting climate change\nFrom the porch of her family home in Nueva Venecia, Magdalena, Yeidis Rodriguez Suarez watches the sunset. The view takes in the still waters of the Cienaga Grande de Santa Marta wetlands. Pelicans dip their beaks into the lagoon, ripples breaking the glassy surface. Distant mangroves turn from green to deep purple in the dying light.\nThe 428,000-hectare (1,600 sq mile) expanse of lagoons, mangroves and marshes in Colombia has been a Unesco biosphere reserve since 2000. Yet, for Rodriguez, 27, the natural abundance is little more than an illusion.\n\"We are a people that have been forgotten,\" she says. \"The Cienaga is depleted. It's already washed out.\"\nThe village of Nueva Venecia and its close neighbour, Buenavista, stand on wooden stilts above the waters of the Cienaga.\nFor decades, the inhabitants of these palafitte communities, as the stilt-house villages are known, have suffered the consequences of poorly managed infrastructure projects, government inaction and pollution that have caused fish populations to plummet and fresh water sources become nearly undrinkable.\nExperts trace the problem to the construction of two highways across the delta in the mid-20th century, which disrupted the natural flow of water between the Cienaga, the Caribbean Sea and the Magdalena River, leading to the widespread salination of the region's mangroves.\nHorst Salzwedel, a marine biologist who has worked in the region since the 1980s, says: \"Although mangroves can tolerate salt in the soil, there is a limit. When it exceeds a certain level, they begin to die.\"\nThe dramatic changes to the Cienaga's hydrology are reflected in the area's plummeting fish populations.\nAccording to Invemar, a government marine ecosystem research institute, the total catch from the Cienaga was 4,721 tonnes between January and September 2024, compared with 9,269 tonnes in 1994 - and a reported 60,000 tonnes in the middle of the 20th century.\nJesus Suarez, 57, collects data for Invemar in Nueva Venecia. Working from a small stilt structure at the edge of the town, he records the contents of fishers' catches as they unload their stock, pencilling notes on sheets of paper.\n\"Fifteen fish species remain that can produce profit,\" he says. \"Once, there were 56 species registered.\"\nSince he came to the town in 1986, Suarez has observed how the changing climate has disrupted the ecology of the Cienaga.\n\"Nowadays, in a single month it can rain the same amount that previously fell over five months,\" he says.\nThe fall in fish populations has hit the main pillar of the local economy. More than 2,500 people live in Cienaga's stilt towns, and thousands of others from the nearby cities of Tasajera and Cienaga depend on the ecosystem for their livelihoods. Many have been plunged into a cycle of poverty from which there appears to be little escape.\n\"The fish are being lost. If there are no fish, there is no money, no food,\" says Andrea Niebles Mejia, 18, who lives in Buenavista with her three-year-old child.\n\"I want to study, but there are no opportunities here and no money to study.\"\nIncluding the cost of transport, food and the course fee, Niebles would only need about 200,000 Colombian pesos (PS35) a month to study - but it is a price she cannot afford.\nAs a large canoe judders through the stilt town, the wind rattles through her home. The boat's wooden hull sits unusually low in the lagoon: it is full to the brim - not with a catch of fish but water.\nIt has arrived from the Magdalena River, which provides most of the drinking water for Nueva Venecia and Buenavista. Boats such as these ferry the water between the river and the stilt towns, using the wooden hull of the canoe as a container. The water is barely treated before being distributed to residents to drink.\nThe longest river in Colombia, the Magdalena, receives industrial discharge from several major cities, as well as sediment from industrial agriculture and heavy metals produced by illegal mining.\n\"The Cienaga Grande is the final part of this system,\" says Sandra Vilardy, a marine biologist who has worked in the Cienaga for almost 30 years. \"These inhabitants are drinking the water with the highest industrial metabolic load in Colombia - without it being treated.\"\nSign up to Global Dispatch\nGet a different world view with a roundup of the best news, features and pictures, curated by our global development team\nafter newsletter promotion\nTraces of heavy metals, including highly toxic mercury, have been found in fish samples taken from the Cienaga, while local people report widespread stomach illnesses among children who drink the water.\nRodriguez says: \"When I drink the water, it causes me a lot of stomach pain. We don't have drinkable water.\"\nThe lack of an effective waste-management system in the town results in large quantities of plastic being dumped in the Cienaga. In addition, only two homes in Nueva Venecia have latrines - most of the town's human sewage goes directly into the lagoon.\nIn response to environmental degradation and the resulting loss of income, residents have sought support from the government - with limited success.\nCesar Rodriguez Ayala, 58, a Nueva Venecia community leader, says: \"When there is a commitment from people who can make a difference and have power, communities change. That is missing.\"\nThe Corporacion Autonoma Regional del Magdalena (Corpamag), the environmental body responsible for dredging canals in the Cienaga - a vital process in restoring water flow - has long been accused of negligence and inaction.\nA recent court ruling ordered it to begin unblocking the Aracataca River, which was once used as a source of drinking water by palafitte communities before it was illegally diverted by powerful landowners to irrigate agriculture.\n\"Corpamag has to come and dredge,\" says Elsy Rodriguez Ayala, 53, a lifelong resident of Nueva Venecia. \"They have to open the canals that they know are our source of life. We don't know why they have not come.\"\nCorpamag has been approached for comment.\nThe benefits of restorating the of Cienaga Grande extend beyond the marsh's borders. \"This is Colombia's most important coastal wetland,\" says Vilardy, adding that allowing water to flow properly again \"is essential to prevent this place from becoming a methane bomb and instead allow it to become a carbon fixer once again\".\nVilardy says Colombia's mangroves provide a buffer against rising sea levels, while water that evaporates from the Cienaga feeds back into rivers in the nearby Sierra Nevada.\n\"It is a very special place for its ability to strengthen and advance climate adaptation efforts, which will be crucial in the tropics,\" she says.\nElsy Rodriguez Ayala, along with many others in her community, is determined to fight for the future of her home. Just next door, men are moving building materials for a new school.\n\"We have raised our children here in Nueva Venecia and Buenavista,\" she says. \"We will stay here as long as God allows.\"",
      "ml_hf_summary": "The Ciénaga Grande de Santa Marta, a UNESCO biosphere reserve in Colombia, is facing severe environmental degradation due to poorly managed infrastructure projects, pollution, and climate change.  This has led to a significant decline in fish populations, making the local economy reliant on fishing unsustainable. The water supply for the nearby stilt towns is contaminated with heavy metals from industrial discharge and agricultural runoff, leading to health issues for residents. Despite efforts by community leaders and environmental organizations, government inaction and lack of effective waste management have exacerbated the situation.  The restoration of the Ciénaga's hydrology through dredging canals is crucial for mitigating climate change and restoring the ecosystem's vital role in carbon sequestration. The future of this unique wetland depends on addressing these challenges and ensuring sustainable development for the local communities. \n"

      "content": "Dayton will host the alliance's parliamentary assembly 30 years after the Bosnian peace accords were signed there\nWhen hundreds of Nato delegates and thousands of ancillaries, protesters and security forces descend on Dayton, Ohio, next month, the visitors will see a town that's clawed its way back from the brink.\nWhite flight in the late 20th century and the 2008 Great Recession saw thousands of jobs and residents leave. More recently, the pandemic forced many downtown businesses to allow staffers to work from home, erasing a key daytime customer base for cafes and restaurants.\nBut in recent years a host of hotels, breweries and eateries have sprung up alongside concert venues and galleries.\nSo, when it was announced that Nato's spring parliamentary assembly was coming to town - 23 years since it was last held in the US - many saw it as an opportunity to share this former Rust belt city with the world.\n\"I want people to talk about what a great time they had here and what a success it was,\" says Larkin Vonalt, who runs Rabbit Hole Books, which sells used books for $1.\n\"It really could be a wonderful event.\"\nBringing Nato to Dayton is the brainchild and a career-defining move for Mike Turner, a Republican Ohio congressman and former Dayton mayor who has been a leading advocate of the transatlantic military alliance for years. This year marks the 30th anniversary of the Bosnian peace accords, which were negotiated at an air force base outside Dayton.\nHowever, many say communication and clarity on the five-day event, which will center on a \"Nato village\" in the heart of the city, have so far been lacking.\nRabbit Hole Books is set to see a security fence dividing the Nato village from the outside world go up right outside its door, says Vonalt.\n\"People attending the conference can't come in, and for the public, nobody wants to go up to a police line to go into a bookstore,\" she says.\nVonalt says she was later told a tunnel would be erected to allow people access to the bookstore, which has added to the sense of uncertainty.\n\"We should either be in or out. Give us the people inside the Nato village who don't have very many places to shop, or give us the regular customers,\" she says.\n\"We want to know where we fit.\"\nLocals are also nervous that the violent scenes that unfolded during the most recent Nato parliamentary assembly in Montreal last fall, which resulted in millions of dollars in damaged property, could be repeated here. Nato doesn't typically contribute anything to a city's hosting of the parliamentary assembly.\nTurner, who was ousted by the speaker, Mike Johnson, in January as chair of the US House intelligence committee, has been heavily criticized by some in Ohio for backing Donald Trump, whose recent government cuts have hit the Dayton area and its tens of thousands of air force employees particularly hard.\n\"It's going to be a holiday weekend which is already a tough weekend for businesses as a lot of people travel,\" says Michael Harbaugh, who runs a food truck and plans to organize a protest during the Nato gathering.\n\"Crowds are usually down, and businesses are not going to be compensated for anything by the city or state.\"\nHarbaugh ran as an independent candidate in last year's congressional election in an unsuccessful attempt to unseat Turner.\n\"I feel like they are not representing a sizable portion of the people here. They are bought-and-sold politicians; the two political parties are a disaster in many ways. It sounds good; it's something for politicians to pat themselves on the back.\"\nDespite being a congressman for an area of Ohio that includes Dayton since 2013, Turner rarely visits his constituency and has refused to hold a town hall in recent weeks, to the fury of many locals who are upset at attempts by Elon Musk's \"department of government efficiency\" (Doge) to eradicate thousands of jobs.\nHarbaugh says the millions of dollars set to be spent on policing and security fencing during the Nato event would be better used elsewhere in the Dayton community, where several years ago opioid deaths were among the highest in the country.\n\"There are so many people going without here,\" he says. \"We should be spending to feed and house people rather than on the rich and powerful.\"\nWhile Vonalt says she supports Nato and hopes the US remains a leading force within it, she's also critical of Turner and his handling of Nato's trip to Dayton.\n\"If you were in charge of this and it was going to affect your town, wouldn't you come home, have a town hall meeting and say: 'I have wonderful news for you - Nato has agreed to come here. It's going to make life a little interesting for a week but think of all the great things Dayton will get from this,'\" she says. \"It should have been done that way.\"\nNumerous emails sent by the Guardian to Turner's communication staff seeking comment received no response.\nSeen as a relative moderate Republican in a party increasingly dominated by far-right insurgents, Turner's single-handed efforts to get Nato to come to Dayton could mean his political career is tied to the success of the parliamentary assembly. Last year, his congressional district was one of a handful that saw a Democratic politician win more votes than a Republican in any race in Ohio. A repeat of the kind of violence that marred the Montreal event could see Turner's longstanding congressional seat threatened.\nStill, for a part of the world that's more often characterized for loss and decline, having the world's largest security organization come to town for an event that is more commonly held in capital cities is viewed by some as a win.\nAbout $1.5m is being spent beautifying the downtown core, and a host of ancillary events are set to draw diplomats and analysts to Dayton.\nSome business owners were happy that a previous, larger version of the Nato security zone was downsized after organizers consulted with local businesses who feared footfall would be wiped out.\nThe event is happening against the backdrop of criticism of Nato by Trump, who has claimed the US may decline to defend other member states in any conflict, as the Nato charter stipulates, if certain countries don't increase military spending. The US pays 16% of Nato's budget, the joint-most of any member state alongside Germany.\nGiven these and other Trump-related tribulations, some Dayton residents are wondering if the gathering will actually ever happen here.\n\"I think there is still the possibility that this will all grind to a halt,\" says Vonalt, \"that we won't be in Nato by the time the assembly happens.\"",
      "ml_hf_summary": "The NATO Parliamentary Assembly's spring meeting will take place in Dayton, Ohio from May 20th to 24th. This event marks the first time since 1993 that NATO has held its parliamentary assembly in the US.  Dayton is undergoing a revitalization after experiencing economic decline and job losses. The city hopes to leverage this opportunity to showcase itself to the world, but there are concerns about communication and security measures. Local businesses are concerned about the impact of increased security measures on their operations, while some residents worry about potential violence similar to what occurred in Montreal last year.  The event is expected to draw diplomats and analysts, with a budget of $1.5 million allocated for beautification efforts. The success of this event could significantly impact Mike Turner's political career as it hinges on the assembly's smooth execution. \n"

      "content": "Justin Trudeau's resignation as prime minister came amid deep anxiety prompted by Trump's tariffs threats\nCanadians will head to the polls on 28 April to decide who will form the next government. Mark Carney and Pierre Poilievre are the most likely candidates to become the next prime minister.\nIn early January, Justin Trudeau announced a decision that many in his party had long hoped for: he was resigning after nearly a decade as Canada's prime minister.\nParty infighting and the prime minister's personal unpopularity had made it nearly impossible for him to face off against his political rivals, especially the Conservative party which had polled as many as 25 points ahead of Trudeau's Liberal party.\nTrudeau's resignation came amid deep anxiety prompted by Donald Trump's threats to impose potentially devastating tarrifs and even annex Canada and make it the 51st US state.\nThe prime minister's decision to stand down kicked off a leadership race within the Liberals. Mark Carney, the former governor of both the Bank of Canada and Bank of England, won a decisive victory and was sworn in as prime minister days later. But Carney, a political novice who had never held political office, was in the role for only nine days when he called a snap election.\nCarney faced two problems: Trump's economic threats and the uncomfortable fact that he didn't have a seat in the House of Commons, meaning he risked becoming a political punching bag for opposition parties - with no chance to hit back.\nFor months, the Conservatives had been the sure bet to win any election. But sensing a rapidly shifting national mood prompted by Trump's aggression Carney calculated a snap federal election was his best option.\nFive political parties were represented in parliament before the election was called. But in most voters' minds, there are two main choices for prime minister: Liberal leader Mark Carney and Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre. Amid the broader concerns over Canada's economic security and sovereignty, opposition voices such as the leftwing New Democratic party, the sovereigntist Bloc Quebecois and the Green party have struggled to remain relevant.\nThere is little daylight between the federal leaders on issues of Canada's relationship with the United States. Both have rejected the idea Canada would ever cede its sovereignty. But while both acknowledge a cost of living crisis and housing unaffordability have left Canadians feeling worse off, they have divergent solutions.\nPoilievre has promised to cut regulations, diminish the role and size of government in order to facilitate homebuilding. Carney, in contrast, is leaning government as a key figure in any wide-scale building effort.\nPoilievre, a brash populist and seasoned parliamentary \"attack dog\", has inspired a fervent response from his supporters, who say he has given a voice to those who feel ignored and mocked by political elites. The Tory leader has told supporters he will crack down on crime, toughening sentences for the worst offenders in a move that he admits would breach the country's charter of rights and freedoms - but promising to use an arcane constitutional mechanism that permits him to do so anyway.\nCarney has largely run a campaign on his economic and business credentials, tacking the party towards the political centre in an attempt to lure in disaffected voters from both sides of the political aisle. Conservatives have used his CV in their attacks, alleging he used tax loopholes when chair of the investment firm Brookfield. Carney has also faced criticism from the Conservatives for adopting their own policy proposals, including removing a controversial carbon tax.\nCanada's federal election is really 343 separate elections across the country held simultaneously. Those parliamentary elections in Canada are normally held every four years and under federal law, an election is required by October 2025 at the latest. Using a parliamentary system stems from the British or Westminster tradition, the party with the most seats typically forms government. If either the Liberals or the Conservatives win 172 or more seats, they will have a majority government. Anything less than that and they will be required to work with other parties to pass legislation.\nIn 2021, the Liberals failed to win a majority and later struck a deal with the New Democratic party, known as a confidence and supply agreement, to help them form a government. The Liberals have indicated that they are campaigning to win a majority government because under a minority government scenario, opposition parties have the opportunity of defeating the governing party in a vote of no-confidence and triggering another election.\nUntil February, the Conservatives enjoyed a 25 point lead over the Liberals. Pollsters gave the Tories a 99% chance of winning if an election were called at the time with one of the largest parliamentary majorities in decades. But Trump's aggressive posture towards Canada has scrambled the stakes of the election: the Conservative's dominant lead has disappeared and now they find themselves trailing in the twilight of the campaign.\nOf the 12 polling firms in Canada surveying voters, all of them show the Liberals leading to the extent that a majority government is the most likely outcome. The math looks even more dire for the Conservatives, with the Liberals enjoying a domain lead in the most vote-rich parts of the country.\nCanadians will vote on 28 April, but advance voting opens in the coming days.",
      "ml_hf_summary": "Justin Trudeau resigned as Prime Minister of Canada in January 2023 due to party infighting and declining popularity, amidst heightened anxiety over potential economic threats from Donald Trump's tariffs. Mark Carney was elected leader of the Liberal Party and called a snap election on April 28th, 2023, facing challenges including Trump's aggressive stance and his lack of experience in political office. The Conservative party, led by Pierre Poilievre, had held a significant lead in polls but faced a shift in public sentiment after Trump's actions.  The election will be held on April 28th, with the outcome likely to determine whether the Liberals or Conservatives form a majority government. Advance voting begins soon. \n"

      "content": "Convicted in 1986 of killing five members of his family, he has always maintained his innocence. This week, new evidence could get him another day in court\nFor Jeremy Bamber, 17 April is D-day. Today, he hopes his case will be sent back to the court of appeal for the second time, and his many supporters believe this will lead to his conviction for murdering five members of his family being quashed after 40 years in prison. They say this is an unsafe conviction at the very least, but maintain Bamber did not and could not have carried out the horrific crimes. Others, including most of Bamber's surviving relatives, remain convinced that Bamber murdered his mother, father, sister and her six-year-old twin boys and should never be released.\nIt could also be a huge day for the Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC), the body responsible for sending alleged miscarriages of justice back to the court of appeal. When the commission started in 1997, it was a beacon of hope for the wrongfully imprisoned - the first independent organisation set up to investigate and refer miscarriages of justice. But over the years it has fallen into disrepute, widely condemned as tardy, conservative and inept.\nBamber's story is not simply that of a potential miscarriage of justice. It is also the story of how long it can take to challenge a conviction. Take his latest submission to the CCRC. It included 10 grounds for appeal, including new evidence showing that Bamber's father, Nevill, rang the police 10 minutes before Bamber did so; police tampering with the crime scene; the existence of a second gun silencer when the trial judge insisted there was only one; and the fact that the police had seen signs of life inside the house while Bamber was with officers outside. So far, the commission has spent four years dealing with four of these pieces of evidence. At this rate, it would take another six years to consider the case, by which time Bamber would be 70. It is believed that the decision to accelerate his case has been made to save the CCRC from further criticism.\nBamber and I have been in touch for almost 15 years. In 2011, I interviewed him with the late Eric Allison, then the Guardian's prisons correspondent, with whom I often worked. Allison was passionate about the case. We asked Bamber how he stayed sane in prison. His answer was either poignant or chilling, depending on your perspective. He said he walked and talked with his father, his mother, his sister and her children - the very family he was convicted of killing. \"In my mind, I walk with my dad more than anybody on a daily basis and think: how would he cope with it? What would he think about it all?\" He told us about a picture he had on the wall in his cell - a drawing by a friend that shows Bamber standing outside the Royal Courts of Justice in London, his hands raised in triumph. \"I look at it all the time,\" he said.\nIt's 7 August 1985. At about 3.30am, the police receive a call from Bamber. Remember the time - it becomes increasingly significant. He tells them his father has phoned to say Sheila Caffell, Bamber's sister, who has schizophrenia, has got hold of one of the Anschutz shooting rifles on the family farm. Bamber tells the police that the line then went dead. He gives them the address - White House Farm, Pages Lane, Tolleshunt D'Arcy, Essex. The police say they will attend immediately. They ask him to leave his home, three miles away, and drive to the farm, where they will meet him.\nEven the most stout defender of Essex police would accept that the incident was appallingly handled. The police stood outside the house for almost four hours, unsure what to do. When firearm officers finally entered at about 7.40am, they discovered a massacre. The crime scene was then compromised in numerous ways - objects and victims appear to have been moved; evidence was burned or not undisclosed; witness statements were changed; police trampled over the bloodied farmhouse.\nFew British crimes have been covered with the salacious relish of the Bamber murders. And few have divided opinion so profoundly. The case had everything - ghoulish murders in a remote setting, a Georgian farmhouse, characters that could have been drawn from an Agatha Christie novel, fights over inheritance, religious extremism, myriad unanswered questions and a police force at war over the identity of the killer.\nNevill was a respected former RAF pilot, a successful farmer and a magistrate. His wife, June, was a much-loved mother, according to Bamber; according to others, she was a religious maniac who made the lives of her two adopted children a misery. Sheila, their 28-year-old daughter, had been a successful model known as \"Bambi\". And then there was Bamber. The handsome 24-year-old was thought to have acted strangely after the massacre and was charged with murder seven weeks later.\nThe prosecution said he had made it look like a murder-suicide, motivated by greed and hatred of his parents. The main evidence against him was provided by Julie Mugford, a girlfriend whom he had jilted weeks after the deaths of his family. Bamber was remanded in custody and, 12 months later, convicted of all five murders on a 10-to-two majority verdict. He was sentenced to a minimum of 25 years in prison, which was upgraded in 1988 to a whole-life tariff by the then home secretary, Douglas Hurd, although Bamber was not made aware of this until 1994. Bamber has challenged the legality of his whole-life tariff. The judge at Bamber's trial described him as \"warped\" and \"evil, almost beyond belief\". If Bamber committed the crimes for which he has been convicted, that description is fair.\nThe original senior investigator, DCI Thomas \"Taff\" Jones, was a tough Welshman who didn't deal in doubt. From the moment he saw the scene, he was clear he was dealing with a murder-suicide. After all, Sheila was found with the gun, a bible by her side and a fatal wound to her throat.\nIn March that year, Sheila had been discharged from hospital after being treated for a psychotic episode. Colin Caffell, her ex-husband and the father of the twins, wrote to Nevill after Sheila was released, saying he feared for the \"health, safety and stability\" of the boys, Daniel and Nicholas, when they were with their mother. He asked Nevill to broach the subject of them coming to live with him \"most of the time\". \"We all know that Sheila lives in her own little world and is almost oblivious to anything but her own thoughts,\" he wrote. \"She's been like that for a long time and the boys are now obviously finding this very distressing.\" Colin wrote that \"witnessing their mother's religious illusions has been most traumatic for them, to say the least\". During Sheila's hospitalisation, the boys had lived with their father in London; when the tragedy happened, they were spending a week's \"holiday\" on the farm with their grandparents and Sheila.\nThree days after the murders, Bamber's cousins Ann Eaton, David Boutflour and Anthony Pargeter met Taff Jones and said they didn't think Sheila could be the killer, because she was hopelessly uncoordinated and inexperienced with guns. (One family member, who doesn't want to be named, says now: \"Poor Sheila couldn't pour a cup of tea without spilling it.\") They believed Bamber had killed the family for the considerable inheritance - in their wills, Nevill and June left PS380,000 and PS230,000 respectively, while the family business, N&J Bamber Ltd, was worth PS400,000.\nBut the cousins' version of events, it seems, made no sense to Taff Jones. After all, there had been sightings of movement within the house when the police had been outside with Bamber. A radio log stated that firearms officers had been speaking to someone in the house at 5.25am. By then, Bamber had been with them for well over an hour. It seemed an open-and-shut case, as newspapers reported in the days after.\nBut Taff had not accounted for the persistence of his junior and namesake, DS Stan Jones. Stan Jones became suspicious when he attended the house after the massacre and noticed Sheila had been shot twice in the throat. What kind of suicide victim shoots themselves twice in the throat?\nThe reality was more complicated - and remains a mystery. After the killings, six officers made statements saying Sheila had one bullet wound to the throat. The doctor who pronounced life extinct and the coroner's officer referred to a single shot. In 2011, it emerged that officers carrying out training exercises moved the gun on and off Sheila's body to ensure it was safe. Some supporters believe the police accidentally shot her a second time. It sounds unlikely - but the handling of the whole investigation was unlikely.\nIt appears the cousins found a more sympathetic listener in Stan Jones, who didn't much care for the belligerence of Taff Jones. (The chief inspector was later sidelined from the investigation, then died shortly before the trial after falling from a ladder.) Eaton, who ran a caravan site with Bamber, told Stan Jones that Bamber didn't look like a man who was grieving. She said he had been acting oddly - laughing and larking about with friends, flogging his parents' valuables, spending money with abandon. Eaton was convinced that he shed crocodile tears at the funeral.\nShe discovered that the kitchen window at the farm didn't close properly and suggested that Bamber could have escaped through it after carrying out the murders, leaving the house apparently locked from the inside. Her father, Robert Boutflour, who has since died, provided the police with an elaborate plan for how he believed Bamber carried out the murders.\nBy now, Stan Jones, who died in 2014, was on a mission to nail Bamber. Three days after the murders, David Boutflour contacted Stan Jones to tell him he thought he had found significant evidence in a downstairs cupboard - a silencer, also known as a moderator, that appeared to have blood on it. The blood was tested. It appeared to be a potential match with Sheila's. Stan Jones then carried out another test. He attached a silencer to a gun and asked somebody the same height as Sheila to pretend to shoot herself. She was unable to do so. The silencer increased the length of the gun and meant she couldn't reach the trigger. Stan Jones believed he had his killer.\nThis is where Julie Mugford enters the picture. The day after the murders, she had told police that Bamber phoned her between 3am and 3.30am, saying: \"There's something wrong at home.\" In her initial interview, she said she was tired and had not asked him what was wrong, even though he sounded worried. Soon after the murders, Bamber broke up with her and Mugford's best friend, Lizzie, told her she and Bamber had slept together. On 4 September, another woman phoned him in Mugford's presence and it became apparent that he was asking her out. Mugford smashed a mirror and slapped him. He twisted her arm behind her back.\nAfter this, she told friends he had been planning the murders for a year because he was hungry for his inheritance; he and Sheila stood to inherit 50% each of the estate, so long as he was still working on the farm. One of these friends called the police. On 7 September, a month after the killings, Mugford gave a new statement, contradicting her first. She said Bamber had hired a hitman, a local plumber, to kill the family and paid him PS2,000. Mugford said Bamber had told her hours before the attack that it was \"tonight or never\" and that he had phoned her in the early hours to say: \"Everything is going well.\"\nThere was only one problem. When the police arrested the plumber, he had a cast-iron alibi. Mugford then changed her story and said Bamber had carried out the killings himself.\nA few months before the murders, the office of the caravan park run by Bamber and Eaton had been burgled and PS980 taken. Eaton suspected Bamber of the theft. The police asked Mugford whether she knew anything about the burglary. Mugford admitted that she and Bamber were responsible. The police then asked if she had anything else she wanted to confess. Mugford admitted she had carried out 13 cheque frauds and smuggled and sold cannabis.\nShe had put herself in a tricky situation. If Bamber was prosecuted, she could be charged as an accomplice. If he wasn't, she could still be charged for the other offences. It seems the police agreed not to charge her if she testified against Bamber. In late 1985, the assistant director of public prosecutions, John Walker, wrote to the chief constable of Essex police stating: \"With considerable hesitation, I would suggest that Mugford be advised that she will not be prosecuted in respect of these matters. Thereafter she will be called as a witness in the case against Bamber.\"\nAfter he was convicted, she did an interview with the News of the World about their relationship, accompanied by a revealing photoshoot. It later emerged she was paid PS25,000 for the interview, enough to buy a two-bedroom flat and start a new life.\nThe trial relied on Mugford's evidence, but it also depended on the silencer. Mr Justice Drake told the jury that if they believed the silencer was used in the murders, the killer had to be Bamber. After 16 days at Chelmsford crown court in October 1986, the jury retired to consider its verdict. The members couldn't reach a unanimous decision. Drake told them he would accept a majority verdict. The jury wrote a note to the judge asking whether the blood found deep in the baffles of the silencer was a perfect match with Sheila's. Drake, who died in 2014, said it was and that it didn't match any other family member. But that wasn't true. Shortly before the trial, forensics had shown that the blood was also an identical match with Robert Boutflour, Bamber's uncle. This was known to the defence, the prosecution and the judge. However, for reasons that are unclear, the defence never used it. Bamber is convinced if it had been used, he would never have been convicted. In any case, the jury came back 21 minutes later and found Bamber guilty. The courtroom was silent except for the sobs of two jurors.\nAfter Bamber was convicted, there was a vicious fight over the inheritance. June's sister Pamela Boutflour, Robert's wife, initially inherited the family estate, which included various business interests, property and land. However, in 1992, an out-of-court settlement was reached with Jacqueline and Anthony Pargeter (the children of Nevill's sister) after they brought a civil suit regarding Nevill's estate. Ann Eaton (the Boutflour's daughter) and her husband, Peter, moved into White House Farm with their family. They still live there today.\nWhen I first spoke with Bamber in 2011, he had been waiting for seven years for the CCRC to respond to his second submission. A year later, they refused to refer his case back to the court of appeal.\nMy colleague Eric Allison and I worked as a team for many years. But it was he who was close with Bamber; he became a patron of the Bamber campaign. Since he died two years ago, I have made an effort to get to know Bamber better.\nIt hasn't been easy. At times, it feels as if he speaks a foreign language. He is so focused on the minutiae: if you can't distinguish between gun silencers, blood types in the baffles of a silencer and the significance of a call at 3.26am rather than 3.36am, you are lost. Myriad documents were disclosed in 2002 and 2011 and Bamber spends his life forensically examining and re-examining them, hoping they will prove his innocence.\nBut underneath the facts and figures, there is a complex person. Years ago, he told me his greatest sense of hurt was over the way his parents have been portrayed in the press as cold, controlling and dysfunctional. He says this couldn't be further from the truth: \"Mum and dad were the sweetest parents you could imagine and they took care of Sheila and I to the very best of their abilities.\" In 1991, Bamber asked for a polygraph examination - also known as a lie-detector test - and, in April 2007, he was given one in prison. He passed. He hoped this might help clinch his freedom, but it made no difference.\nHe blames relatives for the way the family has been depicted. \"They told anyone who'd listen what awful parents my mum and dad were,\" he says. He believes it suited their narrative. \"My relatives were happy to portray me as someone who had been abused by my dysfunctional mum and dad, instead of supporting them as the lovely, kind, generous, hard-working people that they were. They wanted to portray them as [people] who deserved to be killed by a nutter son who had suffered at their hands for all these years.\" Most of our communication over the years has been by letter. The Ministry of Justice refused to add me to Bamber's phone list or to allow me to visit him in prison. Sometimes, his friends have asked him questions on my behalf.\nHis mother has been depicted as a religious zealot. He says this is untrue. \"She didn't ram it down people's throats, as people said. As children, she liked us to say our prayers at bedtime, but she didn't go on about it all the time. I think her Christian faith and studying of the Bible was more because of her frustration at not having enough to do. She would love to have gone to university. Her religious fascination was more the philosophical studying, though she did believe strongly in it.\"\nIf he is innocent, it's hard to absorb the scale of the injustice - imprisoned for the murder of five family members he claims to love. All the time, he is aware of the ticking clock. \"I'm an old man now,\" he told Allison and me 14 years ago. \"I'm 50 and I feel it.\" He had already spent more than half his life in prison. That was when he first alluded to the importance of clearing his parents' name. \"If Mum and Dad were around, they would be proud that I had the self-discipline and staying power to keep with this as long as I have,\" he said. In finding him guilty of the massacre, he believes the court besmirched his family's name. If his sister was the perpetrator, it doesn't dilute the horror, but it is less shaming, because she was ill.\nAs for Sheila, he says she developed a religious fervour, but believes that was part of her schizophrenia. Again, he talks of happy childhood memories - his big sister looking after him, then visiting her in London when she was a successful model and hanging out with her glamorous friends. \"Sheila was wonderful as a sister, but as her mental illness started to kick in, it became difficult to engage with her, because we didn't understand schizophrenia. She was a very kind and gentle child, that's all I can say, really.\"\nWhen she was found, the blood-stained Bible next to her was open at Psalms 51-55. (\"Have mercy on me, O God, according to your unfailing love; according to your great compassion, blot out my transgressions.\"). The theologian Susan Gillingham prepared a report for Bamber's first submission to the CCRC on the significance of the psalms in relation to Sheila's mental state. Gillingham said anyone who knew the psalms well would turn to them as a means to express \"their own penitence at the evil within themselves and outrage at the evil words and actions performed against them by others\".\nHugh Ferguson, Sheila's psychiatrist, gave evidence at the trial. But in a statement in 2002, he said he had been unaware the Bible was open at the psalms. In 2011, having read them, he said: \"They contain in them the themes which, over time, I knew were exercising Sheila Caffell. In short form, the struggle between good and evil, or God and the devil.\" Ferguson had also been unaware of the letter Colin Caffell had sent to Nevill, suggesting he broach the subject with Sheila of the children living permanently with their father. If Nevill had pleaded Colin's case to Sheila, it could have had a \"potentially catastrophic effect on her\", said Ferguson. \"She may have projected on to her father a concept of evil.\"\nAs I work my way through hundreds of documents - a tiny fraction of the total - I wonder how Bamber can be so phlegmatic if he is innocent. \"Knowing how my family died, and why, makes it much easier, because I haven't got someone to hate and despise,\" he tells me. \"I just understand mental illness can manifest in really horrific ways. There's also time. Forty years ago, I felt very different. But today I feel much more empathy with Sheila than maybe I ought to. But I just do. I've come to terms with it and feel sad for everyone.\"\nBamber was taken into police custody on 8 September, a day after Mugford said he was the killer. He was interviewed over a period of five days, the first two of them informally by Taff Jones, without a solicitor. Among other things, he said the night before the murders there had been a debate at the dinner table between Sheila and their parents about the twins being put into foster care.\nFor the next three days, he was forcefully interrogated by Stan Jones. Bamber was asked whether he murdered five members of his family and told they had proof that Sheila had been killed, yet appeared to be asked few specifics about the murders - for example, where were his blood-spattered clothes (none were found) and whom did he kill first?\nInstead, he quizzed Bamber about the order of his phone calls. Eventually, Bamber says, he got confused and gave inconsistent replies about whether he had phoned Nevill or Mugford first. But he still did not believe he was the prime suspect: \"At the end, DCI Taff Jones stormed in and said: 'This is a load of nonsense; we don't believe Julie.'\" On 13 September, Bamber appeared at Chelmsford magistrates court and was granted bail on charges of burglary of the caravan park office. He then went to St Tropez for 10 days with a friend. On his return, he was greeted at Dover docks and charged with five counts of murder.\nWas Bamber convicted more on character than on the strength of the evidence? He came across - or was made to come across - as unlikeable: the playboy cad who couldn't wait to inherit the family money, who had slept with his girlfriend's best friend, who started selling the family treasures and took himself off to the south of France for a luxury holiday just after his family died, who smiled smugly after the funeral and as he was being driven to prison in the police van. A villain from central casting.\nBamber takes me through these points. Yes, he did have a liaison with Mugford's best friend. Yes, it was bad behaviour. But no, it wasn't the seduction that was depicted. \"All three of us were friends. Lizzie said to Julie: 'When you were away, Jeremy slept with me.' Well, it was her sleeping with me, that's the way it was.\" He sounds embarrassed. There is no dignity in his argument, but it's important to him in the way things played out. \"Julie always said: 'If I ever find out you slept with Lizzie, I will kill you,' and that is why she tried to kill me.\" Mugford admitted to the police that, after learning about Bamber and Lizzie, she had tried to smother him with a pillow, saying: \"If you were dead, you would always be with me.\"\nAs for selling off the valuables, he says he sold things only once he realised Ann Eaton, who had a key to the farm, had taken valuables without his permission. She has always said she took them for safekeeping because she didn't trust him.\nHe laughs off the idea he was a man about town. For one thing, he says, he was too mean. \"The only nightclub I ever went to was Peter Stringfellow's, because Sheila used to take me and Peter would let me in for free because he remembered me as a 14-, 15-year-old sneaking in with Sheila and her friends. I was too tight to spend all that money in fancy nightclubs. It's just not my thing.\"\nIn the 2020 ITV drama series White House Farm, he is shown living it up by the pool in France, drinking cocktails. He admits he spent one night in a hotel, paid for by an older woman with whom he had a fling. The rest of the time he was in a caravan. Why did he go on holiday just after his family had been killed? He says his head was all over the place and he was desperate to get away. It wasn't a good look. \"We all cope with grief in different ways. Normally, relatives and especially grandparents would have raced around and supported me.\" The only relatives he had left believed he was a murderer.\nThen there is the infamous smile. Bamber tells me it is easy for photographs to lie without the benefit of context. \"I'd been crying profusely, sobbing embarrassingly, because we'd been brought up not to show that kind of depth of emotion. I got back in the funeral car and people asked how I was and I did that smile to reassure them.\"\nThe \"incriminating\" photograph used most frequently shows him smiling as he is driven off in a police van. \"They use that all the time. My friends were on the pavement and I was just smiling at them and waving goodbye. Again, it was to reassure them.\" He says that is his character: he has never wanted people to worry for him. He didn't want it when his parents were killed, nor when he was charged with their murders; neither does he want it when people visit him in prison. \"I'm not sobbing and feeling sorry for myself, because I'm not that kind of guy. I want to reassure people that I'm OK - and most of the time I am OK. I don't want people to leave the visits and see me sobbing my eyes out and feeling sorry for me. I want people to go away saying: yeah, Jeremy's strong and he's doing OK.\"\nIn 1997, 12 years after Bamber was jailed, the CCRC was established. Before then, alleged miscarriages of justices were dealt with by a shady Home Office department known as C3, which was neither independent nor well resourced. The CCRC was created after a series of high-profile cases from the 1970s were exposed as miscarriages of justice. In 1989, the convictions of the Guildford Four were quashed, followed by those of the Birmingham Six and the Maguire Seven in 1991. These cases featured a mixture of false confessions, police misconduct and nondisclosure, the last two of which Bamber claims have led to his wrongful conviction. The idea was that the CCRC would hire a group of well-paid experts with the drive, expertise and time to thoroughly investigate suspect convictions and order them to be returned to the court of appeal where necessary.\nBy the time the CCRC was established, Bamber had already been refused the right to appeal by the Home Office. Prisoners can apply for permission to appeal a crown court decision and usually have to do so within 28 days of conviction. Bamber had argued that the judge had misdirected the jury in his summing up of the trial. In 1989, three years after being found guilty, he was told his submission had been rejected and would not be returning to the appeal court.\nThe creation of the CCRC gave Bamber new hope. He had entered a second submission three years earlier to the Home Office, which was now transferred to the CCRC. He was convinced that, with its statutory investigative powers, the commission would expose the many inconsistencies and failings in the investigation and trial and refer the case back to the appeal court. Sure enough, in 2002, it did.\n\"I had to wait until DNA testing became advanced enough to test the sound moderator for traces of blood,\" he says. \"The DNA test was eventually done on the baffle plates inside the sound moderator and it was shown that there was none of Sheila's DNA present. The next day, my case was referred to the court of appeal.\" Bamber also argued that his conviction was unsafe due to police misconduct, including alleged corruption, failure to disclose crucial evidence, destruction of evidence, concerns about witness credibility and inheritance-related motives not being disclosed.\nHe was so convinced he would be a free man by Christmas 2002 that he didn't bother ordering a Christmas lunch. He told anyone who would listen that his conviction was about to be overturned. But, in a 522-point judgment, the three appeal court judges concluded that no conduct on the part of the police or the prosecution would have adversely affected the jury; the more they examined the details, they said, the more they thought the jury had reached the right conclusion.\nIn 2004, Bamber made a new submission to the CCRC. He was convinced he had compelling new evidence. Scratch marks on the kitchen mantelpiece, which the jury had been told suggested a struggle between Bamber and his father, did not appear to exist in the original crime scene photos. \"On the evidence of the scratch marks alone, you may find Mr Bamber guilty,\" the trial judge had said. Experts had also concluded that the wounds were consistent with \"the rifle not having a silencer attached\". Again, the jury had been told use of the silencer was enough to convict Bamber.\nThis time, the CCRC did not refer Bamber's case back to the appeal court. It stated that the new evidence and legal arguments presented were \"matters of pure speculation and unsubstantiated allegations\". Bamber was devastated. He argued that the CCRC had failed to thoroughly investigate his case and that there was a conflict of interest, because its then investigations adviser, Ralph Barrington, was formerly the head of criminal investigations at Essex police.\nOver the years, the CCRC has become increasingly enfeebled. Critics have suggested it is not truly independent of the MoJ. In 2013, full-time commissioners who had been on salaries of nearly PS94,000 were put on minimum one-day-a-week contracts at the insistence of the MoJ. At one point, the CCRC had only nine commissioners, although by statute it is required to have at least 11.\nIn 2018, Allison and I, with our colleague Owen Bowcott, reported that a group of prominent lawyers had deemed the commission unfit for purpose. The lawyers had found that a record low of 0.77% of cases seen by the CCRC had been referred to the court of appeal in 2016-17. \"Almost all the cases being prepared by professionals working in this field are being refused,\" said Matt Foot, then of the civil liberties law firm Birnberg Peirce, now a co-director of the miscarriage-of-justice charity Appeal.\nLast year, Andrew Malkinson had his rape conviction overturned after serving 17 years in prison. He had first applied to the CCRC 15 years earlier. Writing in the Guardian, Malkinson said: \"It was left to my legal team at the charity Appeal to do the work the CCRC should have done long before. Appeal commissioned further DNA tests and uncovered disclosure failures that finally forced the CCRC to send my case to the court of appeal in January 2023.\" He was exonerated in July 2023. In January 2025, the head of the CCRC, Helen Pitcher, resigned. She claimed she had been scapegoated over the Malkinson failings and pointed out that the organisation was under-resourced.\nWhen asked about Bamber's case, a spokesperson for the CCRC said: \"Mr Bamber has now made three applications to the CCRC. Following a review, the first application in 1997 led to Mr Bamber's case being sent to the court of appeal, and his conviction was upheld. The second application to the CCRC in 2004 did not result in a referral. A third application received in 2021 is currently under thorough review. It would be inappropriate to comment any further while this review is ongoing.\n\"The CCRC has received more than 33,000 applications in its 28-year history and made more than 850 referrals to the appellate courts. We employ a range of staff from many backgrounds, with skills and experience appropriate to the difficult work they do.\"\nBamber's legal team made its third submission to the CCRC in 2021. Again, they were obliged to find new evidence to prove his innocence. Bamber has always believed his father contacted the police to say Sheila had \"gone crazy\" and got hold of a gun. In fact, it had been part of the previous submission. But the CCRC concluded the argument was unconvincing. This time, Bamber believes he has proof of the calls.\nIn 2011, he received 347,000 pages of documents initially withheld by Essex police under public interest immunity laws, which no longer apply after 30 years. In this mass disclosure, he came across an incomplete rolling police log. It starts with an entry at 3.26am stating that \"Mr Bamber\" had called from White House Farm at that time. It reads: \"Daughter Sheila Bamber aged 26 [sic] yrs has got hold of one of my guns.\"\nNeither the jury nor Bamber's legal team had knowledge of this document. What they had seen was the note of Bamber's report to the police. \"Father phoned (age 62) 'Please come over your sister has gone crazy + has the gun' Phone went dead.\" This was timed at 3.36am, 10 minutes after the call apparently from his father. At the trial, it was suggested to the officer who had taken the call from Bamber that he had intended to write 3.26am, rather than 3.36am. He reluctantly agreed that this could have been the case.\nYears later, it became apparent why this was crucial for the prosecution. The first police car was sent out at 3.35am, a minute before the time given for Bamber's call. This makes sense only if Nevill had called 10 minutes earlier, at 3.26am. Another document that Bamber came across through bulk disclosure revealed that the officer was still on the phone to him at 3.37am.\nIn 2016, a documents expert, Dr Chris Davies, studied the new evidence and concluded the most likely reason for the inconsistencies was the obvious one - there were two phone calls. \"I consider that this would be my preferred explanation for them,\" he said. If Nevill did call at 3.26am, it puts Bamber in the clear. It would be impossible for him to travel the three-and-a-half miles home, over the sea wall and moonlit fields on his mother's \"sit up and beg\" bike, as the prosecution claimed he had done after the murders.\nLast July, the New Yorker published an exceptional 17,000-word article by Heidi Blake about the Bamber case. Blake had done the investigating the CCRC had seemingly failed to do in the four years since Bamber's most recent submissions. She interviewed surviving officers, including Nicholas Milbank, who had been monitoring the open line into White House Farm.\nMilbank is one of the great mysteries in the case. He never made a statement for the investigation or the trial. His only appearance was in a 2002 inquiry, known as Stokenchurch, by the Metropolitan police into the original investigation. In the Stokenchurch inquiry, there is a reference to a 999 call that had come from the farmhouse at 6.09am. Underneath is a statement attributed to Milbank saying he had monitored the open line, but heard nothing until the police entered. There is no mention of a 999 call. Surprisingly, the statement is unsigned.\nBlake got in touch with Milbank, who still works for Essex police. He told her that a 999 call had come in at 6.09am from inside the farm and that he had heard human movement. Blake asked him if that suggested somebody was alive in the house. \"Well obviously,\" he replied. She said he was taken aback when she told him there was a statement in his name saying he had heard nothing. He had given no such statement, he said, and nobody had asked him for one.\nSoon after publication, Bamber wrote to me. He was delighted by the piece and once again convinced he would soon be a free man. \"The real crime is that from 6.09am on 7 August 1985, Essex police knew someone else was alive and inside the farm and that they made a 999 call. That fact was concealed from the courts, the public, the media et al. My view is that this is what I'll win my freedom on, the falsifying of a police officer's witness statement, without his knowledge.\" But his self-belief camouflaged a more muted realism. In saying that ultimately he believed this would clear him, he also acknowledged that he might have a much longer wait. The CCRC is not considering the evidence uncovered in the New Yorker article.\nIn response to Bamber's allegations, a spokesperson for Essex police said: \"In August 1985, the lives of five people, including two children, were needlessly, tragically and callously cut short when they were murdered in their own home by Jeremy Bamber. In the years that followed, this case has been the subject of several appeals and reviews by the court of appeal and the CCRC - all of these processes have never found anything other than Bamber is the person responsible for killing his adoptive parents Nevill and June, sister Sheila Caffell and her two sons Nicholas and Daniel. Essex police have continued to comply with all legal requirements in this case and will continue to assist the CCRC as required.\"\nBut already something positive has come out of the New Yorker article. Although the CCRC still has six grounds to investigate, it is expected to rule on the first three or four grounds today. He believes the decision has been expedited by media reports about the commission's failings and the New Yorker article. Bamber says if his case is not referred back to the appeal court, he will have the decision judicially reviewed immediately. He tells me he is getting ever closer to restoring the reputation of his parents.\nI find it hard to comprehend. A man who has spent 40 years in prison for murdering his family says he is more interested in clearing his parents' names than his own. I think of what he said to Allison and me all those years ago about spending time in his head with his mother, father, sister and nephews. Does he think of his family as much these days? \"As time goes on, my memory fades,\" he tells me. \"But yes, of course, I think of them, particularly on birthdays. I was thinking about my mum and what we used to do on Mother's Day. Dad and I would go off to get chocolates and cards and it was fun. We'd give Mum breakfast in bed. So it does still come back, but it's not as strong as it was 40 years ago. Sadly, memories fade. They just do.\"\nWould somebody who had murdered his family admit that his memories of them were fading? Would somebody who told his girlfriend that he was planning the murder and that it was \"tonight or never\" finish with her a few weeks later? Surely he would be wedded to her in guilt and their terrible shared secret for life?\nIt's 4 November 2024. Bamber's style of letter writing has not changed over the years: big block capitals on lined prison paper sent from HMP Wakefield. Today, there is no disguising his excitement. \"Before I answer all your questions, I am going to share some breaking news with you.\" He says he has found definitive photographic proof that there were two silencers, something the police and prosecution have always denied. Since day one, he has claimed there were two. (Bamber believes the silencer has always been a red herring - that Sheila shot the family without using a silencer.)\nHe tells me he is not giving the exclusive of the new silencer to the Guardian; he owes it to another media outlet that helped him track it down. But he sends me pictures and trusts me to keep the news under my hat. The silencer shown in the new pictures looks much like the previously disclosed silencer, except there is a piece of yellow tape wrapped around one end.\nIn 2018, Frank Ferguson, the head of special crimes at the Crown Prosecution Service, wrote to Bamber's lawyer Mark Newby, saying: \"Any evidence that suggests that there was or may have been another silencer for the rifle would raise the possibility that the other silencer was used during the shooting and not the one alleged by the prosecution. Such a possibility would significantly undermine the case against JB and any material supporting such a possibility would plainly be material which casts doubt on the safety of the conviction.\"\nMarch 2025, Hove. I visit Philip Walker, one of Bamber's campaign team and a semi-retired finance manager. Walker splits his life between work and Bamber. Has he fought for a miscarriage of justice before? \"No, never,\" he says. What drew him in? \"I was adopted through the church, like Jeremy, so I was interested when I read about him. And his father was a big character, well known locally, and so was mine. Then I read a book about him and came to the conclusion that the case was fatally flawed.\" He started to read more and more about Bamber. \"In one of his blogs, he wrote about his father and it struck a chord. The way he spoke about him, I thought: that is not somebody who's pumped eight bullets into his dad.\" Seven years on, Walker could be a Mastermind contestant with Bamber as his specialist subject.\nBamber phones when I am with Walker, who asks questions about his daily life. How does he fill his days when not researching his case? \"Just doing normal jail,\" Bamber says. \"I go to work in DHL, packing bags for the prisoners' canteen. I do a bit of gym. It's very basic stuff. I go to work, I get visits, use the phone, write letters to people and that takes a lot of time. Keeping up with correspondence. All the lovely people who support and love and care for me while I'm in jail.\"\nIn many miscarriages of justice there is a good reason for prosecutors to pursue the suspect: a false confession, made under duress; suspicious behaviour; an unrelated crime. Bamber thinks the caravan park burglary gave the police grounds to suspect him of the murder. \"It was a stupid thing to do and I didn't think it through, but when they asked me about it I admitted it straightaway. And they used that to say: 'Well, if you're prepared to do that...'\" He trails off.\nBamber insists he was taking back money he believed belonged to him. He also says he wanted to prove to Ann Eaton, after a series of break-ins, that they needed security cameras. He succeeded in making his point, he says, and she agreed to install CCTV.\nAnn Eaton and her brother David Boutflour declined to talk to the Guardian for this article. They have always insisted that they have no doubt about Bamber's guilt and denied that their suspicion of Bamber was motivated by financial considerations.\nMugford, who has rarely spoken publicly about the case since selling her story to the News of the World, later worked at a primary school in Canada. In 2001, she said: \"As far as I am concerned, nothing has changed - I sincerely believe he is guilty. Do I stand by my original story? Yes, absolutely. I always assumed he would be in jail for life.\" She did not respond to the Guardian's request for comment.\nBamber believes that, after confessing to crimes in her police statement, Mugford was trapped. \"You think to yourself: well, you'd have never been a teacher if all that had come out. And that pressure - if you don't give evidence against Jeremy we'll probably charge you with doing it with him ... And all those other criminal activities you've done without Jeremy we'll charge you with them.\" Bamber was initially charged with burglary of the caravan site, but the case was later dropped. Mugford was not charged with any crime.\nBamber hopes the CCRC will refer his case, but he is already planning for the next stage if he is knocked back. His capacity for seeing the glass half full has always amazed me. How does he keep going? \"I've got fantastic support. I've got people who love me and people who I love. Even though I'm in jail, in life, I've been very lucky to have that, because many people don't. I have had a good life in many ways because the experience I've had and the people I've met have been so interesting.\" It's an astonishing thing to say - jailed for 40 years and yet, in some ways, he still feels lucky.\nBamber says his conscience is clean. \"I know I didn't murder my parents. What's happened to me has happened to me, and I've just gone away and coped with it and lived the life I've lived and I'm OK. Of course, seeing me recognised as innocent is important, too. But that motivated my campaign for only a few years - I don't need to prove I'm innocent, I just am. Now, what motivates me is showing that my mum and dad were loving and generous and wonderful to me and Sheila and that this whole thing was a tragedy, not a murder.\"\nHe may not need to prove his innocence to himself, but he needs to prove it to others. Whether the CCRC believes he has done enough to merit another appeal remains to be seen.\n Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

      "ml_hf_summary": "This article paints a complex and fascinating portrait of Jeremy Bamber's life and his ongoing fight for exoneration. It raises several important questions about justice, the criminal justice system, and the human condition. \n\n**Here are some thoughts on the issues raised:**\n\n* **The burden of proof in a miscarriage of justice:** The article highlights the immense difficulty faced by those seeking to overturn convictions, especially when facing decades-long imprisonment. It raises the question: how can we ensure that the process for proving innocence is fair and accessible? \n* **The impact of trauma on individuals:** Bamber's story underscores the profound psychological toll of wrongful conviction. His resilience in maintaining hope and his ability to find meaning amidst suffering are remarkable.  \n* **The role of public opinion and media scrutiny:** The article touches upon how external pressures, like media attention and public perception, can influence legal proceedings. It raises questions about the balance between individual rights and societal expectations. \n* **The complexities of human nature:** Bamber's story reveals a complex tapestry of emotions: guilt, denial, hope, and resilience. It challenges us to consider the nuances of human behavior and the potential for both good and evil within individuals.\n\nUltimately, this article serves as a powerful reminder that justice is not always straightforward. It compels us to examine our own biases and assumptions about truth, innocence, and redemption. \n"

      "content": "Online dissent is a serious crime in China. So why did a Weibo censor help me publish posts critical of the Communist party?\nIt is 2013. For four full months, Liu Lipeng engages in dereliction of duty. Every hour the system sends him a huge volume of posts, but he hardly ever deletes a single word. After three or four thousand posts accumulate, he lightly clicks his mouse and the whole lot is released. In the jargon of censors, this is a \"total pass in one click\" (Yi Jian Quan Tong ), after which all the posts appear on China's version of X, Sina Weibo, to be read by millions, then reposted and discussed.\nHe logs on to the Weibo management page, where many words are flagged. Orange designates sensitive words that require careful examination - words like freedom and democracy, and the three characters that make up Xi Jinping's name. While such words regularly appear in newspapers or on TV, that does not mean ordinary citizens can use them at will.\nRed is for high-risk words that cannot be published and must be deleted: \"Falun Gong\", the banned spiritual group; \"64\", representing June 4, the date of the 1989 Tiananmen massacre; the names of Liu Xiaobo and the Dalai Lama; \"Jasmine\", because, after the Tunisian revolution of 2011, several small-scale demonstrations that have come to be known as China's \"Jasmine revolution\" have made the Chinese government nervous.\nAfter three years as a censor, Liu detests his job. He detests the white office ceiling, the grey industrial carpet and the office that feels more like a factory. He also detests his 200-odd colleagues sitting in their cubicles, each concentrating on their mouse and keyboard as they delete or hide content.\nOne afternoon, the office boredom is disturbed when Chen Min in the next cubicle suddenly jumps up, limbs flailing ecstatically. He has uncovered Wang Dan's Weibo account. All the censors know that Wang Dan, one of the 1989 student leaders, political criminal and exile, is considered by the Chinese government to be one of the most important enemies of the state. Finding him is a big deal, and the news is immediately reported to the Sina Weibo office in Beijing. It might even be reported to the public security bureau.\nThe following month, a senior manager comes specially from Beijing to highly commend Chen Min for discovering intelligence about the \"enemy\", praising his \"acuity\" and \"high level of awareness\", and bestows on him a small bonus. All his colleagues applaud and shout in admiration. All except Liu. He sits amid the crowd and glares at Chen Min's face, flushed red with excitement, and asks himself: is this worth it?\nThe day shift is 11 hours and the night shift is longer - 13 hours. During the breaks, most of the censors sneak away to smoke and chat in the stairwell. Liu doesn't smoke and has nothing in common with the others to gossip about. Bored stiff, he logs on to a VPN service to circumvent the great firewall of China and uses Google Earth to wander streets in unfamiliar cities, fantasising about the people there and their lives.\nHe often logs on to the Weibo webpage, not as a censor but as an ordinary user. On Weibo, his username is Ordinary Fascist (Pu Tong Fa Xi Si ). It's a satirical name but Liu is unsure whom it satirises.\nHardly any of the censors use Weibo themselves, and Liu never tells his colleagues that he does. It would not occur to them that Liu has so much to say on Weibo and posts so much \"unhealthy\" and \"inappropriate\", let alone \"illegal\" and \"reactionary\", content. Liu never gets into trouble. He knows all the sensitive words that are flagged and how to avoid them. In these days Weibo posts are limited to 140 characters - that will change later - and he resorts to all kinds of ruses to ridicule the Communist party and mock the government. He employs sensitive words, but the censors ignore them because they are too busy looking for those flagged orange or red.\nIn spring 2014, the Chinese government begins to purge influential Weibo users, the so-called big V - as in, verified - accounts. A journalist at the People's Liberation Army Daily is so impassioned that he publishes a post on Weibo calling all big Vs vermin who must be dealt with severely. A few minutes later, Ordinary Fascist posts an extremely vulgar comment that essentially suggests the journalist should engage in frenzied sexual congress with his mother. This post generates even more comments and reposts. Many find the abuse gratifying, but no one knows that the author is himself a censor.\nOrdinary Fascist is tasked with following more than 300 Weibo users, mostly big Vs, the majority of whom are people brave enough to occasionally criticise the political system. In the official view, they are \"factors of instability\" and thus dangerous elements. Among them are journalists, professors, lawyers and even an occasional star of the big and small screens. Although most of their posts are tactful and restrained, likening the government to a violent husband or a pissant blowing their own trumpet, few realise that they are witnessing the pinnacle of freedom of speech in communist China, the golden age for a generation.\nNo matter how tactful, restrained and oblique the criticism, the Communist party still detests it. A lot of content is deleted, and accounts on Ordinary Fascist's watchlist frequently disappear for no apparent reason. These people are banned from posting, their accounts are shut, and some of the individuals behind them are even arrested by the police.\nLiu appreciates and sympathises with these people. He sometimes uses his powers to furtively lift the bans on frozen accounts and salvage deleted or hidden posts. Years later, Jenny Ho still remembers Liu's help restoring her frozen account. She is from Hong Kong and in 2013 publishes several posts about the Hong Kong protests. She is then banned and for several weeks cannot post anything. Just as Jenny prepares to register a new account, Liu sends her an email telling her he has surreptitiously unblocked her account. \"I didn't know him, but he helped me a lot,\" says Jenny. \"I often wonder, what sort of person is that? Why would he risk doing that?\"\nFrom Liu's point of view, there was no danger: \"If discovered, I might get a dressing down or lose a few points on my performance evaluation. The worst possible outcome would be termination, which was no big deal because I had already decided to quit.\"\nAt this point, Liu has just turned 30. He has a childish face, though a few grey hairs have appeared prematurely. He is also unrealistically optimistic. His violation of workplace ethics is far more dangerous than he imagines. And even more dangerous is his collecting of Weibo censorship files. The most significant files are the censors' \"shift handover files\" because they record the orders from superiors when a new sensitive incident occurs, when a new sensitive individual's name or a sensitive word is added to the forbidden word list, and when instructions are issued on how to employ more efficiently the four lethal weapons available: \"delete, hide, stop, and make private\". Liu doesn't know why he is collecting those files other than his belief that they are important: \"They are a part of contemporary history.\"\nWhen he hands in his request to resign from the job, Liu feels relieved. \"At last,\" he thinks. \"I can finally leave this shithole.\"\nFive days later, as Liu is completing his resignation paperwork, he logs on to the Weibo back-end management page. He notices that one of the big V accounts he follows is cancelled. It belongs to the author Murong Xuecun. Me.\nIt is 2013 and I am a bestselling author and a verified Weibo user with a small blue capital V after my name. In a little over two years, I publish more than 1,800 posts on Weibo. Many of these posts criticise or ridicule the Communist party. They are wildly popular, generating countless comments and reposts. I am frequently praised for my bravery, but upon reflection, my indirect criticism and mockery is not true bravery. Everything I say is permissible. Everything I publish is also permitted. At most, I hit a few aces. In this, I am no different to many public intellectuals of this time who never point at the elephant in the room and call for an end to Communist party rule. Of course, should I say things like that, my account would be immediately cancelled and I would probably be disappeared.\nBy May 2013, I have close to 4 million followers on Weibo. Such large accounts are not handled by Liu. Weibo allocates a personal censor, known as a Weibo gatekeeper. Mine is Jia Jia . Whenever I write inappropriate content, she phones me. \"Mr Mu, that post of yours won't do. I deleted it for you.\" Sometimes she tells me the names of the people and the events that cannot be mentioned, so I can take a detour around the forbidden zone.\nShe says \"we\", not \"you\". When she refers to such matters, she speaks softly, her tone suggesting that this is a consultation, as though she were a sister or a close friend. I never meet, Jia Jia but I feel obliged to say, I quite like her work style. Yes, she is a censor, yet she is so gentle in her work, so considerate, not lacking in human warmth. In China, censors like her are rare and precious.\nI don't know why my account is cancelled and no one tells me the reason. Jia Jia won't tell me.\nXi Jinping has just ascended to power and hasn't yet revealed his true intentions. Many people still place high hopes on him. They think he will take China on the path to democracy.\nSoon, however, an internal document called Seven Things Not to Talk About (Qi Bu Jiang ) breaks their hearts. This document clearly shows Xi's aspirations. It prohibits university-level teachers from discussing seven topics in class: universal values, freedom of the press, civil society, civil rights, historical mistakes of the Communist party, powerful bourgeoisie and judicial independence.\nThe day the document is leaked, I have a busy schedule. I give a public lecture at a library and then rush to a gathering. In the car on the way to this meeting, I write a short comment on Weibo. I suggest that the Seven Things Not to Talk About is just one thing: culture is prohibited.\nThe gathering is in a fancy restaurant in the centre of Beijing. There are a dozen or so of us - professors, lawyers, journalists and human rights activists. We drink a few bottles of wine, eat some expensive dishes and discuss the future of China. At this time, many are confident the Communist party's rule cannot possibly last much longer. China will have a bright future. \"The sky will soon be light,\" a professor says to me. \"We will definitely see it.\"\nNone of the participants foresees that, in 10 years, half the people around the table will be in jail. Some, like me, will be living in exile. Those still in Beijing will have long been silenced and will not utter a word. The optimism that we share at this distinguished gathering will feel illusory and distant, like a fleeting dream.\nOn the way home from the get-together, I receive a message from a friend whose Weibo account was closed the previous day. I, like most Weibo users, consider account banning a serious matter, so I publish a harshly worded question on Weibo: \"Who gave you the right to arbitrarily deprive citizens of their freedom of speech?\" Retribution is swift. Within 20 minutes of this posting, my account is cancelled.\nThe Cyberspace Administration of China is the premier censorship agency in China. The newly appointed boss, Lu Wei, popularly known as the \"internet tsar\", begins to implement a series of severe purges of online speech. Countless accounts are cancelled, and many people are thrown behind bars for what they wrote online. But that's just guesswork. In China, there's no need for a good reason to block someone's account. A powerful government agency can simply issue an order to make a person disappear from public life.\nMany people feel my treatment is unfair. They light virtual candles for me and hold \"memorial services\". My Weibo gatekeeper, Jia Jia, the gentle censor, telephones me and, though apologetic, she, too, thinks I should be a little more careful. \"There's no need for you to get into direct conflict with them, don't you think?\"\nShe declines to tell me which agency issued the order, only referring to \"higher levels\".\nI hope that, in consideration of our close relationship, Jia Jia will tell me the details, but she responds: \"I'm sorry, Mr Mu, I really cannot reveal this. You know we sign non-disclosure agreements. Please show me some empathy. I have a life, too, right?\"\nIt's my last telephone conversation with Jia Jia. I then register multiple accounts, but each one is cancelled. I imagine Jia Jia is aware of this, but she does not contact me.\nThe next day, around dusk, my friend Yu Dayou calls to tell me he received an email from a stranger. The email is about me and he forwards it. It is just one line: \"Please forward to Murong Xuecun.\" There are two attached images. They are screenshots of the Weibo management page that contain detailed information about my account: time of registration, IP address, my mobile phone number, the reason for the deletion of each of my posts and the blocking of my account, as well as the answer to the question I pestered Jia Jia about: which agency and who ordered my account to be cancelled.\nIt is Liu's last day at Sina Weibo. The handover is complete and his possessions are packed. He just needs to endure a few more hours and he can leave that putrid place for ever. Liu does not know me and has not read my books. He has read a few of my posts in his role as a censor, but they don't leave a deep impression. He sees the momentous memorial for my Weibo account and then goes out of his way to look at the Weibo administrative page. At first, he doesn't think much about it, but gradually an idea forms in his mind. Perhaps he can do something.\nHe considers rescuing the Murong Xuecun Weibo account but the order to cancel it has come from a very high level, so it is impossible to quietly reactivate it like other accounts, without anyone noticing.\nLiu has signed the same censors' non-disclosure agreement as Jia Jia, though he is determined to violate it. When no one notices, he furtively copies two screenshots on to his own flash drive. He knows the value of the two images, but he can't send them directly; he must find an intermediary.\nLiu finds Yu Dayou in the list of Murong Xuecun's followers. Yu is a not particularly successful businessman, and his words and actions never overstep the boundaries. Liu calculates that Yu will escape notice. Liu spends a little time reviewing Murong's communication records to determine that Murong and Yu are in contact with each other. This is the one, Liu tells himself.\nThe time to leave arrives. Liu carries his scant belongings out of that grey skyscraper and walks a few hundred metres along the ancient Grand Canal that connects Beijing to Hangzhou, pondering whether to do it. Getting caught would certainly mean arrest and possibly a prison sentence. How long? Two years? Three years? At most three years, no longer.\nHe walks into an internet bar, finds a secluded seat and registers a new email account with the username Nameless.\nHe sends the two images to Yu Dayou and adds a one-sentence message. After sending the email, he sits silently in front of the computer for a while, recalling the three years of his life as a censor. He thinks about his family and his girlfriend Alice*. In a few days, he will marry Alice. She probably will not understand the significance of what he has just done. Best not tell her, to avoid making her worry.\nAfter 40 minutes, Yu Dayou replies: \"The friend asks, can this be made public?\"\nLiu has already thought this through. As soon as the images are published, Sina Weibo will definitely try to track down the leaker. They may make a police report. Liu hesitates. He considers the number of people who have access to that page, at least three or four hundred. They would not necessarily suspect him.\n\"OK to make public,\" Liu replies. \"In any case, they are unlikely to find me.\"\nHe logs out of the email account and erases his browsing history. He then checks again to be sure he has not left any traces before he is confident enough to stand up. There are a lot of youths playing video games all around. They are engrossed with their computer screens and yell out chaotically. None of them notices him. Liu silently walks out of the internet bar, head lowered. It will soon be dark. He brushes his sleeves as though flicking off three years of grime. He walks quickly to merge with the people strolling at dusk.\nThe two screenshots Nameless sends me contain many names: Weibo censors, some censorship managers, as well as the name of the person who cancelled my account. And then there is Old Mr Chen, the editor-in-chief of Weibo. He was once my friend, but our friendship ends here. In his eyes, I must have become a \"sensitive element\", like a pathogen to be avoided.\nThe key name in the screenshot is that of \"Minister Peng\": Peng Bo. He has just been promoted to vice-ministerial rank, becoming a member of China's privileged class, the lawless nomenklatura. He delivers speeches at meetings claiming he will \"thoroughly cleanse cyberspace\" - that is, he will eliminate all voices detrimental to the party, which is the reason he issues the order to cancel all my social media accounts.\nOne afternoon two months later, I cannot restrain myself any longer: I use a newly registered account to write a threatening post to Peng on Weibo. In it, I say: if my account is cancelled again, I will deploy all my resources to investigate your corrupt deeds and make them public. \"The day this account is cancelled is also the day you will be jailed. Don't say you weren't warned.\"\nThese words are not me firing blindly in the dark. Before his promotion, Peng was a journalist, an editor and a publisher. We have many mutual acquaintances and friends and, despite the constant refrain of words such as \"honest\" and \"upstanding\" on his lips, many people suspect that he is corrupt and licentious. Common sense suggests that a high official with as much power as Peng is unlikely to be as honest and upright as he claims to be.\nPerhaps that is why Peng is apprehensive about dealing with my threat. After about a month, my new Weibo account is cancelled. It's around midnight. I have just returned to my apartment when I receive a call from the editor-in-chief of Sina Weibo, my erstwhile friend, Old Mr Chen, who featured in the screenshots. He sounds very nervous. He says the order to cancel my account comes from an organisation and has nothing to do with Peng. He admonishes me \"not to be used by others\" - that is, by Peng's political enemies.\n\"Peng began his career as a journalist. He's the same as the two of us. We're all the same,\" says Old Mr Chen. \"Moreover, when he cancelled your account last time it was not of his own volition. He was following orders so don't fuck with him, OK?\" Chen then suggests I meet with Peng for a chat. \"Now, just the three of us. We'll go somewhere for a drink and talk about this, OK?\"\nDuring the next two hours, I receive six phone calls like that from Old Mr Chen at Peng's instigation. Apart from Old Mr Chen, a mutual friend calls to say something along the lines of: \"Don't fuck with him. Starting a vendetta will not be good for you.\" I ignore them all. I begin to draft a public announcement offering a 200,000-yuan reward for evidence of Peng's corruption. And then Yu Dayou telephones: \"If you keep this up, Peng will be very dangerous. If you can't beat him, the guy who gave you the tipoff will be in deep trouble. He helped you out of the goodness of his heart, so you can't implicate him.\"\nLiu knows nothing of this. He does not read my essay and does not know about my war with Peng. In the summer of 2013, he marries Alice and holds a reception at a fancy restaurant in the city of Tianjin. There is a throng of well-wishers, relatives and friends. Liu drinks a lot of alcohol. He occasionally thinks of his former career as a censor, which still makes him feel nauseated.\nAfter the wedding, a relative introduces Liu to a temporary job in a state-owned enterprise. Alice is carrying their first child. To earn more, Liu takes a job at a TV and film streaming service, where he is a quality control manager. The work has no connection to censorship, but he works alongside censors. Every day he sees new official censorship orders. Some of the orders are unbelievable. One variety show compere says he almost \"died laughing\". In subtitles, the word \"died\" must be put inside double quotation marks, otherwise it is a breach of regulations. It's as though viewers are considered not intelligent enough to understand an extremely simple phrase.\nLiu begins to collate these orders. He copies censorship orders page by page, then uploads them to cloud servers outside China's great firewall. After four years, he comes to believe the material is extraordinarily significant. He secretly vows that one day he will release it to the public.\nAs the censorship file grows, he becomes increasingly nervous. He has no illusions that what he is doing is more than enough for a three-year jail sentence at minimum. Five or six years is entirely possible, and eight or 10 years is not impossible. His son has just begun to walk and his daughter has just been born. If the police drag him away, the family will be destroyed.\nLiu stays quiet. He refrains from making new friends and doesn't share his true feelings with anyone. He walks around with his head lowered out of fear of attracting attention. In a city of 15 million people, not a single person knows that he is engaged in dangerous work.\nBy now I have vanished from public life in China; my books cannot be sold, my essays cannot be published. I live in isolation in a small apartment in Beijing. I frequently have money worries and I frequently think about Nameless. What sort of person are they? Why take such an enormous risk to disclose sensitive information to me? Yu Dayou and I agree that whoever they are, that person is extraordinary. \"If this riddle is ever solved,\" says Yu, \"I will definitely treat that person to a good meal.\" I, too, want to thank them.\nMeanwhile, Peng's political career progresses smoothly. He is constantly on TV and quoted in newspapers. He hosts meetings and publishes speeches that call for people to \"study well, publicise well, and implement well the spirit of General Secretary Xi Jinping's important speeches\".\nHis power grows: in addition to managing public opinion on the internet, he is also responsible for the \"prevention of and dealing with cults\" - that is, the repression of and attacks upon faith communities. My religious friends are beaten and arrested. In 2018, Peng becomes a professor of journalism at China's most important university, Peking University. In the classroom, he tells students: \"I'm not an official; I'm just a foot soldier in the line of fire.\"\nAt the end of 2019 and in early 2020, Covid-19 spreads. First, in Wuhan, and then to the whole world. Within a few years, several million people lose their lives. In China, Xi pushes his cruel Covid policies that transform the country into a huge prison. At the slightest pretext, cities with populations in the millions are completely locked down. No one can leave their homes without permission, even to buy food. This applies also to people with urgent medical conditions or pregnant women about to go into labour.\nLiu decides to leave China because he can't take any more of living like a prisoner. He is even more concerned about the censorship materials he has collected. The Chinese government begins to deploy QR codes to control the lives of Chinese people: tracking codes, venue codes, health codes. No matter where you go, QR codes must be scanned and reported to the government to detail your movements and location. One little error and you are subject to searches or even imprisonment. \"If they look through my mobile phone, I'll be finished,\" Liu thinks. \"I have to leave immediately.\"\nBut there are hardly any flights. Tianjin airport is closed. He takes Alice and their two children to Beijing and catches one of the last planes to Los Angeles. Once the plane is in the air, he is finally able to relax, even though he wonders whether he will ever be able to return to China. Later, he would tell me: \"It was like a desperate escape from a house on fire.\"\nAbout the same time, I buy a train ticket and sneak into Wuhan, which is still under lockdown. I stay a month in the city, interviewing people about their experiences during the lockdown, then hide in a hotel in the mountains of south-western China, where I spend several months writing Deadly Quiet City: Stories from Wuhan. When the book is about to be published, I carry a single suitcase to make it look like I'm taking a short trip. I tremble with fear as I am leaving China. Until the moment I clear customs, I'm uncertain whether the government will permit this \"sensitive element\" to leave China. Once on the plane, just like Liu one year earlier, I realise that I may never be able to return to my country again.\nBy this time, Peng is suspended from his job and under investigation. This means his government career is over. According to official reports, he has taken bribes totalling 54,640,000 yuan (PS5.6m). People in China know that bribery is not his only crime, and perhaps not his most serious. When high officials like Peng are punished, it is because they have sided with the wrong political faction or shown insufficient political loyalty. Despite his constant studying, publicising and implementation of the spirit of President Xi, it appears that Xi still felt Peng was insufficiently loyal.\nMeanwhile, Liu is enjoying his American life. The day they arrive in Los Angeles, his family eats at In-N-Out Burger. He likes it so much that he will make a tradition of going to this restaurant every year on this date to buy a few burgers, a big bag of fries and cups of soda. Every time, they raise their cups to commemorate their free lives.\nOne day, Liu sends me a direct message on X. He is excessively polite. He writes: \"Mr Murong, please forgive me for presumptuously disturbing you,\" before asking whether I remember the email sent via Yu Dayou with the two screenshots. My heart is pounding. I say: \"Yes, I remember that. I wondered who sent that email. I am most grateful.\"\nWe have a long phone call like long-lost friends. We describe everything we have done since leaving China. He says: \"I wish to testify that although I was a Weibo censor, I am not a bad person.\"\nI reply: \"I will speak on your behalf.\"\nMany publications report on Liu. He is praised for being like the secret agent in the film The Lives of Others, or a North Korean refugee. He eagerly takes a job at China Digital Times, where he works on editing the censorship files he collected. They are published one by one, making them freely available to anyone who wants to read them to gain insight into just how evil is the system in which he once worked. \"I used to be a censor, but now I'm engaged in anti-censorship work,\" Liu tells me. \"It really is like a dream.\"\nLiu and I agree to get together one day in the future, either in Australia or the US. We will toast to our freedom and everything he did in that nameless era.\nIn my homeland, high-security prisons hold many of my friends: lawyers, journalists, priests - whose suffering is interminable. Now Peng joins their ranks. In November 2022, he makes his final public appearance on TV at his trial. He wears a navy-blue Mao suit and thick, black-framed glasses as he stands impassively in the dock. Official reports say he has committed many crimes, including a \"collapse of ideals and beliefs\", \"disloyalty to the party\", \"engaging in superstitious practices\", \"violations of the rules against attending private clubs\", as well as accepting bribes for a total amount that includes the inauspicious number \"64\". He is sentenced to 14 years in jail. Peng declares to the court that he accepts the verdict and will not appeal.\nState TV devotes barely two minutes to reporting Peng's case. There are many closeups of this 64-year-old former high official, former professor and former \"foot soldier in the line of fire\" framed between two towering police officers, making him appear weak and in his dotage. His remaining hair is completely white.\n* Some names have been changed.\nA longer version of this piece was first published in Made in China Journal.\n Listen to our podcasts here and sign up to the long read weekly email here.",

      "content": "Up and down the country, volunteers are coming together to plant more of these nature-rich reserves\nThe 30-metre ridge runs across the moor near Yar Tor on Dartmoor, one of several faint lines that crisscross the land like aeroplane contrails. Although the open moorland looks wild, we are standing on some of the UK's oldest farmland. These ridges, called reaves, are the ghosts of farming's most wildlife-rich legacy: hedges.\n\"These reaves sadly have no function today other than to delight us. Or some of us,\" says ecologist Rob Wolton. But Dartmoor's reaves are the skeletons upon which more recent hedges were built: hundreds of thousands of miles of them. After Ireland, the UK is believed to be the most hedge-dense country in the world, and Wolton says the majority of them are more than 280 years old. Recent laser scanning shows England has enough hedges to wrap around the world almost 10 times. They are, by far, the country's biggest nature reserve, which is why community groups, farmers and charities are rallying together to plant hedges of the future that will offer the same support to wildlife as the ancient hedges of the past.\n\"Wouldn't you like to do something that you knew might be there in a thousand years?\" says Jon Stokes, the director of trees, science and research at the Tree Council and chair of Hedgelink, who describes planting a hedge as \"one of life's great joyful things\".\nHedgelink is a partnership of more than 30 organisations planting and restoring the next generation of ancient hedges.\nAfter the second world war many hedges were ripped out, with approximately half lost between the 1940s and 1990s due to agricultural intensification and development. \"Since 1990 we seemed to have turned the tide,\" says Stokes. Recent figures suggest the net length of hedges is stable, and possibly increasing.\nUp and down the country people are coming together to plant hedges. Thirty volunteers can plant 300 metres of species-rich hedge in a day. \"You can see what you've done and you can see what's ahead of you, and it's a beautiful, finite task,\" says Stokes.\nLooking closely at a single hedge, you can see why they are so valuable to nature. Bearded lichens, mosses, liverworts and hairy caterpillars have made themselves at home in one thick, earth-filled stone wall in Dartmoor: an old reave that has been built on over time. Scrubs and trees grow out of the top, where a chiffchaff is singing. Tussocky grass on either side is a habitat for voles, mice and shrews. \"Ancient hedges have ancient things,\" says Wolton.\nAbout 70% of the UK is farmed, and for wildlife within that landscape, a well-kept, bushy hedgerow is like checking in to the Ritz hotel. They are wildlife superhighways, providing shelter for birds to nest, protection for burrowing mammals and a larder of berries over winter. More than 500 plant species, 60 species of nesting bird and almost all native small mammals are supported by hedgerows, according to the People's Trust for Endangered Species (PTES).\n\"We still have a richness of hedges that is the envy of our European neighbours,\" says Wolton, who says they are \"as variable as the British weather\".\nStokes says there is \"never a lack of appetite to plant hedges\" but it is limited by available funding, which comes from a mix of local councils, government, charities and private sources. It costs PS20 to PS25 to plant one metre of hedge, he says. \"The opportunity to plant hedges across the country is vast,\" because they can fit in edges of land, along roads or in the bottom of gardens.\nFor most of the 20th century, there was little appreciation for the age and value of hedges. It was not until 1997 that hedges in England and Wales were given legal protection, thanks to the introduction of hedgerows regulations. The government has pledged to create or restore 45,000 miles of hedgerow in England by 2050 in view of their contribution to nature and carbon sequestration.\nThe loss of hedges is having an impact on wildlife. Turtle doves like overgrown hedges of at least 4.5 metres tall, and between 1970 and 2018 their population fell by 98%, a decline that has been linked to loss of hedges. Dormice are also unwilling to move across gaps in hedges, and their population crashed by 72% between 1993 and 2014.\nExisting hedges are poorly cared for - either cut too severely and frequently, or not managed enough. Only about half of the hedgerows in England are in good condition, research estimates.\nRejuvenating a hedge means \"laying\" it, which involves partially cutting and bending live shrubs and trees near the stem and weaving them together. Few people now have the time or skills to lay hedges, which needs to be done every 25 to 40 years. \"No hedgerow looks 1,000 years old. That ancientness is hidden,\" says Megan Gimber, a key habitats officer at PTES, who advises farmers on how to manage hedges. \"Hedge laying is essentially the key to their immortality. They die unless we lay them,\" she says.\nGenerations of farmers have moulded generations of hedges, but these skills are being lost. \"Hedges are one of the best bits of wildlife on a farm. And hedges rely on farmers: without the blood, sweat and tears that goes into rejuvenating a hedge, they would slowly turn into a line of trees,\" says Gimber.\nBack on Dartmoor, Wolton points out hedges built in different millennia, layers of farmland built on one another, as man moved from the bronze age into the medieval period, into the modern age. Each are fingerprints of the past. A new generation of hedges is being planted by today's farmers. \"You can see places where hedges have been removed and people are planting new hedges and restoring history,\" says Wolton.\nWe have inherited a landscape full of ancient hedges and now we are contributing to that legacy, Gimber says. \"I love the idea that we are on this brink of this really ambitious target to plant or restore 45,000 miles of hedging, and we get to be the architects of that,\" she says. \"We get to make a lasting impact on the landscape.\"\nFind more age of extinction coverage here, and follow the biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield in the Guardian app for more nature coverage.",
      "ml_hf_summary": "Volunteers across the UK are planting new hedges to restore the legacy of ancient hedgerows.  These hedges, which have been a vital part of the UK's landscape for centuries, provide habitat for numerous species and contribute significantly to biodiversity. The UK boasts the highest density of hedges in the world, with estimates suggesting England has enough hedges to wrap around the globe almost 10 times.  The reave ridges, remnants of ancient farming practices, are being revitalized through community efforts, with organizations like Hedgelink coordinating planting projects.  While hedge loss was significant after World War II, recent efforts have stabilized and even increased the length of hedgerows. The UK government has pledged to create or restore 45,000 miles of hedgerow by 2050, recognizing their importance for nature conservation and carbon sequestration.  The restoration of hedges is crucial as they provide vital habitat for numerous species, including turtle doves and dormice, whose populations have declined due to the loss of these natural corridors.  Hedge laying, a traditional technique involving weaving shrubs and trees together, is essential for maintaining the longevity of these ancient structures. \n"

      "content": "Bryce Elder\nPublishedApril 17 2025\nSimply sign up to the Private equity myFT Digest -- delivered directly to your inbox.\nIt'd be nice to imagine that veterinary services are recession-proof. Worming tablets and hairball treatments seem like they should be non-discretionary purchases. The $60bn-plus of private equity cash flowing into petcare over the past decade was premised on the hope that demand would be price-inelastic.\nThe facts appear to be somewhat different. Per Morgan Stanley:\nA Morgan Stanley/AlphaWise survey of 75 US vet practices showed first-quarter patient volumes dropping 1.9 per cent in the first quarter, the worst reading since the series began in mid-2021. \nVet practice revenue showed its first decline on record, down 0.5 per cent, the survey showed, with more than three-quarters of vets saying that customers have been arguing about prices. They reported declines in new patient appointments, existing patient check-ups, diagnostic testing and discretionary procedure volumes. \nBecause it captures fewer struggling independents left behind by corporate consolidators, Morgan Stanley's vet survey usually offers a more sunny view than the wider industry. Private-equity backed firms are estimated to control about half the US market share. But since the average life of the patient is not much more than a decade, there's a constant need to attract new customers. Any practice with a small catchment area will tend to be in decline.\nData from Vetsource covering more than 5,000 US practices shows vets hiking prices over the past few years as visits drop from post-pandemic highs:\nIt's price inflation that makes the data hard to untangle. US prices for veterinary services have jumped roughly 60 per cent in the past decade, as MainFT reported in January:\nCritics of [private equity's] \"roll up\" strategy say the price rises stem from reduced competition in what was once a \"mom and pop\" business. The industry counters that bill inflation is more the result of advances in animal healthcare and of owners expecting ever more sophisticated treatments for their increasingly pampered pets.\nThat trend appears to be accelerating. Ninety-two per cent of respondents to Morgan Stanley's survey said they had raised prices over the previous 12 months, with nearly a fifth of respondents saying they had raised prices by 9 per cent or more. \nAsked to guess why visits were down, price inflation was the vets' second-most popular answer after the macroeconomy. Also notable is the tick higher in respondees blaming a reduction in pet ownership:\nAnd, tellingly, slightly more than half of vet practices said they were still managing to eke out revenue growth year-on-year. \nMorgan Stanley's survey finds that of all vet services offered, acute care was the only category from which revenues continued to tick higher. A decline in preventive treatment probably helped that trend. \nIf pushback on vet bill inflation continues to strengthen and the US economic outlook continues to weaken, that's probably not good for the life expectancies of Milo and Luna. \nHowever, some PE firms are already positioned to benefit from pet owners' difficult decisions. BC Partners bolted a crematorium operator to its VetPartners business in 2021, for example, and Imperial Capital-owned Gateway Services has been rolling up competitors in what it euphemistically calls \"pet aftercare\". \nAnimal funerals are not cheap: UK operator Dignity Pet Crematorium quotes PS70 before casket, urn and transport costs for cremating a goldfish, PS130 for a chicken and up to PS300 for a dog. Whether demand is more or less recession-proof than worming tablets and hairball treatments remains to be seen.\nFurther reading:-- Is private equity behind the surging cost of veterinary care? (FT)-- Vets IPO likely to test the market's animal spirits (FT)",
      "ml_hf_summary": "A recent Morgan Stanley survey revealed a decline in US pet healthcare visits, with revenue dropping for the first time on record.  The survey found that patient volumes decreased 1.9% in Q1 2025, and nearly three-quarters of vets reported customers discussing price increases.  Price inflation has been a significant factor, rising roughly 60% over the past decade, with many vets raising prices to offset declining visits. While some private equity firms are capitalizing on pet owners' financial constraints by acquiring crematorium operators, the long-term impact of this trend on pet care demand remains unclear.  \n"

President Donald Trump earlier this month put tariffs of 145 per cent on many Chinese imports in a move that will probably hit both economies. \nThe Pentagon has placed CATL on a list of companies with alleged ties to the Chinese military. While such listings have no legal impact, they serve as a warning that the US government has concerns about the listed entities. Lawmakers have also raised concerns about US carmakers using batteries manufactured by CATL.\nIn the letters, Moolenaar told the banks that continuing to underwrite the initial public offering would expose themselves and American investors to \"significant regulatory, financial, and reputational risks\".\nMoolenaar said US lawmakers had previously expressed concern about reports that the People's Liberation Army Navy may soon use CATL's lithium-ion batteries to power non-nuclear submarines.\nMoolenaar told the chief executives that if their banks did not withdraw from the IPO, \"it risks supporting a company linked to the ongoing genocide of Uyghur Muslims in Xinjiang, China, the erosion of American manufacturing, and the engagement of US service members\".\n\"We are troubled by reports indicating that JPMorgan and other American banks aggressively pursued the IPO of Chinese military company CATL despite clear and public knowledge of CATL's military-related designation and associate with sanctions entities,\" Moolenaar wrote in the letter to Dimon.\nThe Chinese government has repeatedly denied that it has engaged in human rights abuses in Xinjiang. CATL has previously denied that it has any connection to the Chinese military or entities that have been accused of human rights abuses in Xinjiang. \nThe Chinese embassy in Washington has been approached for comment.

      "summary": "Vladislav Zubok’s monumental account is not just history, but a reassessment of a stand-off that still shapes geopolitics today",
      "content": "Charles Clover\nPublishedApril 17 2025\nYour guide to what the 2024 US election means for Washington and the world\nTen years ago, a book about the cold war would, in the words of historian Vladislav Zubok, have been a record of \"dangerous but ancient times\". Today, with the US again locked in rivalry with Russia and China, and phrases such as \"sphere of influence\" and \"proxy war\" back in common use, it is actually the three-decade holiday from great power confrontation that followed the 1989 fall of the Berlin Wall that now seems to be the anomaly in need of an explanation. \nThe Cold War, Zubok's monumental and still highly readable history of the US-USSR confrontation period, explores how that conflict not only shaped the post-1945 world but also the parallels with the \"new world disorder\" emerging today. \nMuch of the ground -- the flashpoints from Berlin to Cuba to Vietnam -- may have been well covered. But the interpretations -- particularly how the cold war began and how it ended -- are still being pursued by rival camps of experts. And, by smartly knitting together the past with the present, Zubok's book brings a prescient and fresh perspective. \nAn emigre historian who teaches at the London School of Economics, Zubok witnessed the cold war from the Soviet side and sprinkles the book with personal anecdotes -- such as the time he was reported to the KGB by a teacher for a school presentation on the US. Seeing the conflict from both sides is the strength of the book; Zubok pays attention to the unresolved faultlines of cold war scholarship and their ideological implications in the present day. \nWas the descent into confrontation following the Grand Alliance of the second world war an avoidable result of US paranoia? Or would Stalin, if left unchallenged, have rolled Soviet ideology throughout Europe? The answer may be relevant to the furious debate today over China. \nZubok sides 'with those who claim the Cold War was caused by the US decision to build and maintain a global liberal order, not by the USSR's plans to spread communism in Europe'\nHistorians such as William Appleman Williams have argued that the US exaggerated the threat of communism, and Stalin sought a balance in Europe, rather than domination. The opposing camp, led by John Lewis Gaddis and others, have argued that Stalin's intentions were never about balance: his goal was rather \"to dominate that continent as thoroughly as Hitler had sought to\", Gaddis wrote in his 2005 book The Cold War: A New History.\nZubok lands in the former camp, arguing that those who claim America had to act to save Europe from Stalin have overstated the threat he posed. The postwar USSR was weak and hungry, and Europe, despite the efforts of strong communist parties in France and Italy, had little interest in communism.\n\"I side with those who claim that the Cold War was caused by the American decision to build and maintain a global liberal order, not by the Soviet Union's plans to spread communism in Europe,\" he writes. \nIn other words, it was Washington's messianism, not Moscow's, that turned the tide towards mutual paranoia. The US -- not unreasonably -- considered that a world order based on balance between empires had failed the continent and resulted in the second world war. Washington wanted to replace a European system of balance of power and spheres of influence with an effort to allow Europeans to freely choose their destiny, including eastern Europe. Moscow saw this as a subversive effort to revise the 1945 Treaty of Yalta and grab their hard-won zone of influence. The Berlin blockade brought the conflict into the open and cast the Soviets as the villain. \nLike some recent revisions to cold war history, notably Sergey Radchenko in his book To Run the World, Zubok downplays the role of ideology in the struggle between east and west, instead focusing on the international system of great power politics as the crux of the conflict. \"The spectre of Mars, not Marx, led to the division of Europe into east and west,\" as Zubok puts it. In other words, Russia sought (and is still seeking, most would argue) a world order in which the interests of great powers were recognised and took precedence over the aspirations of lesser nations. \nThis had been epitomised by the 1945 Yalta conference, during which Stalin, Churchill and Roosevelt split Europe into zones, feeding the Soviets' coveted recognition of their equal status. \"Stalin and his successors valued the 'Yalta order' enormously and considered it the bedrock achievement that made the Soviet Union a recognised world power,\" Zubok writes.\n\"For the rest of the Cold War, every successive Kremlin leader would strive to reach this benchmark again and again, each time coming up against their main detractor, the United States.\" \nWestern triumphalists argue that US resolve and pressure won an inevitable victory; opponents see Moscow as the agent of its own fate\nThe thawing of the cold war began with Richard Nixon's path-breaking 1972 trip to China, where Zubok concentrates, counter-intuitively but interestingly, on the effect this had on Brezhnev, who feared being outflanked in the east and launched an ultimately shortlived detente with the US president. As Zubok writes, Henry Kissinger, Nixon's national security adviser, \"used his opening to China to affect Soviet behaviour, yet he also managed Soviet fears and employed a backchannel to the Kremlin for constructive negotiations.\"\nZubok describes how the Soviets' obsession with grand bargains, aimed at cementing their status, led to a conspicuous own goal: the 1975 Helsinki summit, which Soviet foreign minister Andrei Gromyko saw as akin to the Congress of Vienna and new \"Concert of Europe\", a system of great power relations that defined much of the 19th century. The Helsinki Final Act's focus on human rights instead became a new genie of US diplomacy.\n\"We know today that Brezhnev's ambition to have a 'Concert of Europe' backfired, and his belief in a bilateral partnership with Washington proved elusive,\" Zubok writes. \"The Final Act became indeed the foundational text of a new Europe, yet not what the Soviets had hoped to see. Human rights, enshrined in the document, became a scripture of internationalist liberalism.\" \nThe overall effect of Zubok's account is to realise how much of the spontaneity and contingency that we once thought drove human affairs in this period was actually hammered out by foreign policy bureaucrats in saunas, hunting lodges and back rooms. Was the \"people power\" witnessed in eastern Europe in 1989 ultimately the result of this US-Soviet bargain? \nRecommended\nThe end of the cold war is just as much of a Rorschach test as the beginning, writes Zubok, inviting the rival camps of experts to see whatever they wanted. Western triumphalists argue that America's resolve and pressure won an inevitable victory; their opponents see Moscow as the main agent of its own fate. \n\"Historians can endlessly argue about what came first, the economic and Cold War pressures that pushed [Mikhail] Gorbachev and his circle of reformers to dismantle the old Soviet system, or the idea of a revolution that led to the weakening of the Soviet Union,\" Zubok writes. \"My own view is the latter but it is impossible to convince those who believe in the former.\" \nBut one thing is \"obvious\", he concludes: \"the main engine for the multiple endings of the Cold War was in the Kremlin.\"\nThe World of the Cold War: 1945-1991 by Vladislav Zubok, Pelican PS25, 544 pages\nCharles Clover is FT's security & defence correspondent and a former Moscow bureau chief\nJoin our online book group on Facebook at FT Books Cafe and follow FT Weekend on Instagram and X",
      "ml_hf_summary": "Vladislav Zubok's book \"The World of the Cold War: 1945-1991\" explores the origins and course of the Cold War, arguing that US actions were the primary driver of the conflict.  Zubok challenges traditional interpretations by emphasizing the role of international power dynamics in shaping the Cold War, rather than solely focusing on ideological differences between the US and USSR. He contends that the US's desire to establish a global liberal order led to confrontation with the Soviet Union, which sought to maintain its sphere of influence in Europe.  The book details key events like the Yalta Conference and the Helsinki Final Act, highlighting how these decisions shaped the Cold War dynamic. Zubok concludes that the end of the Cold War was ultimately driven by internal pressures within the Soviet Union, particularly Gorbachev's reforms. \n"

      "summary": "A production version of a two-door Genesis concept is edging closer to being built, with the G90-based X Gran Coupe or X Gran Convertible the leading contenders.",
      "content": "Genesis has revealed two-door concept after two-door concept, but it has yet to release a two-door production vehicle. That could change soon.\nEarlier this month at the Seoul motor show, Genesis previewed two concepts - the X Gran Coupe and X Gran Convertible - based on its flagship sedan, the Mercedes-Benz S-Class-rivalling G90.\nOf the over half a dozen two-door concepts Genesis has revealed, it's most likely one of these two G90-based models will be put into production.\nHundreds of new car deals are available through CarExpert right now. Get the experts on your side and score a great deal. Browse now.\n\"We believe that it's time now to bring a coupe typology of vehicle - coupe, maybe a convertible - as a production vehicle,\" Genesis chief creative officer Luc Donckerwolke told media, including CarExpert, at the New York motor show.\n\"I'm very positive and next month will show the potential of the demand of the markets, and then I hope very soon we'll have good news about that.\n\"We will not let that go. There have been numerous designs and the reason that I'm doing is because I'll never give up on that.\"\nBut Mr Donckerwolke wouldn't confirm whether a production version of the X Gran Coupe or X Gran Convertible would be built in right-hand drive.\nNotably, the G90 sedan is left-hand drive-only, and is the brand's only model not to have a right-hook version.\n\"I cannot answer yet, that is something that we have to look at, but obviously our goal is to always be a global premium luxury brand,\" he said.\n\"That means that we have to aim to all the markets simultaneously. That is one of the big tasks that we have.\"\nThe two concepts share the 3190mm-long wheelbase of the standard-length G90, affording them a spacious back seat.\nThey also use the same 3.5-litre twin-turbo V6 engine with an e-supercharger, which in the sedan produces 305kW of power and 549Nm of torque and is mated with an eight-speed automatic transmission and either rear- or all-wheel drive.\nMr Donckerwolke confirmed earlier this month production versions would use \"the further development of this powertrain\".\nHe told media in New York there has been a positive reception internally to the concepts.\n\"I made sure that when I was doing those cars that I was reusing the major investment... Now talks are being made with all the regions, we have very positive resonance, very strong demand,\" he said.\nThe latest X concepts may be the most cost-effective of all the brand's two-door concepts to produce.\n\"There was absolutely no compromise to be done in the design and desirability of the product by taking the platform of the G90,\" he added Mr Donckerwolke, noting the G90's platform wasn't modified at all for this year's X two-door concepts.\nThe Genesis brand was only established in 2015, and Mr Donckerwolke said that it hasn't been the right time for a two-door model from the brand until now.\n\"We have been doing coupes and we have been looking at the business cases for each of the concepts we have done,\" he said.\n\"The brand being so young, you are realising that sometimes the market is not ready for those products yet because obviously they are quite exclusive and you have first of all to build up and to consolidate the brand.\n\"Once you have achieved that, you can then do one step higher at a time.\n\"Now we believe it's the right time. We have been doing projects like the bespoke program, One of One, which are showing us that there's a big demand for a more exclusive Genesis.\"\nGenesis launched with a pair of sedans, and it initially had a sedan-heavy lineup. That may have been fine for sedan-hungry Korea, but in export markets such as ours and the US, SUVs account for a huge proportion of luxury car sales.\nThe brand subsequently followed up its sedans with a range of SUVs, which is expected to grow further with the GV90 - previewed by last year's Neolun concept - and potentially even a production version of this year's X Gran Equator concept.\nGenesis appears to have closed the door on production versions of its earlier trio of related concepts, the X and X Speedium coupes and X Convertible.\nThe company never released powertrain details for these, other than to say they used electric power.\n\"After having tried EV coupes and convertibles, we realised that people were not ready yet, so we said okay let's take an existing platform,\" said Mr Donckerwolke.\nElectric coupes and convertibles are rare. Maserati has electric Folgore versions of its GranTurismo and GranCabrio, but other luxury brands restrict electric power to vehicles with four or five doors.\nWhile Genesis has been slow to launch a two-door, the luxury coupe and convertible market is a shell of what it was.\nLuxury brands like Acura, Cadillac, Lincoln and Volvo don't offer a two-door and haven't done so for years.\nAudi recently ended production of its TT and R8 and has yet to confirm replacements for its A5 coupe and convertible, while Infiniti recently axed its Q60 coupe leaving it with no two-doors.\nThen there are the brands that still offer coupes and convertibles, but in smaller numbers than before.\nMercedes-Benz, for example, has in recent years axed its S-Class coupe and convertible, merged its C-Class and E-Class coupe and convertible models into a single CLE line, and axed its SLC roadster.\nLexus is ending production of the RC, leaving just the LC, while BMW reportedly won't replace its 4 Series and 8 Series coupes.\nMr Donckerwolke dinged brands that have resurrected coupe nameplates and applied them to different vehicles. Though he didn't name names, examples of this practice include Ford's Puma and Capri and Mitsubishi's Eclipse Cross.\n\"It's a bit sad when you see the lineup that you see in most of our competitors. We are in a phase where you are getting rid of all of the most extroverted vehicles in the lineups,\" he said.\n\"It's kind of normal to... sometimes, take a car from the past, take this name, and sell it as an SUV. It's a big betrayal of the heritage of the brand. We will not do this.\"\nMORE: Genesis teases a pair of new flagship two-door conceptsMORE: Will Genesis actually build its latest sexy two-door concepts?\nOriginally published as Luxury brand could fill void left by Mercedes-Benz S-Class coupe, convertible\nSign up for our emails\nFind out More\n(c) West Australian Newspapers Limited 2025",

      "content": "Olympic gold medallist and former Federal Senator Nova Peris says she was appalled by Hawthorn legend Jason Dunstall's joke about Willie Rioli's late father at a Australian Rules Football Hall of Fame function last year.\nDuring the speech, Dunstall told the crowd how one of the few people he had beaten at a pre-season endurance race in the 1990s was Rioli Snr, who died from a heart attack in 2022 aged just 52.\n\"We had a young man come down from the Top End by the name of Willie Rioli... don't think Willie had done much conditioning, he looked like an 18-gallon keg on legs,\" Dunstall told the crowd.\nHe said towards the end of the race he \"got the scent of my first kill and it was invigorating.\"\n\"I put my neck out on the line and got him and a week later he was back in the Top End, poor old Willie.\"\nPeris, a fierce advocate for First Nations rights, wrote an impassioned opinion piece detailing how offended she was by the comments and how it spoke to the barriers facing real acceptance for Indigenous Australians.\n\"To make a joke at his expense from the podium of one of football's highest honours is not just poor taste, it is cowardice. And it is a stark betrayal of what that honour is meant to represent,\" Peris wrote in the Herald Sun.\n\"Dunstall concluded the anecdote by noting that Rioli returned to the Top End shortly after.\n\"That wasn't just a throwaway line. It was a deliberate attempt at humour at the expense of a man who had passed away, a proud Aboriginal footballer who cannot speak back.\n\"It was a calculated moment, delivered with a smile, met with laughter.\n\"It was a public humiliation of a man who should be remembered with honour.\"\nBen McClellan\nDunstall is yet to speak publicly since being drawn into the fallout from the Rioli Jnr social media post attacking Hawthorn in which he said he 'hated' the club.\nThe post came hours after Port Adelaide beat Hawthron. At the end of the spiteful game Rioli Jnr was pushed in the back while scoring a goal after taunting Hawks defender Changkuoth Jiath by holding out the ball towards him before kicking the major. He was then awarded a free kick in the goal square and kicked his second goal in as many minutes.\nDunstall's speech also came in the midst of Rioli Jnr's cousin Cyril Rioli's racism suit against the Hawks. The four-time premiership Hawk and other former Hawthorn Indigenous players late last year settled a federal court case with the club over racism claims.\nRioli Jnr took leave from Port Adelaide after he was subjected to racial abuse online over his post but returned to training on Wednesday and is expected to play against the Swans on Sunday.\nPower coach Ken Hinkley called out the racists who had attacked his player and called for tougher punishments for those that peddle racist hate online.\nPeris, who campaigned for the Voice in 2023, wrote Dunstall's anecdote was deeply offensive.\n\"What astounds me is that Dunstall chose to mock an Aboriginal man, a minority of minorities. Someone who didn't even get to go on to play a senior AFL game,\" she wrote.\n\"What was there to gain from that? Out of the entirety of what he could have said as a newly inducted legend, he chose to kick someone who isn't here to defend himself.\nThe Sport Australia Hall of Fame member, one of only nine Indigenous names on that honour roll among 450, also addressed Dunstall directly.\n\"Jason Dunstall, you had a moment to elevate the game along with your new status. Instead, you chose to belittle,\" she wrote.\n\"You tarnished what should have been a sacred night. You mocked a man who cannot defend himself. You humiliated a son who is still playing our great game. And you reminded every young Aboriginal child watching that even our dead are not safe.\n\"To Willie Rioli Jr, I say this:\n\"You spoke from the heart. You stood up for your father. You stood up for your people. You are not alone. Keep shining because you are the light in the darkness.

      "content": "Lauren Zonfrillo, the widow of MasterChef judge Jock Zonfrillo, has offered an intimate glimpse into her life after loss, detailing her emotional struggles and coping strategies in the wake of her husband's sudden death.\nJock Zonfrillo, was found dead at just 46-years-old in a Melbourne hotel room on May 1, 2023.\nIt prompted widespread speculation due to his well-publicised history of drug abuse and mental health battles.\nHe left behind Lauren and their two young children, Alfie and Isla, as well as daughters Ava and Sofia from previous marriages.\nAt the time of Zonfrillo's death, Lauren was in Italy and reportedly became concerned when her husband failed to keep to their usual daily schedule of telephone calls.\nA senior Victoria Police source told Daily Mail Australia that officers who attended Zagame's House in Carlton found Zonfrillo dead in his bed and saw no obvious signs of anything suspicious or unusual.\nIn an extract from her upcoming memoir, Till Death Do Us Part, published in the current edition of the Women's Weekly, Lauren recounted her experience of her first birthday without Jock.\nThe extract of Lauren's book reveals how she turned to prescription drugs and cannabis oil to cope after Jock's passing.\n\"I started crying the night before and continued for hours in bed, so I took a sleeping tablet, and then when I woke up the next morning, the tears instantly started again.\"\nIf you'd like to view this content, please adjust your Cookie Settings.\nTo find out more about how we use cookies, please see our Cookie Guide.\nShe then vividly described the morning of her birthday and the reactions of her children: \"The kids came into my room in the morning, and without even saying anything, Alfie went downstairs to the freezer, got me two ice packs, came back upstairs and told me to put them on my head.\"\nShe added, \"I said it was my birthday, and the response I got was to be asked when they would be able to eat some of my cake.\"\nLauren writes that as friends called and texted with birthday messages, she turned off her phone \"so I could cry and feel sorry for myself uninterrupted\".\nMax Corstorphan\nDescribing her preparations for a birthday lunch with friends, Lauren shared, \"I was now maybe an hour and a half away from needing to leave for my birthday lunch with friends, so I climbed out of bed, took a couple of beta-blockers and some CBD oil, had a shower and got in an Uber.\"\nLater, she met friends including her late husband's fellow MasterChef judge Andy Allen and his wife Alex, where she \"burst into tears\".\nLauren had assumed the first year after Zonfrillo's death would be the hardest, particularly because of all the 'firsts' she and the family would experience without him, but that was not the case, she said \"'That may be true for the first Christmas or Mother's Day, but they actually come in waves each year, and some are freak waves I didn't see coming\".\nLauren also reflected on the challenges of single parenthood, sharing, \"An agreement I made with myself early on was that good enough was good enough.\"\nIf you'd like to view this content, please adjust your Cookie Settings.\nTo find out more about how we use cookies, please see our Cookie Guide.\nThe police found no drug paraphernalia at the scene and formed the initial view that Zonfrillo had died of natural causes.\nLauren has never publicly discussed Zonfrillo's cause of death and a spokeswoman for Victoria's Coroners Court told Daily Mail Australia in February that the August 2024 findings of an investigation would not be published.\nTill Death Do Us Part, published by Penguin Books Australia, will be released on May 6.\nBefore his death, Zonfrillo had been preparing for the launch of MasterChef's 15th season and planning a new restaurant.\nIt has been reported that Zonfrillo and his wife had put their four-bedroom Carlton terrace up for rent ahead of a potential permanent move to Italy, where his father was born.\nThe Daily Mail previously revealed Zonfrillo had been diagnosed with bowel cancer in mid 2021, after recovering from an earlier bout with the disease. It is not suggested the cancer killed Zonfrillo, only that he had told friends its return was detected after a routine colonoscopy.\nMax Corstorphan\nA fortnight after Zonfrillo's death his wife led about 200 mourners who gathered for a funeral at Macquarie Park Cemetery and Crematorium at North Ryde on May 13.\nLauren was among the pallbearers and delivered a eulogy, before his friend and fellow Scotsman, Jimmy Barnes, sang Amazing Grace with his daughter Mahalia.\nZonfrillo joined the MasterChef Australia judging panel in 2020 with food critic Melissa Leong and restaurateur Andy Allen after original judges George Calombaris, Gary Mehigan and Matt Preston left.\nDaily Mail Australia's Inside Mail revealed Liz Hayes would interview Lauren in her first assignment for Seven's Spotlight program after leaving Nine's 60 Minutes.\nSign up for our emails\nFind out More\n(c) West Australian Newspapers Limited 2025",

      "summary": "In a dramatic twist, Xanadu Mines has delayed the vote on a 25% sell-down of its Kharmagtai copper-gold project in Mongolia to Zijin, hinting at talks around bigger corporate plays. The big question is: Why?",
      "content": "When veteran geologist Colin Moorhead took up the invitation to chair Xanadu Mines in late 2019, the veteran geologist was under no illusions.\nThe company, which owns a controlling interest in the massive Kharmagtai project in Mongolia - hosting 4.7 million tonnes of copper and 11 million ounces of gold - needed a major reset if it was ever going to generate a solid return for shareholders.\nAfter Xanadu acquired 76.5 per cent of Kharmagtai in 2014, the market was buzzing at the prospect of a minnow getting its hands on a discovery credited to Canadian-listed Ivanhoe Mines, led by legendary mining entrepreneur Robert Friedland.\nFor a few years Xanadu was flying high. The share price jumped 10-fold to 30 cents by 2018 before the sheer size of funding required to develop the project on the back of the junior mining company's modest bank balance eventually proved too much.\nThe message was crystal clear. Shareholders were demanding a fresh set of eyes, pushing the seasoned rock kicker to change the narrative.\nRather than developing up a small oxide deposit to start with - a strategy flawed by low grades, poor recoveries and high strip ratios - Xanadu would need to focus its attention instead on growing the resource through systematic drilling programs.\nWithin six months, the company's senior ranks were bolstered with the addition of Spencer Cole - another ex-Newcrest executive - as chief financial officer.\nBy the end of 2020, a new plan had been hatched.\nIf Xanadu could unlock enough value in Kharmagtai's copper potential to draw the interest of some major mining houses, there was an even money chance management could trigger a liquidity event.\nBacked to the tune of $12 million in fresh capital from new institutions and cornerstone investors, Xanadu immediately set about peppering the deposit with 20 kilometres of drill testing.\nThe deposit steadily grew and on the back of a positive scoping study in early 2022, Xanadu convinced the $100 billion Chinese mining giant, Zijin Mining Group, to step up to the plate and back the project with a funding deal.\nThe two-pronged agreement involved Zijin sinking $12.8M into Xanadu in exchange for 19.99 per cent of the company. But the real muscle came in the form of a US$35M (A$55M) cash injection into a newly minted joint venture (JV).\nThe JV structure elevated Zijin's funding of Kharmagtai to project level, allowing it to complete a pivotal prefeasibility study.\nXanadu and Zijin own an even split in the JV through Khuiten Metals, which controls 76.5 per cent of the project, effectively providing Xanadu with a 38.25 per cent interest in the mammoth copper-gold project.\nAfter sealing the landmark deal, the joint venture revealed Kharmagtai's jaw-dropping global resource.\nA whopping 730Mt of that bounty now sits in the reserve category, packing in 1.6Mt of copper and 4M ounces of gold at grades of 0.21 per cent and 0.17 grams per tonne (g/t), respectively.\nBut the serious sizzle lies in high-grade core - punching well above its weight with 100Mt at a copper equivalent grade of 0.8 per cent. This rich centrepiece could drive early returns and fast-track Kharmagtai's transformation into a globally significant producer.\nLate last year the long-awaited feasibility study was also handed down on Kharmagtai revealing a net present value of US$930M (A$1.45B) using an 8 per cent discount rate against a capital cost of US$890M (A$1.4B) to produce an annual EBITDA of US$293M (A$458M).\nWith a forecast production of up to 80,000t per annum of copper and 170,000 ounces of gold at a cost of 70c per pound copper, the project is forecast to wash its face within four years. It has a staggering 29-year mine life.\nThe release of the prefeasibility study did more than just outline the economics - it also opened a pathway for the final stage of the original funding agreement with Zijin.\nXanadu finds itself sitting in the box seat, armed with not one, but three strategic levers that could unlock serious value for shareholders.\nThe company's first option is to simply roll up the sleeves and co-fund its 50 per cent share of project construction alongside Zijin, which would involve sourcing north of A$700M in fresh funding.\nOption two gives Xanadu the right - but not the obligation - to cash in half of its remaining stake in the JV for a cool US$25M. Zijin would also foot all of Xanadu's construction bill via an interest-bearing loan to be repaid out of future project revenues.\nThe third - and boldest - option on the table is to sell the lot. If Xanadu chooses to offload its full remaining 50 per cent stake, it would walk away with a war chest of US$50M in cold, hard cash.\nFaced with these various alternatives, Xanadu's board picked option two, which still lets the company ride the upside without having to raise a dime upfront. The board was then due to hold an extraordinary meeting on April 11 to gain shareholder approval.\nHowever, in a dramatic twist worthy of a corporate thriller, Xanadu Mines hit the pause button on the key shareholder meeting - just as the final stage of its game-changing deal with Zijin Mining was set to be rubber-stamped.\nInstead, the company has inked a Deed of Variation with Zijin, pushing back the expiry of a lucrative 25 per cent put option by at least 30 days after their current exclusivity period lapses.\nThe move, cloaked in secrecy, has been made to allow both parties more time to thrash out a range of potential corporate manoeuvres, hinting that something far bigger could be brewing behind the scenes.\nUnder the terms of the extension, Zijin retains exclusivity through a classic 'no shop, no talk, no due diligence' clause, preventing Xanadu from entertaining any rival suitors - for now.\nBut the delay has sparked speculation that the original deal terms with Zijin might be on the negotiating table, with room for a sweeter outcome.

      "ml_hf_summary": "Xanadu Mines, a junior mining company, acquired a controlling interest in the Kharmagtai copper-gold project in Mongolia in 2014.  After facing financial challenges and market pressure for a fresh strategy, Xanadu shifted its focus to resource growth through systematic drilling programs. In 2020, they secured funding from new investors and initiated drilling at Kharmagtai. This led to the discovery of a significant copper-gold deposit with a global resource estimate of 730Mt.  A joint venture agreement with Zijin Mining Group was finalized in 2021, securing US$35M for the project and enabling a prefeasibility study. The study revealed a positive economic outlook with a net present value of US$930M and a forecast production of copper and gold within four years.  Xanadu now has three options: co-fund construction alongside Zijin, exercise their put option to sell half their stake, or sell the entire project.  The company extended the deal's exclusivity period with Zijin, delaying shareholder approval for the final stage of the agreement. This delay has sparked speculation about potential negotiations and new bids for the project. \n"

      "content": "Share This article\nLeaders and organizers of the UniteUS movement say they saw an \"incredible end to the best semester\" while closing out their year of outreaches at Baylor University this week. \nNearly 5,000 students jammed into Foster Pavilion to worship Jesus, hear the Gospel, and have their lives transformed by the love of God, UniteUS reported. And hundreds of them, close to 250, made decisions for Christ, the ministry confirmed.\nA post shared by Tonya Prewett (@tonyaprew)\nCBN News has followed the ministry's outreach each month since the start of the school year.\nThe organization kicked off its 2025 events in February at the University of Kentucky where nearly 8,000 students packed Rupp Arena and more than 2,000 students responded to a message about Jesus Christ. Many others took part in spontaneous baptisms. \nThen, a few weeks later, an Ohio State revival event saw 6,500 students gather in The Schottenstein Center, where hundreds once again responded to an altar call.\nSince then, thousands of other students have participated in these revival-type events. \nUniteUS founder and organizer Tonya Prewett, Pastor Jonathan Pokluda, and the founder of the IF:Gathering, Jennie Allen, traveled to Purdue University, West Virginia University, and Southern Methodist University before stopping at Baylor. \nUnlike most of the other colleges UniteUS visits, Baylor University's campus culture is steeped in the Christian faith. \nAs CBN News reported, thousands of students at Baylor gathered together earlier this month for a period of 72 hours to continuously ask God for revival on their campus in Waco, Texas. \nStudents stood shoulder to shoulder under a nearly 10,000-square-foot canopy each night for FM72 to worship, pray, and celebrate their fellow students who made decisions for Jesus Christ. \nOver the course of three days, 35 students gave their lives to the Lord. \nHowever, there was a fire still burning among the students to have more of God. \nPrewett told CBN News that speakers traveled to the campus and focused on sharing with students about their God-given purpose and identity Tuesday night. \n\"Hundreds came forward to accept a call of God on their lives,\" she said. \"One particular student announced that he had been studying law but felt that night that God was calling him into full-time missions.\"\n Please sign up for CBN Newsletters to ensure you keep receiving the latest updates from a distinctly Christian perspective. \nEven more remarkable is a story Prewett shared that illustrates how Jesus stops for the one. \n\"We heard a testimony of a student who said he has been an atheist his whole life. He was studying at Common Grounds and saw a big crowd of students walking. He decided to follow them, which led him to Unite. He surrendered his life to the Lord a couple of hours later,\" she said. \nAccording to the school's website, Baylor's student body comes from 49 states and more than 85 countries, and is a mix of many faith and non-faith traditions, including atheists, Muslims, and Buddhists. \nSo the prayers from the Christian community are not in vain, but have been integral to how the Spirit of God has moved through UniteUS, Prewett explained.\nA post shared by Jennie Allen (@jennieallen)\n\"One thing that we have noticed this semester is the amount of prayer that students [have] invested leading up to their events and the power and presence that we felt because of those prayers,\" she explained.\nPokluda says the entire experience this semester has been amazing and shared in a social media post that he is asking God to do more. He also urged young believers to share their faith. \n\"There are nonbelievers all around you waiting for you to share The Gospel with them,\" he wrote. \n Since September of 2023, the ministry's events have reached more than 100,000 college students across multiple campuses and close to 13,000 students have given their lives to Jesus. \n\"God showed up and did it again,\" reads a post from the ministry. \"We will never get over the sight of students giving their all to Jesus in worship and experiencing true freedom in His presence.\"\nIt continued, \"Thank you, Lord, for how you are moving in this generation!\"\nShare This article \n Talia Wise has served as a multi-media producer for CBNNews.com, CBN Newswatch, The Prayer Link, and CBN News social media outlets.

      "content": "Manage your account \n ...\nGlobal Fight League is failing to honor its commitments to fighters in the wake of recent event cancellations, according to longtime MMA manager Lloyd Pierson.\nIn a statement issued to Uncrowned's Ariel Helwani on Thursday, Pierson, who represents multiple fighters signed to the GFL, accused the organization of failing to live up to promises made to fighters, causing them financial harm.\n\"At its inception, GFL came on the MMA scene seeking attention by promising fighters large sums of money,\" Pierson wrote. \"Many fighters relied on these promises and, when GFL failed to deliver, have been financially harmed and forced to participate in prolonged fight camps for bouts that now will not occur.\"\nGFL recently announced the cancellation of planned inaugural events scheduled for Los Angeles this month, insisting that the events may take place in June, while citing funding issues. This was one of several troubling shifts, according to Pierson, who, as executive vice president and head of combat sports for VaynerSports, represents multiple GFL fighters including Urijah Faber, Chris Weidman, Tony Ferguson and others.\n\"GFL and their CEO Darren Owen began recruiting top-level fighters during the last few months of 2024, offering fighters large financial purses and guaranteeing the ability to fight three times during the 2025 calendar year,\" Pierson wrote in his statement to Uncrowned. \"Relying on these promises, many fighters left previous promotions and made other difficult decisions for themselves and their families to pursue the GFL opportunity.\"\nAccording to Pierson, Owen attempted to address concerns about the GFL's financial stability by \"circulating copies and photos of the GFL bank account, showing they had over $20 million in funding.\"\nUncrowned reached out to the GFL founder Owen, who said in a text message that he had requested proof of funds from a primary investor.\n\"To do so, he transferred $20 million into our bank account to prove he had the funds,\" Owen wrote. \"He transferred the funds out of the account the same day. We had a monthly schedule of funds typically in the $200,000 per month range that he had been funding without issue until April. Whether it was the market crash or him getting cold feet, he did not fulfill his April obligation and subsequently halted our progress.\"\nAccording to Pierson, the funding woes resulted in some fighters failing to receive monthly stipends that were contractually guaranteed to them. This came with no prior warning, Pierson said, and has been accompanied by other sudden changes in GFL's assurances to fighters.\n\"Now, with apparent lack of funding for the GFL, Darren is asking fighters to compete for free,\" Pierson wrote. \"He has circulated a document showing a revenue share model for the fighters -- a complete deviation from their contracted amounts. According to some fighters, the GFL is projecting to make almost $4 million from this event at the low end. Anyone who has been involved with fight promotion knows that this is unrealistic and flat out not truthful. The fact that these numbers are being circulated as reasonable estimates clearly demonstrates the disconnect between the GFL, their audience, and the current market.\"\nThe offer of a revenue share in lieu of contracted pay was also mentioned by former UFC fighter Alan Belcher, who on his Instagram page this week referred to GFL as \"for lack of a better word, a scam.\"\nAccording to Belcher, after the initial GFL event cancellation, Owen offered him \"some revenue share and stuff if I would fight for not a guaranteed purse.\"\nOwen told Uncrowned that a revenue share model was one possibility that has been discussed informally, but no official offers of that kind were made.\n\"In an effort to stage an event as soon as possible, potentially with a lower investment amount, we have explored different approaches to achieving this,\" Owen wrote in a text message. \"We have discussed the possibility of fighters competing for revenue or profit sharing, however we have not made any decisions on that nor have we made any official offers to anyone.\"\nOwen said the GFL is in \"active negotiation with a number of investors,\" and plans to proceed with events \"when we have secured the necessary funds.\"\nAs for claims that fighters' stipends were cut off, Owen said that those who were eligible for those payments had received them through the month of April.\n\"We do have some fighters that were receiving purse advances,\" Owen wrote. \"I believe all that were eligible based on their deliverables were in fact paid for April. As of now we have not breached any of those agreements.\"\nIn his statement, Pierson said that fighters were struggling with sudden shifts in not only the terms of their agreements with GFL, but also the repeated changes surrounding event dates for GFL's inaugural shows.\n\"In January, GFL conducted an extremely disorganized public draft process, where the number of teams was unexpectedly reduced from eight to six. Prior to and immediately following the draft, fighters were informed that the initial GFL event would take place in late April in Los Angeles. Shortly after that announcement, the GFL moved the inaugural event to May 11-12, which was confirmed in official letters to fighters and in bout agreements.\n\"Following this change, Owen confirmed there would absolutely be no more changes to this date. Again, reassuring fighters of upcoming bouts and to continue with the strenuous camps. Recently, without prior warning, Owen once again changed the event dates to May 24-25. During this period, some fighters received bout agreements that did not align with their contracted amounts, while others didn't receive bout agreements at all,\" Pierson wrote.\nAccording to Owen, the total money between bout agreements and addendums \"did equal the promotional agreement amount\" for all fighters.\n\"Our goal is to honor all agreements we have in place,\" Owen wrote. \"I don't believe we have breached any agreements as of now. We have had one athlete to date who has requested and received their release. We will resume operations as soon as possible.\"\nThere has thus far been no official confirmation of a date and venue for any upcoming GFL events. Pierson called it \"extremely alarming\" that any fighter would still consider participating in GFL bouts under these conditions.\n\"Two pervasive problems in the MMA community have been poor representation and a lack of solidarity among fighters,\" Pierson wrote. \"We, as leaders in the representation of fighters, must continue to fight for our clients, including educating them against accepting egregious deals such as that presented by the GFL. Additionally, the MMA community must stand together and recognize that through solidarity we can protect all fighters against fraudulent and predatory behavior by upstart fight promoters. These professional athletes must recognize their worth and refuse to compete without fair compensation.\n\"The GFL needs to secure legitimate funding if they wish to operate in the MMA space. Fighters should stand united in refusing to accept such treatment from emerging promotions.\"",
      "ml_hf_summary": "Global Fight League (GFL) is facing financial difficulties, leading to cancellations of planned events and a dispute with fighters over payment.  Longtime manager Lloyd Pierson alleges that GFL promised large sums of money to fighters, which they failed to deliver on, causing financial harm. The organization has recently canceled its inaugural events in Los Angeles and shifted event dates multiple times, leaving fighters uncertain about their contracts and stipends. GFL founder Darren Owen claims he is actively seeking investors and negotiating with them, but the company's funding situation remains unclear.  Several fighters have expressed skepticism about GFL's financial stability and have accused the organization of engaging in predatory practices. \n"
