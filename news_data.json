            "content": "<p>Andrew and Tristan Tate, the controversial British-American social media influencers accused of rape, human trafficking and money laundering, have been freed from travel restrictions in Romania after several high-level White House officials took an interest in their case.\nIt's unclear what, if any, role Donald Trump's administration may have played in their release, but one of Trump's top envoys is said to have raised the case with Romania's Foreign Minister Emil Hurezeanu at a security conference in Munich earlier this month.\nAndrew Tate rose to fame after appearing on the UK reality show Big Brother, and later making a series of extreme and controversial statements about women and politics on social media.\nThe pair ran a webcam business and were charged with human trafficking and rape along with two Romanian female suspects in June 2023. \nThey also face separate, unrelated allegations of rape and human trafficking in the UK, and civil suits in the US and UK. They deny all the allegations, which their US lawyer calls \"defamatory and unequivocally false\".\nOn Thursday the brothers arrived in Florida after previously being banned from leaving Romania while the case against them is pending.\nLawyers for the pair say they will return to Bucharest for court hearings. \nWhen asked about the Tates at the White House on Thursday, President Trump said: \"I know nothing about that.\"\nBut the brothers have been the subject of recent high-level discussions between the US and Romania.\nRomanian officials say US counterparts brought up the brothers' case with the Romanian government earlier this month, a story first reported by the Financial Times.\nAnd Trump special envoy Richard Grenell raised the issue again at a security conference in Munich.\nHurezeanu said the Tates were mentioned during that conversation, but denied being pressured to release the pair.\nThe Tate brothers are Trump supporters and also have ties to figures in his administration.\nOne of Tate's lawyers now works as White House liaison to the US justice department.\nPaul Ingrassia was part of a team representing the Tate brothers in a defamation lawsuit they filed in Florida against several of their alleged victims.\nIngrassia also acted as Tate's publicist and says he got the influencer onto a show hosted by Tucker Carlson, the former Fox News host. \nHe has praised Tate in online posts. In one dating from July 2023, he called Tate \"an extraordinary human being\" who was offering \"a dying West some hope for renewal\".\nIngrassia did not respond to a request for comment on Thursday.\nThe Tates have also been talked about by several people in Trump's orbit, including Donald Trump Jr and Elon Musk.\nTrump Jr once called Tate's detention in Romania \"absolute insanity\". \nMusk reinstated Andrew Tate's account, which had been banned on X, and suggested, perhaps in jest, that Tate would make a good UK prime minister.\nJoseph McBride, a lawyer representing the Tates in a defamation case they have filed against several of their accusers in Florida, said in a statement: \"They feel secure in America for several reasons, the primary one being that Donald Trump is the president.\"\nThe statement alleged that the Tates and others are victims of \"weaponised legal systems\" and \"politically motivated prosecutions\".\nMcBride did not respond to questions on whether White House officials played any role in the removal of travel restrictions against the Tate brothers.\nTrump and his advisers know the political power of the manosphere – a popular and very online subculture that attracts fans of mixed martial arts fighting, video games, cryptocurrencies and other stereotypically male pursuits.\nIt's a sprawling scene that includes men who reject the company of women entirely, a \"pick-up artist\" scene filled with tips on how to find casual hookups, and plenty of mainstream podcasts and YouTube channels filled with bro-type humour.\nThe president's advisers targeted the same audiences during last year's election campaign, when Trump, JD Vance and others in his orbit went on podcasts and did interviews with new media outlets. \nThe views of the Tate brothers lie at one of the manosphere's extreme edges. Andrew Tate himself has made no secret of his self-described misogynist – women-hating – and sexist views.\nOn podcasts and online clips he talks about how women are property, how men shouldn't allow girlfriends to go out without them or talk to other men.\nIn extremely graphic language, he's described violence against women and talked about how sexual assault victims bear responsibility for rape.\nTate and his brother at the same time sell a glamorous lifestyle of expensive properties, cigars and luxury cars that includes self-improvement messages directed at young men - an image that garnered him a large audience before he was booted off most mainstream social media platforms.\nHe told the BBC in a 2023 interview: \"I preach hard work, discipline. I'm an athlete, I preach anti-drugs, I preach religion, I preach no alcohol, I preach no knife crime. Every single problem with modern society I'm against.\"\nLike many other extreme influencers, in the face of criticism he often claims his posts are satire or jokes, mocking his detractors as his messages spread further, propelled by online outrage.\nThe pair's supporters were thrilled with his release and eager to proclaim their innocence, despite the outstanding charges against them.\nFour British women who have filed a civil lawsuit against Andrew Tate meanwhile issued a statement calling on UK authorities to \"take action\", saying they were \"in disbelief and feel re-traumatised by the news\".\nAnd support for the Tates is far from universal among Trump supporters and American conservatives, many of whom moved to immediately distance themselves from the brothers.\nRon DeSantis, the governor of Florida, where Tates landed on Thursday, said of their activities: \"Florida is not a place where you're welcome with that type of conduct.\"\nThe state's attorney general later said he would open a preliminary inquiry into the Tates and said Florida has \"zero tolerance for human trafficking and violence against women\".\nIn the conservative Washington Examiner, podcaster Brady Leonard wrote: \"Tate's obnoxious, misogynistic brand is toxic to everyone besides electorally insignificant corners of social media.\"\nMatt Lewis, a US conservative political commentator who has been critical of Trump in the past, said advocating on behalf of Tate \"fits in with the ethos of the Maga world right now, which is: 'let's be tough guys'\".\n\"But I also think it speaks to a legitimate problem, which we have seen in the last couple decades, a problem with men...where there's an epidemic of loneliness, a sense the world is passing them by, a sense that modernity has made it harder to be successful as a husband and a father. I think that's had some real psychic effects,\" he said.\n\"There's a pretty good contingency of Trump's supporters who are probably going to welcome this guy and probably even see him as a victim of persecution.\" \nThe annual festivities in Washington DC can be more akin to a marathon, as Mark Carruthers explains.\nThe US president cites the armed group's recent attacks in the Red Sea as justification.\nMaking good on a campaign promise, Trump has invoked the law to deport Venezuelans, but legal challenges remain.\nThe unpredictable storms have hit Missouri, Texas and Oklahoma, whipping up fires and overturning trucks.\nAt least 20 people have died after tornadoes and severe storms tore through central and southern states.\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

            "content": "<p>Arlington National Cemetery has scrubbed from its website information and educational materials about the history of black and female service members. \nSome of the content unpublished from the site was on veterans who had received the nation's highest military recognition, the Medal of Honor, according to military news site Task &amp; Purpose.\nThe content removal is part of a larger effort by President Donald Trump to eliminate diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) practices in the military and throughout the federal government.\nApproximately 400,000 veterans are buried in the Army-run cemetery, which was established after the US Civil War at the home of the South's general, Robert E. Lee.\nOn the cemetery's website, internal links that directed users to webpages with information about the \"Notable Graves\" of dozens of black, Hispanic and female veterans were missing on Friday. \nThe pages contained short biographies about veterans such as Gen Colin L Powell, the first black chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, which is the highest rank in the military after the president. \nThey also told the life stories of members of the Tuskegee Airmen, the country's first black military airmen. \nEarlier this year, the Defense Department had to reinstate training materials on the revered airmen after a national outcry over their removal following Trump's orders on DEI.\nInformation on Hector Santa Anna, a World War II bomber pilot and career military leader who has been called a hero of the war, has been taken down, as well.\nVisitors to the site may also have trouble finding information, as links to major sections have disappeared. It no longer lists pages for African American History, Hispanic American History and Women's History.\nContent still exists on some notable women buried there, including former Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and 14 veterans from the unit recently featured in the Oscar-nominated movie The Six Triple Eight, but it is only found from a direct search.\nSince re-entering the White House, President Donald Trump has signed multiple executive orders banning DEI within the federal government.\nA spokesperson for the cemetery said in a statement it was working to restore links and content and remained \"committed to sharing the stories of military service and sacrifice to the nation\", according to the Washington Post. \nIt added that it wanted to ensure that the content aligned with Trump's orders and also with instructions from Secretary of Defence Pete Hegseth.\nRepresentative Adam Smith, the top Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee, condemned the content removal.\n\"The whole thing is deeply concerning,\" Smith said in an interview with the New York Times. \n\"Even if you have concerns about the way DEI was handled in a number of different places, I've never seen a problem within the military.\"\nTrump has made dramatic changes in the military in his second term, including firing the country's top general, CQ Brown, a black man who had supported diversity in the armed forces.\nSecretary Hegseth - a former Fox News host and military veteran - has pledged to root out all diversity initiatives and had accused Gen Brown of being \"woke\". \nThere are 2.03m people serving in the US military on active duty or in reserves, with 30% identifying as part of a minority group such as black or Native American and 18% as Hispanic or Latino, according to the latest Defense Department report. One-fifth of those in the military are women. \nThe annual festivities in Washington DC can be more akin to a marathon, as Mark Carruthers explains.\nThe US president cites the armed group's recent attacks in the Red Sea as justification.\nMaking good on a campaign promise, Trump has invoked the law to deport Venezuelans, but legal challenges remain.\nThe unpredictable storms have hit Missouri, Texas and Oklahoma, whipping up fires and overturning trucks.\nAt least 20 people have died after tornadoes and severe storms tore through central and southern states.\nCopyright 2025 BBC.
